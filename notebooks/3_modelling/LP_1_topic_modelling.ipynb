        "Crucially, the \"Apple\" anomaly is not present in the top words of any topic for k=11, suggesting a cleaner separation of terms.\n",
        "While some conversational noise is still present (Topics 2, 4, 9 in k=11), the quality of the interpretable topics is high.\n",
        "k=12, k=13, k=14: Beyond k=11, the topics generally become more fragmented, or reintroduce the \"Apple\" anomaly, and the number of less coherent/conversational topics increases, making overall interpretation more challenging. For example, k=12 recombines \"funding/deposits\" with \"severance/headcount\", which is less ideal.\n",
        "Therefore, my strongest recommendation is k=11. It provides a good level of detail for key financial aspects of Goldman Sachs' earnings calls while offering significantly improved topic coherence and distinctiveness, and effectively mitigating some of the persistent noise terms seen in other k values."
