        "Conclusion and Recommendation\n",
        "The addition of stopwords has certainly helped in some areas, making certain topics clearer. However, some conversational noise still persists, especially words related to the Q&A format or general conversational patterns. The term \"Apple\" continues to be grouped with \"deposit\" in some k values, which is still a bit puzzling without specific context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on this comprehensive analysis, the most sensible k value is a trade-off between granularity, coherence, and minimizing \"junk\" topics.\n",
        "\n",
        "k=8: Offers good clarity for key themes (Credit Card, Headcount/Severance, Asset/Fundraising), but is still quite broad and has some remaining conversational noise.\n",
        "k=9: Introduces very strong \"GSIB\" and \"Wealth Management\" topics.\n",
        "k=10: Shows strong \"Investment/Platform\" and \"Fundraising\" themes.\n",
        "k=11: This k value demonstrates the best balance in this new set of runs.\n",
        "It produces several very distinct and interpretable financial/business topics: \"Wealth Management/European Footprint\" , \"Severance/Headcount/Capital\" , \"Credit Card/Consumer\" , \"GSIB/Allocation\" , \"Bank/Acquisition/Advisory\" , \"FICC/Equity/Commodity\" , and \"Deposit/Capital/Market/Exposure\".\n",
        "\n",
        "Crucially, the \"Apple\" anomaly is not present in the top words of any topic for k=11, suggesting a cleaner separation of terms.\n",
        "While some conversational noise is still present (Topics 2, 4, 9 in k=11), the quality of the interpretable topics is high.\n",
        "k=12, k=13, k=14: Beyond k=11, the topics generally become more fragmented, or reintroduce the \"Apple\" anomaly, and the number of less coherent/conversational topics increases, making overall interpretation more challenging. For example, k=12 recombines \"funding/deposits\" with \"severance/headcount\", which is less ideal.\n",
        "Therefore, my strongest recommendation is k=11. It provides a good level of detail for key financial aspects of Goldman Sachs' earnings calls while offering significantly improved topic coherence and distinctiveness, and effectively mitigating some of the persistent noise terms seen in other k values."
