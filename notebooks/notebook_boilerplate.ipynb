This call is being recorded today , April 18, 2023.\\nThank you. Ms. Halio, you may begin your conference.\\nCarey Halio\\nGood morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations and Chief Strategy\\nOfﬁcer , Goldman Sachs. W elcome to our ﬁrst quarter earnings conference call.\\nToday we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the\\nInvestor Relations page of our website at www .gs.com. Note information on forward-\\nlooking statements and non-GAAP  measures appear on the earnings release and\\npresentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group\\nInc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent.\\nI am joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , David Solomon, and\\nour Chief Financial Ofﬁcer , Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David.\\nDavid Solomon\\nThanks, Carey , and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us.\\nIn the ﬁrst quarter , we delivered solid performance in a challenging environment. W e\\nproduced net revenues of $12.2 billion and generated earnings per share of $8.79\\nand an ROE of 1 1.6% and an ROTE of 12.6%. The ﬁrst quarter was certainly volatile,\\nparticularly for the banking sector . After a fairly benign operating environment at the\\nstart of the year , in March, we witnessed the collapse of two regional banks in the\\nUnited States.\\nStress quickly spread to a number of institutions across the ﬁnancial sector where we\\nsaw ratings downgrades and steep valuation declines in very short order . These\\nstresses were not limited to the U.S., as we saw when regulators help arrange the\\ncombination of Switzerland's two largest ﬁnancial institutions.\\nIt's important to appreciate the size of the disruption. Some of the market moves\\nduring the period were staggering, particularly in interest rates. To give you a sense\\nof the magnitude, there have been just four days in the past 25 years that have seen\\ntwo-year yields move by 50 basis points or more intraday . One was in September\\n2008 and three of them occurred in mid-March this year . Monday , March 13th was\\nthe biggest one-day move in the U.S. Treasury two-year yield in over 35 years.\\nAs we sit here today , it appears that the worst of the volatility is behind us. Prompt\\naction by regulators was vital in bolstering conﬁdence and stabilizing market\\nsentiment. The events of the ﬁrst quarter acted as another real-life stress test and\\nthey demonstrated the resilience of the country's largest ﬁnancial institutions.\\nThe G-SIBs have been a source of strength for the ﬁnancial system. W e joined a\\nconsortium with 10 other large institutions in making a $30 billion uninsured term\\ndeposit into First Republic Bank to send the strong vote of conﬁdence in and\\ncommitment to the U.S. banking sector .\\nAs for Goldman Sachs, our long-standing and deeply rooted risk management\\nculture helped us navigate this unusual environment. In our 154-year history , we\\nhave lived and managed through many periods of disruption, and it's our rigorous\\nprocesses and planning for tailored scenarios before the stress that enable us to\\nreact quickly and ef fectively when they do occur .\\nWhile it's impossible to predict the exact form a market stress will take and we won't\\nalways execute perfectly , our risk management culture, strong liquidity , and robust\\ncapital position have allowed us to navigate a complex environment while also\\ncontinuing to actively support our clients.\\nGiven this backdrop, it was clear our clients needed help managing their risks and\\nturn to us for our expertise and execution capabilities. Both FICC and Equities had a\\nstrong quarter , as we helped clients with their intermediation and ﬁnancing needs.\\nUnderwriting activity , however , remained extremely muted and below recent\\naverages as capital markets were further delayed from reopening in a meaningful\\nway given the market disruption. All-in, Global Banking & Markets delivered industry-\\nleading returns of 16.6%, in line with our through-the-cycle targets even while\\nadvisory and capital markets activity remained muted. This franchise continues to\\nshow impressive resilience in a variety of market environments, given our broad and\\ndiversiﬁed set of businesses.\\nManagement fees across Asset & W ealth Management grew sequentially , but\\nsegment returns were in the mid-single-digits as our on-balance sheet investments\\nremained susceptible to volatility in asset prices. It is a strategic priority to continue to\\nreduce these positions. And while we've made progress, there is still work to do.\\nIn Platform Solutions, we saw positive underlying trends this quarter with revenues\\ngreater than provisions and we remain focused on driving this business towards\\nproﬁtability . We also continue to explore strategic alternatives within our consumer\\nplatform businesses.\\nIn the ﬁrst quarter , we sold a portion of our Marcus loan portfolio and transferred the\\nremainder to held-for-sale. While this activity is now reﬂected in our AWM segment, it\\nis an example of our narrowing our focus in the consumer space. Denis will take you\\nthrough the ﬁnancial impact of that momentarily .\\nAdditionally , we are now initiating the process to explore the sale of GreenSky . We\\nbelieve GreenSky is a good business and is performing well with ﬁrst quarter\\noriginations in our core home improvement loans up over 25% year-over-year and a\\nweighted FICO on total originations of over 780. Given our current strategic priorities\\nhowever , we may not be the best long-term holder of this business. W e will update\\nyou on our progress if and when there are material developments.\\nAs I close, I'd like to say a few words about the forward outlook. The recent events in\\nthe banking sector are lowering growth expectations and there is a higher risk of a\\ncredit contraction given the environment is limiting banks' appetites to extend credit.\\nThis is an acceleration of a trend and a situation we're watching closely . Businesses\\nand consumers continue to adjust to higher interest rates. While the forward\\ntrajectory is still unclear , we continue to be cautious about the economic outlook and\\nwe are operating the ﬁrm such that we are well prepared in the event that the\\nenvironment weakens further .\\nOverall, I feel very conﬁdent about the state of our client franchise and the long-term\\nopportunity set for Goldman Sachs. As the events of the past quarter have illustrated,\\nwe are operating from a position of strength and we have the people in place around\\nthe world to continue serving the broad range of clients' needs with excellence.\\nAnd while much has transpired since we held our Investor Day at the end of\\nFebruary , we remain focused on our strategy to strengthen our leading Global\\nBanking & Markets franchise and grow our Asset & W ealth Management business,\\nand we are committed to delivering for clients and shareholders.\\nI will now turn it over to Denis to cover our ﬁnancial results for the quarter in more\\ndetail.\\nDenis Coleman\\nThank you, David. Good morning.\\nLet's start with our results on page one of the presentation. In the ﬁrst quarter , we\\ngenerated net revenues of $12.2 billion and net earnings of $3.2 billion, resulting in\\nearnings per share of $8.79.\\nTurning to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Global Banking & Markets\\nproduced revenues of $8.4 billion in the ﬁrst quarter , which generated an industry-\\nleading ROE for the segment of 16.6%. Advisory revenues of $818 million were\\ndown 27% amid lower industry completions. Underwriting revenues continued to be\\nbelow recent averages and were lower year-over-year .\\nDespite the difﬁcult backdrop, we were number one in the league tables for\\ncompleted M&A  and high-yield debt underwriting. W e also ranked second for equity\\nand equity-related underwriting. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter , primarily in\\nAdvisory , but we remain cautiously optimistic on the outlook for the second half of the\\nyear and 2024, particularly for strategic M&A. W e also expect investors will need\\nmore certainty before ﬁnancing markets reopen broadly , but we have seen an\\nincrease in underwriting dialogs in the ﬁrst two weeks of the second quarter .\\nFICC net revenues were $3.9 billion in the quarter , down 17%, as one of our\\nstrongest sets of results in rates was more than of fset by signiﬁcantly lower\\ncurrencies and commodities revenues, which were very strong in the ﬁrst quarter of\\n2022. In FICC ﬁnancing, revenues rose slightly year-over-year .\\nEquities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter , down 7% year-on-year . A decline\\nin intermediation revenues was partially of fset by record ﬁnancing revenues of $1.3\\nbillion with the sequential increase driven by higher activity and increased balances\\ncoupled with improved customer spreads.\\nMoving to Asset & W ealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.2 billion rose\\n24% year-over-year , given improved results in equity and debt investments, and as\\nmanagement and other fees increased 12% year-over-year to a record $2.3 billion.\\nThough underlying trends in the business remained strong, private banking and\\nlending revenues of $354 million fell year-over-year , driven by the partial sale of our\\nMarcus unsecured loan portfolio as well as a transfer of the remaining portfolio to\\nheld-for-sale, in line with our strategic decision to narrow our consumer ambitions.\\nThe associated revenue reduction of $470 million was largely of fset by a reserve\\nrelease of $440 million. Additionally , we beneﬁted from NII and incremental reserve\\nreleases associated with paydowns. All-in, the Marcus loan portfolio was proﬁtable\\nfor the quarter .\\nNet revenues for equity investments were $1 19 million, driven by $229 million in\\nrevenues related to CIEs and $85 million of gains related to our $2 billion public\\nportfolio, partially of fset by $195 million of net losses on our $12 billion private equity\\nportfolio, primarily within real estate.\\nThis quarter , we experienced approximately $355 million of impairments on our CIE\\nportfolio, which are reﬂected in operating expenses. Debt investments revenues\\nwere $408 million, driven by net interest income of $363 million.\\nMoving on to Page 6, total ﬁrmwide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a\\nrecord $2.7 trillion, driven by $68 billion of market appreciation as well as $8 billion of\\nlong-term net inﬂows, representing our 21st consecutive quarter of long-term fee-\\nbased inﬂows. W e also saw a meaningful strength in liquidity products with $49\\nbillion of net inﬂows from new and existing clients amid the industry-wide ﬂows in the\\nmoney market funds.\\nTurning to Page 7 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $268\\nbillion at the end of the ﬁrst quarter , driving $494 million in management and other\\nfees for the quarter . Gross third-party fundraising was $14 billion, relatively solid\\ngiven the current environment, and bringing total third-party fundraising since our\\n2020 Investor Day to $193 billion. While we expect the pace of fundraising to slow for\\nthe rest of 2023, we continue to feel good about the path forward and remain\\nconﬁdent in achieving our 2024 target of $225 billion.\\nOn balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $57 billion, of which\\n$27 billion was related to our historical principal investment portfolio. Despite the\\nchallenging environment, we reduced these on balance sheet historical investments\\nby $2.3 billion in the quarter . We are committed to our strategy to reduce balance\\nsheet density , including reducing historical principal investment portfolio to less than\\n$15 billion by 2024 year-end.\\nI'll now turn to Platform Solutions on Page 8. Revenues of $564 million more than\\ndoubled year-over-year , driven by growth in loan balances in consumer platforms.\\nThis week, we announced the launch of a savings account for Apple Card users. W e\\nare excited to deepen our partnership with Apple through this additional of fering and\\nto introduce another source of deposit funding for the ﬁrm.\\nIn transaction banking, deposit balances ended the quarter slightly higher versus\\nyear-end, while revenues of $74 million were modestly lower quarter-over-quarter\\namid higher deposit costs. As we spoke about at our Investor Day in February , we're\\nfocused on further scaling this business with new clients and deepening our\\nrelationships with existing clients as we aspire to become their primary service\\nprovider . In this regard, we continue to see positive momentum on the platform as\\nour client count grew by approximately 20% in the ﬁrst quarter .\\nOn Page 9, ﬁrmwide net interest income of $1.8 billion in the ﬁrst quarter was down\\n14% relative to the fourth quarter , driven by increased funding costs supporting\\ntraining activities within Global Banking & Markets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter\\nend was $178 billion, essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter . Provision for\\ncredit losses reﬂected a net beneﬁt of $171 million, including the previously\\nmentioned reserve release associated with the Marcus unsecured lending portfolio\\nand model updates, which were only partially of fset by roughly $245 million in\\nconsumer net charge-of fs.\\nSpending a moment on our commercial real estate lending portfolio, as of quarter-\\nend, we had $29 billion of funded CRE loans. This portfolio is diversiﬁed by property\\ntype and includes $10 billion of exposure in the form of conservatively structured\\nwarehouse lending with typical L TVs of approximately 50%.\\nTurning to expenses on Page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.4\\nbillion. Our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was 33%. Quarterly\\nnon-compensation expenses were $4.3 billion, essentially unchanged versus the\\nfourth quarter , but up versus last year . The majority of the year-over-year increase\\nwas driven by the aforementioned CIE impairments as well as expenses related to\\nNNIP . Our ef fective tax rate for the quarter was 19%. For the full year , we expect a\\ntax rate between 21% and 22%.\\nTurning to capital on Slide 1 1. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.8% at the end\\nof the ﬁrst quarter under the standardized approach, 100 basis points above our\\ncurrent requirement and at the top end of our management buf fer. In the quarter , we\\nreturned $3.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of over\\n$2.5 billion and common stock dividends of roughly $870 million.\\nWhile we expect to continue to focus on sustainably growing our dividend, we would\\nnote that repurchases in any given quarter will vary . Though we ﬁnd our stock price\\nattractive at current levels in light of the current environment, we expect to moderate\\nour repurchase levels in the second quarter relative to the ﬁrst quarter .\\nIn conclusion, our ﬁrst quarter results were solid in the context of a volatile\\nenvironment. Our robust ﬁnancial position allowed us to focus on serving our clients\\nand helping them navigate this period of market disruption. Across our leading\\nbusinesses in Global Banking & Markets and Asset & W ealth Management, we\\nremain well positioned to continue to support our clients and execute on our strategic\\npriorities.\\nWith that, we'll now open up the line for questions.\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\nOperator\\nThank you. [Operator Instructions] W e'll take our ﬁrst question from Glenn Schorr\\nwith Evercore.\\nGlenn Schorr\\nHi, there. Curious, you mentioned being optimistic about M&A  in the back-half,\\nparticularly on the strategic side. I'm curious what and how you -- what you're seeing\\nthat gives you that conﬁdence. Obviously it must be conversations. And then what\\nabout the sponsor community? Thanks.\\nDavid Solomon\\nYes. Thanks, Glenn. And so appreciate the question, and you're right. It has to do\\nwith dialogs and things that we can see. I'd say as we came into the new year ,\\nthere's no questions dialogs have picked up. There's no question -- and I always talk\\nabout this when we talk about it broadly , conﬁdence af fects the ability for people to\\nmove forward to be active in the M&A  market and certainly what's gone on over the\\ncourse of the last four weeks has slowed down some of the dialogs.\\nBut when you think about big strategic activity , I think most big companies continue\\nto operate from a position where they're trying to make sure they have the scale and\\nthe strength competitively to advance their strategies. And so those strategic dialogs\\nare quite active. And if you actually look over the course of the last week or two,\\nthere have been a handful of deals that have been announced that highlight that.\\nWe're seeing more dialogs like that and so we're hopeful that more of that will come\\nto fruition. I just think that's a steady part of the diet. The companies need to continue\\nto execute on to improve their strategic position.\\nNow, with respect to ﬁnancial sponsors, we're still going through a reset. I'm\\nencouraged by the fact in the quarter , we saw one or two deals where kind of the bid\\noffer between the value that a ﬁnancial sponsor could achieve and the ﬁnancing\\nprice came to a -- came to meet. There was a good data point and a sell-down of a\\nlegacy deal in the market, but I would say the ﬁnancial sponsor activity is still muted\\nand there is more upside as the reset on both value and ﬁnancing cost continues.\\nI think we're going to get there. I'd expect more in the second half of the year unless\\nthere was a really strong, a much more pronounced economic disruption because it\\njust takes time for people to reset. W e've now kind of gone through ﬁve quarters of\\nreset. And so generally speaking, historically , you kind of see these things turn on\\nafter four to six quarters. So I would just expect more of a base level of activity from\\nwhat's been very , very muted.\\nGlenn Schorr\\nAppreciate that. And building on that, your comment about companies wanting to\\nbuild on their strategic position, maybe we could talk a little bit about your transaction\\nbanking platform because it's still growing. I'm just curious on the March events that\\nwe saw , did it cause any rethinking or maybe encouragement in terms of the\\ndirection of what you're doing with transaction banking and taking on those deposits?\\nAnd did you notice any -- was there any noticeable behavior of how those deposits\\nacted during the March crisis? Thanks.\\nDenis Coleman\\nGlenn, it's Denis. Thanks for the question. I'd say that our conviction around the\\ntransaction banking business remains very , very strong. I think what we were able to\\nobserve in the ﬁrst quarter , I highlighted in my script and it's something that we're\\nfocused on strategically , is, we grew the client count by about 20% in the quarter ,\\nwhich is a similar amount to all of last year . And we're very , very focused on\\ncontinuing to improve our position with our clients, of fer them more and more\\nservices and grow this business steadily over the long-term to create value.\\nI think in terms of how the deposits themselves performed over the course of the\\nquarter , they were in line with our expectations, and as we indicated, they ended on\\na quarter-over-quarter basis up just about $1 billion.\\nOperator\\nThank you. W e'll take our next question from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of\\nAmerica.\\nEbrahim Poonawala\\nHi, good morning. I guess two questions. One, David, you referred to the hyper\\nvolatility in the rates market, but would appreciate if you can address just ﬁxed-\\nincome trading, what happened there this quarter . Clearly there was some lagged\\nperformance versus peers. To the extent you can, just give us a ﬂavor of what\\nhappened and your expectations around how things evolve from here, how are\\nclients' macro funds holding up in face of this volatility .\\nDavid Solomon\\nYes. So I appreciate the question. I mean, it's been interesting -- this morning just\\nwatching what I'd highlight is, I think we had a very solid quarter in FICC. W e had\\nnearly a $4 billion quarter . And just to put that in perspective, I think that's a top-\\ndecile quarter for that. I think we've had -- I think it was the eighth best quarter on\\nrecord. I think we've got 96 quarters. So it was a solid performance and just the\\nheadline number of $4 billion, the way we look at it, that's a very solid FICC quarter .\\nIt was certainly a quarter there was volatility in client activity throughout the quarter ,\\nand I think we were well positioned to serve our clients and served our clients well.\\nNow, some of the noise that I see just from the early morning release, our FICC\\nbusiness was down versus the ﬁrst quarter of last year by 17%, but in the ﬁrst\\nquarter of last year , we had signiﬁcant outperformance. If I remember correctly , our\\nFICC revenues in the ﬁrst quarter of last year were up year-over-year 21% when the\\ncompetitor average was kind of ﬂat or down.\\nAnd you can go look at that from a base perspective. W e had much more signiﬁcant\\noutperformance in the ﬁrst quarter of 2022 because of our commodities business and\\nthe breadth of our commodities business. So if you remember back in the ﬁrst\\nquarter of 2022, the war with Ukraine started, there was more volatility in\\ncommodities and clients were very active in commodities. And so it was an outsized\\nquarter in commodities in the ﬁrst quarter of 2022.\\nBut overall, I think FICC performance in the quarter was strong. W e were there to\\nserve our clients. And by any standards, it was a good quarter . I think given the\\nenvironment that we're operating in, I would expect activity to continue to be active\\nwith our clients. It's certainly an uncertain period of time and there's a lot of\\nmovement and positioning, and so we're ﬁnding our clients active at the moment.\\nEbrahim Poonawala\\nGot it. Thanks for that. And then just separately , I guess, a big focus post Investor\\nDay was picking up pace on asset sales. How does the environment over the last\\nmonth inﬂuence that? Equity markets obviously held up pretty well ex the ﬁnancials.\\nSo given the sense of just asset sale pace of that, how you're thinking about that and\\nany change today versus Investor Day and how does that translate into pace of\\nbuybacks maybe in the back half of the year?\\nDavid Solomon\\nYes. So we commented in the script about the fact that we made more progress on\\nthe disposition of our historical principal investments, and we highlighted that we\\nreduced them from just under $30 billion to just over $27 billion during the quarter .\\nThen it's also highlighted in the script that we feel on track to get to the $15 billion\\ntarget number that we laid out over the course of the next 24 months.\\nWe feel good about that progress and we're going to continue to move to reduce that\\nto zero over time. There are a lot of positions. There's no question when there are\\nmarket headwinds, some of that might go a little bit slower , but we're on pace with\\nwhat we're trying to do and are committed to it. And obviously , we see a big change\\nin that business as we grow management fees and we take the legacy investments\\nout, the volatility in that business, we believe, will change meaningfully .\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Christian Bolu with Autonomous Research.\\nChristian Bolu\\nGood morning, David and Denis. Just to follow up on the question on the Markets\\nbusiness, March did feel like a very tough month for some of your institutional clients,\\nparticularly saw hedge fund closures, we are hearing of deleveraging. So how does\\nthat inform your view of the outlook for the trading businesses and your market\\nshare, particularly given, I guess, Goldman's exposure to the hedge fund\\ncommunity?\\nDavid Solomon\\nSo I appreciate that question. W e're obviously very focused on share and our share\\ngains. W e do participate with the hedge fund community , but when you look at our\\nbig competitors, they participate very actively with the hedge fund community too.\\nWe also are very signiﬁcant with the broad institutional community . As I said just in\\nthe previous question, our clients are active at the moment because there's a lot\\ngoing on. W e're very focused on our market share. As we said in our Investor Day ,\\nwe laid out more metrics and more of a focus on continuing to look at where we can\\nadvance our position with the top 100 clients that we deal with in our markets\\nbusiness. W e continue to be optimistic about our share position, our overall ability to\\nserve our clients, and we do think in this environment, clients will continue to be\\nactive.\\nChristian Bolu\\nGreat. Thank you. And then maybe a question on capital return. Can you just clarify\\nwhy you are slowing buybacks? Your capital ratio is seen very healthy to your point\\nthat the stock is attractive at this level. So not sure that I get it. And then any\\ncomments on your appetite for strategic acquisitions here? There's been a lot of\\nstress in the wealth management space, which is a space I know you guys are\\ninterested in. So curious here, if you're conserving capital to go on the of fense.\\nDenis Coleman\\nSure. Christian, it's Denis. Thank you for the question around capital. And obviously ,\\nin this case, appreciating the starting point in Q1, where we signiﬁcantly increased\\nthe amount of buyback activity in Q1. W e remain very committed to return of capital\\nto shareholders, committed to sustainably growing our dividend, committing to the\\noverall capital return proﬁle, but we're also observing opportunities to deploy into the\\nfranchise on behalf of clients.\\nAnd there are elements of uncertainty in the overall macroeconomic environment.\\nAnd so our expectations is that buyback activity will be moderated, but we'll monitor\\nthat over the course of the quarter . As you say , we do like the stock price and remain\\ncommitted to return of capital to shareholders.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with W olfe Research.\\nSteven Chubak\\nHi, good morning.\\nDavid Solomon\\nGood morning.\\nSteven Chubak\\nSo I wanted to start of f with a question on Platform Solutions. The business saw a\\nstep up in expense. I just wanted to understand how we should be thinking about the\\ntrajectory for expenses in the segment. And similarly , for provision going forward, just\\nfollowing this quarter's signiﬁcant reserve release, we know you had accrued\\nreserves pretty conservatively for that segment, but the top line momentum's good. It\\nwould just be helpful to get some perspective on how we should think about both the\\nexpense as well as the credit trajectory from here.\\nDenis Coleman\\nSure. Thanks. In terms of the overall trajectory for the segment, I think we have to\\nstep back. Our number one focus is driving towards proﬁtability . We also mentioned\\nthat we look to continue to improve the efﬁciency ratio. That's certainly over the\\ncourse of a period of time. Maybe not every given quarter , but we remain committed\\nto what we outlined. As you say , we've seen good top line performance of the\\nbusiness.\\nAnd on the reserve release, it was a function of owning our point-of-sale business for\\nsome period of time, been able to observe it, take in more data. And GreenSky is\\nactually performing better than we had modeled. And so that was a contributor to the\\nreserve release in the segment.\\nAs we think about it on a go-forward basis, it's obviously going to be a function of\\norigination activities across the platform. W e now have a reserve level of roughly\\n13% in the consumer space. So that can give you a sense of how to model\\nprovisions based on forward origination activity .\\nSteven Chubak\\nThat's great, Denis. And just for my follow-up on expense and maybe more like a\\nticky tack modeling question, the expenses were a bit higher than expectations, but I\\nrecall you noted at Investor Day the need to absorb some severance charges. You\\nalso had some pretty outsized impairments related to CIE portfolio. W as hoping you\\ncan maybe help us quantify the level of one-timers in the expense base this quarter\\njust as we think about benchmarking versus some of your longer-term efﬁciency\\ntargets.\\nDenis Coleman\\nThank you. Thank you very much. So let me take that in pieces. In terms of -- on the\\ncompensation expense, any charges associated with severance and some of the\\nactions that we took in the ﬁrst quarter are included within our overall comp accrual,\\nwhich is a 30% -- 33% of our revenues net of provisions. That's embedded inside of\\nthat number .\\nIn terms of the change in non-compensation expenses, they were ﬂat on a quarter-\\nover-quarter basis, but did include, as you know , $355 million of CIE impairments.\\nAnd so we thought it was important to call that out. And that also explains a bunch of\\nthe year-over-year delta between Q1 '22 and Q1 '23. That together with full quarter\\nimpact of NNIP  helps explain the delta in that line for the ﬁrst quarter of this year .\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley .\\nBetsy Graseck\\nHi, good morning.\\nDavid Solomon\\nGood morning.\\nBetsy Graseck\\nSo just a couple of quick questions here. One, on the consumer repositioning that\\nyou talked about today with the Marcus loan sales and with your comments around\\nGreenSky , would you say that as those are done and dusted, that would be it for the\\nconsumer repositioning?\\nDavid Solomon\\nI think, Betsy , what we said clearly is we're narrowing the focus. W e continue to be\\nfocused on our deposit platform and our credit card platform. I do think there are\\nopportunities for us to do other interesting things strategically and how we think\\nabout operating it, but we're going to continue to examine all the things that we can\\ndo to make that as successful as possible. As I just highlighted, we don't think we're\\nnecessarily the best owner of GreenSky . So we're taking action on that, and then\\nwe'll continue to move forward to bring the consumer platform -- the card platforms to\\nproﬁtability .\\nBetsy Graseck\\nAnd so there's some nice capital release that comes from that. How should we\\nanticipate you're going to be utilizing that as we look forward here?\\nDenis Coleman\\nSo as we see the capital release from some of those activities, that just gives us\\nincremental ﬂexibility with respect to how we ultimately deploy that either back in the\\nfranchise and/or returning that capital back to shareholders.\\nOperator\\nThank you. W e'll take our next question from Mike Mayo with W ells Fargo.\\nMike Mayo\\nHi, just a little bit more on the consumer repositioning strategy . How much in the\\nMarcus loans, I think there were $4.5 billion at year-end, did you sell? And what do\\nyou intend to do with the rest?\\nDenis Coleman\\nSo we sold about $1 billion of the Marcus loans and the balance has been moved to\\nheld-for-sale, and so we'll be looking at moving down that position over time.\\nMike Mayo\\nAnd so the marks that you took on these loans, what -- on what -- how much of those\\nmarks were in the $4.5 billion? W as it only a subset or the entire portfolio?\\nDenis Coleman\\nSo we marked the entire -- we sold a portion of the portfolio, and then we marked the\\nbalance to market. And you'll see that reﬂected in the $470 million number moving\\nthrough net revenues. And our reserve release was $440 million. If you think about\\nthe portfolio overall for the quarter , we generated incremental NII, and we had other\\nnet paydowns. So for the whole quarter , we generated revenues north of $150 million\\nand it was proﬁtable for the quarter . As we move forward into the second quarter ,\\nwe'll continue to generate net interest income on that portfolio and move down the\\nbalance of those exposures.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Brennan Hawken with UBS.\\nBrennan Hawken\\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I'd like to follow up ﬁrst on a question\\nthat Glenn asked about the transactional banking. In the past, in conversations, I\\nbelieve that you've indicated that a lot of the competitors are the regional banks\\nthere. So I want to conﬁrm that that's the case. And then given some of the stress\\nthat we've seen and concerns around some of those providers, how are you\\nadjusting your strategy in order to continue to build on the momentum that you seem\\nto have shown here in the ﬁrst quarter? And if we see that continued stress, would\\nyou pursue inorganic venues to add scale or capabilities?\\nDavid Solomon\\nYes. So appreciate the question, Brennan. The -- we think in transaction banking, we\\nhave a very good platform, a very good product. And the feedback that we're getting\\nfrom clients about the product of fering, how it works, what it allows corporate\\ntreasuries and CFOs to do is very positive. It's obviously attractive for us to take\\ndeposits, but we want deposits that are stickier and are here because people are\\noperating on our platform. And so we're working hard to make sure, as we're adding\\nclients, we're bringing the value that attaches the technology to what they're doing in\\na way that grows that platform.\\nWe are seeing positive results, but this takes time. These are long-cycle decisions.\\nThey're not day-to-day decisions on short-term trades. As Denis highlighted, we had\\ngood momentum in terms of customer count where people added themselves to our\\nplatform. And so we're going to continue to focus on that. I do think, given the size\\nand the strength of Goldman Sachs, as a G-SIB and the way we're positioned, we're\\nwell positioned to compete with our clients for this business, coupled with the fact\\nthat we have an excellent product of fering. So we are going to stay focused on that\\nand we expect the business to grow over time.\\nBrennan Hawken\\nGreat. Thanks for that color . Appreciate it. And then for my follow-up, you all just\\nannounced this morning the new deposit arrangement with Apple. And the yield on\\nthat is pretty close to Marcus, a little above. How should we think about the\\neconomics of that Apple relationship and the deposits speciﬁcally? And then how do\\nyou manage potential risk for cannibalization with your own Marcus of fering? Thanks.\\nDavid Solomon\\nSo thank you for the question. So obviously this is something that we launched\\nyesterday that gives us another deposit channel. It's the opportunity for somebody\\nthat's a credit cardholder to put a deposit on. W e've obviously looked very closely at\\nthe overlap between who holds credit cards and who holds -- who has a Marcus\\ndeposit and that overlap is small, but we'll obviously watch closely to see whether or\\nnot there is any cannibalization. But this is a way for us to try to open up another\\ndeposit channel and it's always good for us to broaden our deposit base. And so this\\nis small at the moment and we'll watch it carefully , but I think it's an interesting\\nopportunity for the ﬁrm.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Devin Ryan with JMP  Securities.\\nDevin Ryan\\nGreat. Good morning, David, Denis. I want to just touch on the equity ﬁnancing\\nstrength in the quarter . I know you kind of highlighted spreads and customer activity ,\\nbut also appreciate this is an area of focus for the ﬁrm bigger picture. So just love to\\nthink about kind of where we're jumping of f of into the second quarter and whether\\nthe ﬁrst quarter beneﬁted from the market stress and that maybe you do syncretic\\nthings that happened during the quarter or if this is actually a reasonable kind of\\njumping of f point, and just maybe a better outlook for that business for the rest of the\\nyear.\\nDenis Coleman\\nSure. I appreciate that question. I'll give you some context to help you understand\\nsort of the sequential activity and the direction. So our overall balances were a lot\\nlower into the end of last year based on overall market levels and also as we\\nreduced our footprint. And so as we came into the ﬁrst quarter , we were able to re-\\nexpand the capacity , clients engaged with us. W e saw an increase in balances,\\nincrease in client activities, increase in customer spreads.\\nWe've had in place for some time, a strategy to identify new types of clients that\\ncould come on to the platform and engage with us. And so I'd say that we're working\\nsort of full speed ahead on that. W e continue to be very , very focused on this as one\\nof the key priorities within the Global Banking & Markets business.\\nDevin Ryan\\nOkay . Thanks, Denis. Just a bigger picture follow-up here. So it feels like Goldman\\ngenerally takes market share during periods of stress. And so we just went through a\\npretty extreme period of stress in banking system and maybe we're getting on the\\nother side of it, but perhaps not. And so with Credit Suisse now forcing an acquisition\\nand capital likely becoming tighter in the banking system more broadly , are there\\nnew areas of maybe opportunity for Goldman to take market share just in terms of\\nwhere you're going to lean in with your balance sheet as you've done in the past?\\nHow should we think about maybe a couple of the top areas where you feel like you\\ncan maybe incrementally take market share just as a result of what happened over\\nthe last month or so?\\nDavid Solomon\\nWell, I think our core banking and markets franchise is incredibly well positioned. You\\ncan see the performance this quarter . I certainly wouldn't call it a top quartile for\\ninvestment banking, traditional capital markets, IPOs, M&A  activity . But with a 16.7%\\nROE in our banking and markets segment, I think it's performing well. W e have the\\nbreadth, the footprint, the global franchise, I think, to continue to strengthen our\\nshare. And as I commented a little bit earlier , we continue to be focused on looking at\\nour performance on the top 100, now expand to the top 150 clients and making sure\\nthat we're moving up and capturing share and serving them well.\\nI do think, given some of the things that have gone on, there are other opportunities.\\nI think one of the interesting opportunities is the private wealth opportunity over in\\nEurope. W e see lots of customers that had had accounts at both large Swiss\\ninstitutions with a consolidation. W e're certainly seeing opportunities in our private\\nwealth business as people want to diversify the private wealth relationships we have.\\nAnd so that's an area for share that we're focused on. So we continue to look across\\nboth Global Banking & Markets and also Asset & W ealth Management for\\nopportunities that we can strengthen our position and we think both franchises are\\nvery well positioned.\\nOperator\\nWe'll go next to Dan Fannon with Jef feries.\\nDaniel Fannon\\nThanks. Good morning. W anted to follow up on the third-party fundraising. You had\\nanother great quarter , but certainly highlighted that a bit slow this year , and I guess\\nthat's not surprising given the environment. But could you talk kind of longer term, as\\nyou think about maybe a rebound as the economic conditions pick up? And also, the\\ncycling of your vintages of funds in terms of what could be coming on line this year\\nthat might result in continued strength or some pockets of slowness as you kind of go\\nthrough that cycle?\\nDenis Coleman\\nSo thanks a lot for the question. Obviously , this remains a big area of strategic focus\\nfor us. With $14 billion raised in the ﬁrst quarter and now up to $193 billion, we feel\\nvery good about that. W e indicated that the pace could slow over the balance of the\\nyear, but we do have about 20 of ferings in market on diversiﬁed basis across asset\\nclasses where we're actively looking to raise funds.\\nI think it's really the breadth and the diversity of our franchise that's going to enable\\nus to continue to raise those types of assets. Dif ferent strategies will play towards\\ndifferent types of environments and having the breadth of of fering, I think, is proving\\nto be beneﬁcial. So even though we indicated it may slow later in this year , strong\\nconviction that we'll be on pace for the total amount that we had indicated, just given\\nwhat we see across our platform.\\nDavid Solomon\\nAnd I'd just say , Dan, that one of the things that happens in this business is as you\\nscale and you have the breadth that we have in this business, we set a target for\\n2024, but there is a longer-term goal on target, and there's lots of room for us to grow\\nand continue to expand our footprint and position given the of fering that we have\\nacross the broad alternative spectrum, the global nature of our platform.\\nAnd so this is still -- these are long-dated fundraisings, long-cycle stuf f, but there is a\\nlot of runway for us once we get past the 2024 target too.\\nDaniel Fannon\\nThanks. And then just a follow-up, Denis, on the expense side. The $1 billion of\\nsavings from realization of programs that you highlighted at Investor Day , what was\\nrealized in the ﬁrst quarter? Or maybe just remind us on the pacing of some of those\\nsavings as we think about the range of this year?\\nDenis Coleman\\nSo at Investor Day , we outlined that over the course of the year , we'd have run rate\\npayroll expense of about $600 million and non-comp efﬁciency , about $400 million,\\nand we see about half of that reﬂected in this year and the balance thereafter . I'd say\\nwe're on target for those initiatives and those efﬁciencies. And we continue to look at\\nit, and we continue to see other opportunities to incrementally drive efﬁciency across\\nour platform.\\nOne area we had focused on for quite some time was the overall level of\\nprofessional fees. W e continue to grind that down. And if you look at some of the\\nsequential components of our overall non-compensation expense, you'll see we're\\nmaking good progress against most of the line items.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\\nGerard Cassidy\\nGood morning, David. Good morning, Denis.\\nDavid Solomon\\nGood morning.\\nGerard Cassidy\\nDavid, in your comments about your principal investments, you mentioned obviously\\nmarket conditions will impact how quickly you get to your targeted goal of $15 billion\\nby the end of '24. In those market conditions, is it more the IPO and ECM markets\\nthat have a bigger headwind for you in this area? Or is it just general market levels\\nand the activity we're seeing?\\nDavid Solomon\\nWell, I appreciate the question, Gerard. And I think all these things contribute.\\nFinancing availability contributes on certain assets; IPO market can contribute on\\ncertain assets, and just general valuations contribute on certain assets. I want to put\\nthe comments in perspective because I think that appropriately , we want to make\\nsure people understand obviously that when there is a lot of volatility or there are\\ntough markets, it might slow this down, but we laid out at our Investor Day a plan to\\nmove over the coming few years to close to zero on the historical principal\\ninvestments.\\nWe continue to have a target to get to $15 billion by the end of 2024. W e're conﬁdent\\nthat we're going to execute on that target. So I think the way to think about this is we\\nlaid out a multi-year plan to reduce this down to close to zero and we're moving\\nalong on that target. I wouldn't take the comments that on any quarter-to-quarter\\nbasis, things can slow down. I wouldn't overstate that, but I want people to be aware\\nthat if the market or the environment turns more difﬁcult, that could potentially slow\\nus down. But we're very focused on this, and we're going to continue to work to\\nexecute on a quarter-to-quarter basis.\\nGerard Cassidy\\nVery good. And I know you guys touched on the share repurchases slowing it down a\\nbit and here in the second quarter , you're very well capitalized. If market conditions --\\nI should ask, I guess, how important is it that the ﬁnancial markets need to stabilize\\nfor you guys to maybe get more aggressive in the second half of the year in buying\\nback the stock?\\nDenis Coleman\\nThanks for the question. Look, I think it gets back to how we think about our overall\\ncapital allocation framework, and we're looking at opportunities to deploy against our\\nclient franchise where there could be opportunities for incremental deployment.\\nGiven some of the disruption that we're seeing in markets, we want to remain mindful\\nof that. W e want to remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, and so\\nwe're looking to strike the right balance while being mindful of the overall operating\\nenvironment.\\nDavid Solomon\\nYes. I'd also -- I also just want to highlight, when we spoke at Investor Day , we said\\nclearly that we are focused on accelerating buybacks. That is still in place. Quarter-\\nto-quarter may vary , but that is still in place. And so I just want that also kept in\\nperspective too.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global.\\nJames Mitchell\\nHi, good morning. I think you hinted at improved dialog levels in underwriting to start\\nthe quarter . So can you just give a little more color what you're seeing in the market\\nand maybe how you see the ECM and DCM environment evolving, assuming we\\ndon't have another major step back in the macro?\\nDavid Solomon\\nYes. I think there have been some greenshoots. There were certainly some\\ngreenshoots in February . Levels are still muted. There are obviously a number of\\nthings out there that we'd like to get done, and we're seeing some indication of some\\nsigniﬁcant transactions starting to prepare to get -- to move forward, given markets\\nseem to have settled down a little bit. But I still think we're below trend level.\\nAs I said earlier in the conversation, history tells you that there is plenty of capital\\nraising that needs to get done. Generally speaking, people have to use the capital\\nmarkets to execute on their strategies. But when you have these slowdowns or these\\nwindows close, they typically -- you get that rebalanced after four to six quarters.\\nWe're kind of ﬁve quarters in. And so my expectation or hope is we won't see\\nimprovements from what have been very muted levels, but at this point, we had a\\nvery volatile March, and I'd say things are still slow , but we are starting to see some\\nmore greenshoots again. And we'll just have to watch and see how things unfold in\\nthe quarter and into the back half of the year .\\nJames Mitchell\\nOkay . That's helpful. And then maybe just on FICC ﬁnancing, I know that's been a\\nfocus of growth as well outside of -- equities saw a pretty strong improvement in\\nspreads and volume, but it doesn't look like we saw that in FICC. Anything to think\\nabout on the FICC side, on the ﬁnancing space and how you see that going forward?\\nDenis Coleman\\nSure. Still very , very committed to the FICC ﬁnancing business, which, as we\\nindicated, was up slightly year-over-year . There continue to be good opportunities to\\ndeploy on behalf of clients. I think a lot of the market share progress and client\\nengagement progress that we made over the last couple of years sets us up as one\\nof the go-to calls for the provision of ﬁnancing across the FICC space. So that,\\ncombined with the equity ﬁnancing, remain real priorities for our Global Banking &\\nMarkets business. W e feel good about it.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take our next question from Jeremy Sigee with BNP  Paribas.\\nJeremy Sigee\\nThank you. Good morning. Could I get you to talk a bit more about the Credit Suisse\\nopportunity in wealth management? You mentioned Europe, but could you also talk a\\nbit about Asia and Latin America? Are those regions where you as a ﬁrm have\\nsufﬁcient strength in wealth management to take more share from the Swiss banks\\nsince they are disrupted or is that a bit more marginal for you?\\nDavid Solomon\\nOn the second part of the question, I think when you look at Latin America, it's more\\nmarginal for us, but there is -- we really do have a global footprint, and there are\\nopportunities for us, especially as so many very wealthy individuals deal in dollars\\naround the world. W e also have very , very strong Latin American presence that\\ncomes into our presence in Florida, obviously , where our private wealth business is\\nfocused on Latin America. So there is opportunity there.\\nWe continue to have a broad private wealth footprint in Asia. W e haven't been as\\nfocused on growth and investment in Asia as we have been in Europe over the\\ncourse of the last couple of years. W e did launch a private wealth joint venture over\\nin Asia over the course of the last couple of months with ICBC, which I think is a\\nsmall and slow opportunity , but is an opportunity for us.\\nI think the interesting thing is whenever there is consolidation, as we look at very\\nwealthy individuals that are on our private wealth platform, they tend to have multiple\\nproviders. So whenever there is consolidation, there are opportunities to talk to\\npeople as people then rethink their footprint and the diversiﬁcation of their footprint.\\nAnd so our private wealth teams are very focused on that and the way we serve\\nthose clients.\\nJeremy Sigee\\nThat's very helpful. Thank you.\\nOperator\\nThank you. W e'll take our next question from Andrew Lim with Societe Generale.\\nAndrew Lim\\nHi, good morning. So my ﬁrst question is about your focus on credit cards on the\\nconsumer side. Perhaps you can talk more speciﬁcally about what you see as your\\ncompetitive advantages there and how you think about sizing up in credit cards in\\nthis point of the cycle. It's perhaps arguably quite late and some would argue that\\ncredit card growth tends to be a reﬂection of individuals not being able to manage\\nexpenses in a high inﬂationary environment.\\nDenis Coleman\\nSure. Thanks. So as you know , we have our card platform business. W e've been\\nbuilding that over the next -- over the last several years. W e have partnership with\\nGeneral Motors, a partnership with Apple, and we've been steadily investing in those\\nrelationships and building our balances.\\nAs you indicate, given the overall environment, the total balances actually were down\\nsequentially , just given seasonality and given some of our credit underwriting\\nstandards and origination volumes, but this is a business that we continue to invest\\nin and believe it's an overall piece of the ﬁrm that is diversifying.\\nAndrew Lim\\nGreat. Okay . I've got a second question more broadly about the crisis that we saw in\\nMarch and how you think about how it evolved and maybe the repo situation as well.\\nSo if we think about the SVB situation, obviously , they decided to sell a lot of their\\nassets below market value, and in the process, crystallizing a lot of those losses. And\\nI guess in retrospect, it would have been a lot easier for them to repo those assets\\nwith the Fed and avoid those mark-to-market losses. And I was just wondering if you\\ncould share your thoughts as to maybe why that didn't happen. It would have been\\nobviously to af ford a lot of the crisis conﬁdence advice from that situation.\\nDavid Solomon\\nI don't really have a -- I don't have a comment on that, Andrew . There are a variety of\\nfactors in the actions that they took. Ultimately , there was a bank run at SVB and that\\nled to the situation we are. But I don't -- I'm not going to go back and recount what\\ndecisions that management and that board made around that.\\nOperator\\nThank you. W e'll take a follow-up from Mike Mayo with W ells Fargo.\\nMike Mayo\\nHi. First, Goldman speciﬁc and then general. The Goldman speciﬁc is why now on\\nthe consumer repositioning, GreenSky sale and Marcus loans? And then a more\\ngeneral question. To what degree did Silicon V alley impact the capital markets and\\nthe advisory appetite out there? Thanks.\\nDavid Solomon\\nYes. Thanks, Mike. So ﬁrst, why now , it's actually not why now . It's like -- it's why over\\nthe last 12 months is, as you know , we made a strategic decision kind of 12 months\\nago at this point to really narrow our consumer focus, and we've been executing on\\nit. And it's not narrowing that focus and making those decisions and executing on it\\nare not things that can be done instantaneously . So we've gone through a very , very\\nthoughtful process and we're moving forward in the execution of that.\\nAgain, I think these things also are just not like they're small in the overall scope of\\nGoldman Sachs. The Marcus loan portfolio was proﬁtable but small, wasn't strategic.\\nGreenSky , as we highlighted today , we think it's a good business, good platform, and\\nactually , as we watch it perform, it's performing well. But given the way we've\\nnarrowed our focus, not strategic for us. And so we're simply executing on the\\ndecisions that we laid out and we'll continue to do things that we think are right over\\ntime to deliver for our shareholders.\\nOn the second question, which is just what happened in March, how did it af fect\\ncapital markets and M&A, I think it has a ef fect. It was a highly -- as I highlighted in\\nmy comments, this kind of an unusual few-week period with really , really outsized\\nvolatility , and as you and I discussed before, whenever you have that kind of\\nvolatility , it slows down capital markets activity .\\nSo I thought we were starting to get a little bit more capital markets activity at the end\\nof February . I noticed now equity markets seem to be behaving well, debt markets\\nare behaving reasonably well. I can't say that there won't be some other event that\\ncreates stress. There certainly are other things on the horizon that you could see that\\ncould create volatility like the negotiation around the debt ceiling, just to point to an\\nexample, but I do think when you have that kind of volatility , it slows down or it has\\npeople push out things that they were thinking about bringing into the capital\\nmarkets.\\nSo yes, [technical difﬁculty] quarter . It was certainly a pretty muted quarter for\\ninvestment banking activity for us and for the market as a whole.\\nOperator\\nWe'll take a follow-up from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\\nEbrahim Poonawala\\nThank you. Just one quick question, Denis, maybe. Around the Apple savings\\ndeposit, how do you intend to use the funds that come in? I appreciate early days in\\nterms of the level of inﬂows that you may get on that product, but is that money just\\ngoing to sit in cash earning Fed funds? Just trying to ﬁgure out what the NII revenue\\nimpact could be tied to those deposits.\\nDavid Solomon\\nSure. Thanks. Thanks, Ebrahim. So across the ﬁrm, we have multiple funding\\nchannels, multiple sources that we tap in our BAU activities. W e have multiple\\ndeposit channels that we also actively work with each and every day . We view this as\\none incremental and diversifying source of deposits, enables us to deepen our\\nrelationship with Apple, tap into their ecosystem and the clients that we serve\\ntogether who are cardholders and want to sort of take advantage of the ease of\\nmoving into a deposit account. And we'll take those deposits along with all the other\\ndeposits in our portfolio and deploy it into the client franchise.\\nOperator\\nThat will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn it back over to our\\nspeakers for any additional or closing remarks.\\nCarey Halio\\nYes. Thank you all for calling. W e appreciate the time and interest in the ﬁrm. And if\\nyou have any additional questions, certainly feel free to call me or the rest of the\\nInvestor Relations team. Otherwise, we look forward to speaking with you soon.\\nThank you.\\nOperator\\nLadies and gentlemen, this concludes the Goldman Sachs ﬁrst quarter 2023\\nearnings conference call. Thank you for participation. You may now disconnect.\\nRead more current GS analysis and news\\nView all  earnings call transcripts\""
