The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer on the b ack.\\nStarting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $12.6 billion, EPS o f $4.10 on revenue of $39.3 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 23%.\\nThese results included $868 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate.\\nBefore reviewing our results for the quarter, let's talk about the recent bank failures. Jamie has add ressed a number of the important themes in\\nhis shareholder letter and a recent televised interview so I will go straight to the specific impacts on the firm.\\nAs you would expect, we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and m oney market fund inflows, most\\nsignificantly in the Commercial Bank, Business Banking and AWM. Regarding the deposit inflows, at the Firmwide level, average  deposits\\nwere down 3% quarter -on-quarter while end -of-period deposits were up 2% quarter -on-quarter  \\u2013 implying an intra -quarter reversal of the\\nrecent outflow trend as a consequence of the March events. We estimate that we have retained approximately $50 billion of the se deposit\\ninflows at quarter -end.\\nIt's important to note that while the sequential p eriod -end deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected, our current full\\nyear NII outlook \\u2013 which I will address at the end \\u2013 still assumes modest deposit outflows from here. We expect these outflows to be driven by\\nthe same factors as last quarter, as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarter's inflows.\\nNow back to the quarter, touching on a few highlights. We grew our IB fee wallet share, consumer spending remains solid with combined debit\\nand credit card spe nd up 10% year -on-year, and credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company.\\nOn page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up $7.7 billion or 25% year -on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $9.2 billion\\nor 78%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was down $1.1 billion or 10%, dri ven by the\\nsecurities losses previously mentioned as well as lower IB fees and lower auto lease income on lower volume, and Market s revenue was\\ndown $371 million or 4% year -on-year.\\nExpenses of $20.1 billion were up $916 million or 5% year -on-year, driven by compensation -related costs reflecting the annualization of last\\nyear's headcount growth and wage inflation. These results inc lude the impact of the higher FDIC assessment I mentioned last quarter which,\\nof course, is unrelated to recent events. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge -offs of $1.1 billion, predominantly in Card. The net\\nreserve build of $1.1 billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weighted -average economic outlook.\\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, up about 60 basis points, which w as primarily\\ndriven by the benefit of net income les s distributions and AOCI gains. And in line with what we previously said, we resumed stock buybacks\\nthis quarter and distributed a total of $1.9 billion in net repurchases back to shareholders.\\nNow, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 4. Touching quickly on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based\\non our data. Both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization, as expected, but we continue to monito r their activity\\nclosely. Spend remains solid and we ha ve not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter.\\nMoving to financial results, CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion, on revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35% year -on-year. In Banking\\nand Wealth Management, revenue was up 67% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Average deposits were down 2% quarter -\\non-quarter, in line with recent trends. Throughout the quarter, we continued to see customer flows to higher yielding products a s you would\\nexpect, but we're encouraged by what we are capturing in CDs and our wealth management offerings. Client investment assets were down\\n1% year -on-year, but up 7% quarter -on-quarter, driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was\\ndown 38% year -on-year, l argely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue.\\nMoving to Card Services and Auto \\u2013 revenue was up 14% year -on-year, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving\\nbalances, partially offset  by lower Auto lease income. Credit card spend was up 13% year -on-year. Card outstandings were up 21%, driven by\\nstrong new account growth and revolve normalization. And in Auto, originations were $9.2 billion, up 10% year -on-year. Expenses of $8.1\\nbillion  were up 5% year -on-year reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher headcount. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit\\ncosts were $1.4 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $300 million in Card and $50 million in Home Lending. Net charg e-offs were $1.1 billion, up\\nabout $500 million year -on-year, in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios.\\nNext, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment  Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was\\ndown 24% year -on-year. IB fees were down 19%. We ranked number one with first quarter wallet share of 8.7%. In advisory, fees were down\\n6% compared to a strong first quarter last year. Our underwriting businesses contin ued to be affected by market conditions with fees down\\n34% for debt and 6% for equity.\\nIn terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same: our pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is sensitive to mark et conditions and\\nthe economic outlook. We expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging.\\nMoving to Markets, total revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4% year -on-year. Fixed Income was flat. Rates was strong during the rally early in the\\nquarter, as well as throug h the elevated volatility in March. Credit was up on the back of higher client flows and Currencies & Emerging\\nMarkets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in  the prior year. Equity Markets was down 12%, driven by lower revenues in\\nderivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity in Cash.\\nPayments revenue was $2.4 billion, up 26% year -on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, primarily a gain in the prior year, it\\nwas up 55%, with the gro wth driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was\\nup 7% year -on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels. Expenses of $7.5 billion were up 2%\\nyear-on-year as higher headcount and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenue -related compensation.\\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 46%\\nyear-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 98% year -on-year driven by higher rates, and gross\\nInvestment Banking revenue of $881 million was up 21% year -on-year on increased M&A and bond underwriting from large deal act ivity.\\nExpenses of $1.3 billion were up 16% year -on-year, largely driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and\\ntechnology investments, as well as higher volume -related expense. Average deposits were down 16% year -on-year and 5%  quarter -on-\\nquarter, predominantly driven by continued attrition in non -operating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances.\\nLoans were up 13% year -on-year and 1% sequentially. C&I loans were up 1% quarter -on-quarter, with somewhat different dynamics based on\\nclient size. In Middle Market Banking, higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization, wh ich is also\\nleading to weakness in capex spending.\\nIn Corporate Client Banking, utilization rates increased modestly quar ter-on-quarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for\\nbank debt. CRE loans were also up 1% sequentially, with higher rates creating headwinds from both originations and prepayment s. And given\\nthe recent focus on commercial real estate, le t me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused\\nin urban dense markets; and nearly two -thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply constrained markets. Finally, credit costs of\\n$417 million incl uded a net reserve build of $379 million predominantly driven by what I mentioned upfront.\\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre -tax margin\\nof 35%. Revenue of $4.8 bil lion was up 11% year -on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our\\ninitial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our Asset Management Joint Venture in China, partially offset by the  impact of lower\\navera ge market levels on management fees and lower performance fees. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 8% year -on-year, predominantly\\ndriven by compensation, reflecting growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue -related compensation and the run -rate impact\\nof acquisitions.\\nFor the quarter, net long -term inflows were $47 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $93 billion,\\ninclusive of our ongoing deposit migration. AUM of $3 trillion was up 2% year -on-year and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion were up 6%\\ndriven by continued net inflows into liquidity and long -term products. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter -on-quarter, driven by lower\\nsecurities -based lending, while average deposits were down 5%.\\nTurning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $244 million. Revenue was $985 million compared to a net los s of $881\\nmillion last year. NII was $1.7 billion, up $2.3 billion year -on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $755 million compared\\nwith a loss of $345 million in the prior year, and  included the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier. Expenses of $160 million\\nwere down $24 million year -on-year. And credit costs of $370 million were driven by  reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures.\\nNext, the Outlook on page 9. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $81 billion. This increase in gui dance is\\nprimarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consume r and wholesale in light of the expectation of Fed cuts later in the year, as\\nwell as slightly higher card revolving balances. Note that in line with my comments at the outset, recent deposit balance inc reases are not a\\nmeaningful contributor to the upward  revision in the NII outlook given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later\\nin the year.\\nI would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags: we think a more sustainable NII ex. Markets run -rate in t he medium -term\\nis well below this quarter's $84 billion, as well as below the $80 billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our fu ll year guidance; and\\nwhile we don't know exactly when this lower run -rate will be reached, when it happens, we beli eve it will be around the mid -70s.\\nAnd, of course, as we mentioned last quarter, this NII outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with th e timing and the\\nextent of deposit reprice, investment portfolio decisions, the dynamics of QT and RRP, the trajectory of Fed funds, as well as the broader\\nmacroeconomic environment \\u2013 including its impact on loan growth. Separately, it's worth noting that Markets NII may start to trend slightly\\npositive towards the end of the year as a function of m ix and rate effects.\\nMoving to expenses, our outlook for 2023 continues to be about $81 billion. Importantly, this does not currently include the impact of the\\npending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 2.6%.\\nSo to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise. We have  benefited from our\\nfortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment.\\nWith that \\u2013 operator please open the line for Q&A.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 22,\n        \"max\": 25,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          23\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 2,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.\\nStarting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $8.3 billion, EPS of $2.63, on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 16%.\\nThese results include approximately $900 million of credit reserve builds, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, as well a s $500 million of\\nlosses in credit adjustmen ts and other in CIB.\\nRegarding loan growth, we're continuing to see positive trends with loans up 8% year -on-year and 1% quarter -on-quarter ex PPP with the\\nsequential growth driven by continued pick -up in demand in our wholesale businesses, including ongo ing strength in AWM.\\nOn page 2, we have some more detail on our results. Revenue of $31.6 billion was down $1.5 billion or 5% year on year. NII ex  Markets was\\nup $1 billion or 9% on balance sheet growth and higher rates, partially offset by lower NII from  PPP loans. NIR ex Markets was down $2.2\\nbillion or 17% predominantly driven by lower IB fees, lower home lending production revenue, losses in credit adjustments and  other in CIB as\\nwell as investment securities losses in corporate. And markets revenue wa s down $300 million or 3% against a record first quarter last year.\\nExpenses of $19.2 billion were up approximately $500 million or 2%, predominantly on higher investments and structural expens es, largely\\noffset by lower volume and revenue related expense s. Credit costs were $1.5 billion for the quarter. We built $902 million in reserves driven by\\nincreasing the probability of downside risks due to high inflation and the war in Ukraine, as well as builds for Russia -associated exposures in\\nCIB and AWM. Net charge -offs of $582 million were down year -on-year and comparable to last quarter and remain historically low across our\\nportfolios.\\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3. Our CET1 ratio ended at 11.9%, down 120 basis points from the prior quarter. As  a reminder, we\\nexited the fourth quarter with an elevated buffer to absorb anticipated changes this quarter, the largest being SA -CCR adoption as well as\\nsome pick -up in seasonal activity. In addition to those anticipated items, there were a couple of oth er drivers. The rate selloff led to AOCI\\ndrawdowns in our AFS portfolio, but keep in mind, all else equal, these mark -to-market losses accrete back to capital through time and as\\nsecurities mature.\\nAnd price increases across commodities resulted in higher  counterparty credit and market risk RWA. While, of course, the environment is\\nuncertain, many of these effects are now in the rearview mirror. And as a result, we believe that our current capital and fut ure earnings profile\\nposition us well to continue su pporting business growth, while meeting increasing capital requirements as we look ahead.\\nWith that, let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page 4. CCB reported net income of $2.9 billion on\\nrevenue of $12.2 billion, whi ch was down 2% year -on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 8%, predominantly driven by\\ngrowth in deposit balances and client investment assets, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Deposits were up 18%  year-on-year\\nand 4% quarte r-on-quarter, consistent with last quarter. And client investment assets were up 9% year -on-year, largely driven by flows in\\naddition to market performance.\\nIn Home Lending, revenue was down 20% year -on-year, on lower production revenue from both lower ma rgins and volumes against a very\\nstrong quarter last year, largely offset by higher net servicing revenue. Originations of $24.7 billion declined 37% with the  rise in rates, and as\\na result, mortgage loans were down 3%.\\nMoving to Card & Auto, revenue was down 8% year -on-year, primarily on strong new card account originations leading to higher acquisition\\ncosts. Card outstandings were up 11%, and revolving balances have continued to grow, ending the quarter above the first quart er of 2021\\nlevels. And in Aut o, originations were $8.4 billion, down 25% due to the lack of vehicle supply, while loans were up 3%.\\nTouching on consumer spend, combined credit and debit spend was up 21% year -on-year, with growth stronger in Credit as we see a\\ncontinued pickup in trav el and dining. And as the quarter progressed, we saw a robust reacceleration of T&E spend, up 64%. Expenses of\\n$7.7 billion were up 7% year -on-year, driven by higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume - and revenue -\\nrelated  expenses.\\nNext, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.5 billion for the first quarter. Investmen t Banking revenue\\nof $2.1 billion was down 28% versus the prior year. IB fees were down 31% year -on-year. We maintained  our number one rank with a wallet\\nshare of 8%. In advisory, fees were up 18%, and it was the best first quarter ever, benefiting from the closing of deals anno unced in 2021.\\nDebt underwriting fees were down 20%, primarily driven by leveraged finance as i ssuers contended with market volatility. And in equity\\nunderwriting, fees were down 76% on lower issuance activity, particularly in North America and EMEA.\\nMoving to Markets, total revenue was $8.8 billion, down 3% against a record first quarter last year. Fixed income was relatively flat, driven by a\\ndecline in securitized products, where rising rates have slowed down the pace of mortgage production, largely offset by growt h in currencies\\nand emerging markets and commodities on elevated client activit y in a volatile market. Equity Markets were down 7% against an all -time\\nrecord quarter last year. This quarter, however, was our second best, with robust client activity across both derivatives and  cash. And Prime\\ncontinued to perform well, with client bal ances hovering around all -time highs.\\nCredit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $524 million, driven by funding spread widening as well as credit valuation adjustme nts relating to\\nboth increases in commodities exposures and markdowns of derivatives receiva bles from Russia -associated counter parties.\\nLet me take a second here to address the widely reported situation in the nickel market as it relates to our results this qua rter. We were\\nhedging positions for clients closely linked to nickel producers, who g enerally sell forward a portion of the coming year's production. The\\nextreme price movements created margin calls, which we and other banks are helping to address. Because this is counterparty r elated, not\\ntrading, it appears in the Credit Adjustments & Ot her line, where it contributed about $120 million to the reported loss I just mentioned. It also\\ndrove approximately half of the increase in market risk RWA that I noted on the capital slide, and was a driver of higher rep orted VaR, which\\nwill also be elev ated in our upcoming filings.\\nPayments revenue was $1.9 billion, up 33% year -on-year, or up 9% excluding net gains on equity investments driven by continued growth in\\nfees, deposit balances and higher rates.\\nSecurities Services revenue of $1.1 billion wa s up 2% year -on-year driven by higher rates and growth in fees. Expenses of $7.3 billion were up\\n3% year -on-year mostly due to higher structural expenses and investments largely offset by lower volume - and revenue -related expenses.\\nMoving to Commercial Ba nking on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $850 million, and an ROE of 13%. Revenue of $2.4\\nbillion was flat year -on-year with higher payments revenue and deposit balances offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross\\nInvestment Banking  revenue of $729 million was down 35%, driven by both fewer large deals and less flow activity.\\nExpenses of $1.1 billion were up 17% year -on-year largely driven by investments and volume - and revenue -related expenses. Deposits were\\ndown 2% quarter -on-quarter, as client balances are seasonally highest at year -end.\\nLoans were up 5% year -on-year and up 3% quarter -on-quarter excluding PPP. C&I loans were up 3% sequentially ex PPP, reflecting higher\\nrevolver utilization and originations across middle market an d corporate client banking. CRE loans were up 3% driven by strong loan\\noriginations and funding across the portfolio.\\nAnd then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with a  pre-tax\\nmargin of 30%. Revenue of $4.3 billion was up 6% year -on-year, as growth in deposits and loans and higher management fees and\\nperformance fees in alternative investments were partially offset by deposit margin compression and the absence of investment  valuati on\\ngains from the prior year.\\nExpenses of $2.9 billion were up 11% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments as well as higher\\nvolume and revenue related expenses. For the quarter, net long -term inflows of $19 billio n were positive across all channels with strength in\\nequities, multi -asset and alternatives, and in liquidity, we saw net outflows of $52 billion.\\nAUM of $3 trillion and overall client assets of $4.1 trillion, up 4% and 8% year -on-year respectively, were driven by strong net inflows. And\\nfinally, loans were up 3% quarter -on-quarter with continued strength in mortgages and securities -based lending, while deposits were up 9%.\\nTurning to Corporate on page 8, Corporate reported a net loss of $856 million. Rev enue was a loss of $881 million, down $408 million year -\\non-year. NII was up $319 million due to the impact of higher rates, and NIR was down $727 million due to losses on legacy equity  investments\\nversus gains last year, as well as approximately $400 milli on of net realized losses on investment securities this quarter. Expenses of $184\\nmillion were lower by $692 million year -on-year, primarily due to the contribution to the firm's foundation in the prior year.\\nNext, the outlook on page 9. We still expect N II ex Markets to be in excess of $53 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $77\\nbillion. And we'll update these and give you more color at Investor Day next month.\\nSo to wrap up, once again this quarter the company's performance was strong in a  particularly volatile and challenging environment. We\\nhelped our clients navigate very difficult markets, provided support to relief efforts and implemented economic sanctions of unprecedented\\ncomplexity with multiple directives from governments around th e world. And, of course, our thoughts remain with everyone, including our\\nemployees, affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\\nLooking ahead, the US economy remains robust, but we're watching high inflation, the reversal of QE and rising rates, as well  as the ongoing\\neffects of the war on the global economy.\\nWith that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\",\n          \"Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our webs ite, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.\\nStarting on page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.6 billion, EPS of $2.76 on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 17%.\\nTouching on a few highlights, we had another quarter of strong performance in markets, which generated revenue of nearly $8 billion. Credit is\\nstill quite healthy, and net charge- offs remain historically low. And there continue to be positive trends in loan growth across our businesses,\\nwith average loans up 7% year -on-year and 2% quarter -on-quarter.\\nOn page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $31.6 billion was up $235 million or 1% year -on-year. NII ex markets was up $2.8 billion or\\n26%, driven by higher rates and balance sheet growth. NIR ex markets was down $3.6 billion or 26%, largely driven by lower IB fees and\\nhigher card acquisition costs. And markets revenue was up $1 billion or 15% year -on-year.\\nExpenses of $18.7 billion were up $1.1 billion or 6% year -on-year, predominantly on higher investments and struc tural expenses, partially\\noffset by lower volume-  and revenue- related expenses. And credit costs were $1.1 billion, which included net charge- offs of $657 million and\\nreserve builds of $428 million, reflecting loan growth as well as a modest deterioration in the economic outlook.\\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3. Let's start by talking about our plans for capital managem ent over the coming quarters. The new\\n4% SCB will raise our standardized CET1 requirement to 12% effective in the fourth quarter,  and the 4% GSIB effective in 1Q 2023 further\\nraises this requirement to 12.5%. At Investor Day, we said that we expected SCB t o be higher and made it clear that in the near -term, share\\nbuybacks would be significantly reduced in order to build capital for the increased requirements. In light of the SCB coming in even higher than\\nexpected, we have paused buybacks for the near -term.\\nAs we discussed at Investor Day and as we show at the bottom of this presentation page, our organic capital generation allows  us to rapidly\\nbuild capital in excess of future requirements, with a current target of roughly 12.5% in the fourth quarter. Any excess  over the regulatory\\nrequirements offers us protection against a range of economic scenarios with room to deploy capital in  line with our strategic priorities. We\\nhave a long- established track record of balance sheet discipline across the company, and this quarter's RWA reduction shows evidence of this\\ndiscipline.\\nTurning to this quarter's results, you can see that our CET1 r atio of 12.2% is up 30 basis points from the prior quarter. Our RWA was down\\napproximately $44 billion with growth in franchise lending being more than offset by the combination of active balance sheet management and\\nthe normalization of market risk RWA fr om the first quarter. CET1 capital was slightly down as earnings were offset by distributions and the\\nimpact of AOCI drawdowns in our AFS portfolio.\\nNow, let's go to our businesses starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page 4. Before I review CCB' s performance, let me touch on\\nwhat we're seeing in our data regarding the health of the US consumer. Spend is still healthy wi th combined debit and credit spend up 15%\\nyear-on-year. We see the impact of inflation and higher nondiscretionary spend across i ncome segments. Notably, the average consumer is\\nspending 35% more year -on-year on gas and approximately 6% more on recurring bills and other nondiscretionary categories.\\nAt the same time, we have yet to observe a pullback in discretionary spending including in the lower income segments with travel and dining growing a robust 34% year -on-year overall. And with spending growing faster than incomes, median deposit balances are down across\\nincome segments for the first time since the pandemic started though c ash buffers still remain elevated.\\nWith that as a backdrop, this quarter, CCB reported net income of $3.1 billion on revenue of $12.6 billion which was down 1% year -on-year. In\\nConsumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 9% year -on-year driven by growth i n deposits. Deposits were up 13% year -on-year and 2%\\nquarter -on-quarter, and client investment assets were down 7% year -on-year driven by market performance partially offset by flows.\\nHome Lending revenue was down 26% year -on-year, as the rate environment  drove both lower production revenue and tighter spreads,\\npartially offset by higher net servicing revenue and mortgage origination volume of $22 billion was down 45%.\\nMoving to Card & Auto , revenue was down 6% year -on-year reflecting higher acquisition c osts on strong new card account originations and\\nlower auto lease income largely offset by higher card NII. Card outstandings were up 16%, and revolving balances were up 9%. And in auto, originations were $7 billion down 44% from record levels a year ago due to continued lack of vehicle supply and rising rates while loans were up 2%. Expenses of $7.7 billion were up 9% year -on-year driven by higher investments of structural expenses partially offset by lower volume-\\nand revenue- related expenses.\\nIn terms of actual credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $761 million reflecting net charge- offs of $611 million, dow n $121 million\\nyear-on-year driven by C ard and a reserve build of $150 million in C ard driven by loan growth.\\nNext, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $3.7 billion on revenue of $11.9 billion. There were a number of notable items this\\nquarter, including net markdowns on certain equity investments of approximately $370 million, with about $345 million reflected in pay ments\\nand m arkdowns on the bridge book of approximately $250 million in IB revenue.\\nInvestment Banking revenue of $1.4 billion was  down 61% year -on-year or down 53% excluding the bridge book markdowns. IB fees were\\ndown 54% versus an all -time record quarter last year. We maintained our number -one rank with a year -to-date wallet share of 8.1%. In\\nAdvisory, fees were down 28% reflecting a decline in announced activity which started in the first quarter. The volatile market resulted in\\nmuted issuance in our underwriting businesses.\\nUnderwriting fees were down 53% for debt and down 77% for equity. In terms of outlook, while our existing pipeline remains healthy,\\nconversion of the deal backlog may be challenging if the current headwinds continue. Lending revenue of $410 m illion was up 79% versus the\\nprior year driven by gains on mark -to-market hedges as  well as higher loan balances.\\nMoving to Markets , total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 15% year -on-year in both Fixed Income and E quities against a strong quarter last year.\\nIn Fixed Income, elevated volatility drove both increased client flows and robust t rading results in the macro franchise, most notably in\\ncurrencies and emerging markets. This was partially offset by credit and securitized products in a challenging spread environment. In E quity\\nMarkets, we had a strong second quarter and again increased volatility produced a strong performance in derivatives. Credit Adjustments &\\nOther was a loss of $218 million largely driven by funding spread widening.\\nPayments revenue w as $1.5 billion, up 1% year -on-year or up 25% excluding the markdowns on equity inv estments. The year -on-year growth\\nwas primarily driven by higher rates. Security Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year -on-year with growth in fees and higher rates\\nmore than offsetting the impact of lower market levels. Expenses of $6.7 billion w ere up 3% year -on-year predominantly driven by higher\\nstructural expenses and investments, largely offset by lower revenue- related compensation.\\nMoving to Commercial Banking on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1 billion. Revenue of $2.7 billion was up 8% year -on-\\nyear driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower I nvestment Banking revenue. Gross I nvestment Banking revenue of $788\\nmillion was d own 32% driven by lower debt and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of $1.2 bil lion were up 18% year -on-year predominantly\\ndriven by higher structural and volume-  and revenue- related expenses. Deposits were down 5% quarter -on-quarter driven by migration of non-\\noperating deposits in to higher yielding alternatives which we expect to continue given the current rate environment.\\nLoans were up 4% sequentially. C&I loans were up 6% reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across middle mar ket and\\ncorporate client banking. CRE loans were up 3% driven by strong loan originations and funding in commercial term lending and real estate\\nbanking. Finally, credit costs of $209 million were largely driven by loan growth while net charge- offs remain hist orically low.\\nThen to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with pre- tax margin of\\n31%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.3 billion was up 5% year -on-year driven by growth in deposits and l oans as well as higher margins,\\npartially offset by investment valuation losses ver sus gains in the prior year. In addition, reductions in management fees linked to this year's\\nmarket declines have been almost entirely offset by the removal of most money m arket fund fee waivers. Expenses of $2.9 billion were up\\n13% year -on-year, largely driven by investments in our private banking advisory teams, technology and asset management, as well as higher\\nvolume-  and revenue- related expenses.\\nFor the quarter, net l ong-term inflows of $6 billion were driven by equities. AUM of $2.7 trillion and ov erall client assets of $3.8 trillion down 8%\\nand 6% year -on-year respectively were predominantly driven by lower market levels partially offset by net long- term inflows. Finally, loans\\nwere up 1% quarter -on-quarter while deposits were down 7% sequentially driven by seasonal client tax payments.\\nTurning to C orporate on page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $174 million. Revenue was $80 million versus a loss in the prior year. NII\\nwas $324 million, up $1.3 billion predominantly due to the impact of higher rates, and expenses of $206 million were lower by $309 million\\nyear-on-year.\\nNext, the outlook on page 9. You w ill recall that at Investor Day, we expected NII ex markets for 2022 to be in excess of $56 billion. We now\\nexpect it to be in excess of $58 billion reflecting Fed funds reaching 3.5% by year -end. We still expect adjusted expense to be approximately\\n$77 billion and the C ard net charge- off rate to be less than 2% for 2022.\\nSo to wrap up, the company's performance was strong again this quart er in what was a complex operating environment. As we look forward,\\nwe are mindful of the elevated uncertainty in the global economy, but we feel confident that we are prepared and well -positioned for a broad\\nrange of outcomes.\\nWith that, operator, please open up the line for Q&A.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 22,\n        \"max\": 25,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          23,\n          25\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2,\n          4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Erika, that's a good question. And I understand what you're asking \\u2013 why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit\\nunsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision -making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors.\\nBut, all the ingredients that you've listed are the r ight ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the\\nfinalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always\\nat the bottom of the hie rarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities.\\nSo, I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with the modest pace for now. But obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to\\nadjust that whenever we want under the  current regime, and we may well do that .\",\n          \"Yeah. Thanks, John. And I'd love to have a very long conversation with you about this, but I'm going to keep it short here. I t's really all about\\nlags. So, as our disclosure says, we do not include the impact of reprice lags in our EaR calculation. So, as a result of that, the entire\\ncalculation is based on modeled rates paid in the terminal state.\\nAs you well know, right now, we're in the middle of some very significant lags, which are affecting the numbers quite a bit a nd which we expect\\nto persist for s ome time. So, as a result of that, what I would expect in the near term is something quite similar to what we've experienced this\\nyear. As you know, this year, as rates have gone up, we've revised our NII outlook from $50 billion at the beginning of the y ear to now $61.5\\nbillion. So, as we look forward in the near term from here, I would expect similar type sensitivities to rate fluctuations, g iven the lag\\nenvironment that we're in.\",\n          \"Yeah. So, good question on the multi -family, and the short answer is that, for us, it's pretty uncontroversially  no \\u2013 no bleed -through. And the\\nreason is that while we are aware of some of the pressure on multi -family, that's in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually\\nbig in. So, it's higher -end stuff in much less supply constrained markets that is under more pres sure. And as you know, our multi -family\\nportfolio is much more affordable, supply constrained markets. And so, the performance there remains really very robust .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
