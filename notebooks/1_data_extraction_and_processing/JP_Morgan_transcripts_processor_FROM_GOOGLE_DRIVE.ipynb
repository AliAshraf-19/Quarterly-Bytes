Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer in  the back.\\nStarting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $14.5 billion, EPS of $4.75 on revenue of $42.4 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 25%.\\nThese results included the First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, a credit reserve build for the First Republi c lending portfolio of\\n$1.2 billion as well as $900 millio n of net investment securities losses in Corporate. Touching on a few highlights: CCB client investment\\nassets were up 18% year -on-year, we had record long -term inflows in AWM, and we ranked number one in IB fee wallet share.\\nBefore giving you more detail  on the financials, let me give you a brief update on the status of the First Republic integration on page 2. The\\nsettlement process with the FDIC is on schedule with a number of key milestones being recently completed. Systems integration  is also\\nproceedi ng apace and we are targeting being substantially complete by mid -2024. First Republic employees have formally joined us as of July\\n2nd and we're pleased to have had very high acceptance rates on our offers. And although it's still early days, as we get th e sales force back in\\nthe market we are happy to see that client retention is strong with about $6 billion of net deposit inflows since the acquisi tion.\\nNow turning back to this quarter's results on page 3. You'll see that in various parts of the presenta tion, we have specifically called out the\\nimpact of First Republic where relevant. To make things easier, I'm going to start by discussing the overall impact of First Republic on this\\nquarter's results at the Firmwide level. Then, for the rest of the prese ntation, I will generally exclude the impact of First Republic in order to\\nimprove comparability with prior periods. With that in mind, in this quarter First Republic contributed $4 billion of revenue , $599 million of\\nexpense, and $2.4 billion of net incom e. As noted on the first page, this includes $2.7 billion of bargain purchase gain which is reflected in NIR\\nin the Corporate segment, as well as $1.2 billion of allowance build. And remember that the deal happened on May 1st, so the First Republic\\nnumbers  only represent two months of results.\\nYou'll see in the line of business results that we are showing First Republic revenue and allowance in CCB, CB and AWM. And f or the\\npurposes of this quarter's results, all of the deposits are in CCB and substantially  all of the expenses are in Corporate. As the integration\\ncontinues, some of those items will get allocated across the segments. Now, turning back to Firmwide results excluding First Republic.\\nRevenue of $38.4 billion was up $6.7 billion or 21% year -on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $7.8 billion or 57%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex.\\nMarkets was down $293 million , largely driven by the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a number of less\\nnotable items primarily in the pr ior year. And Markets revenue was down $772 million or 10% year -on-year. Expenses of $20.2 billion were up\\n$1.5 billion or 8% year -on-year, primarily driven by higher compensation expense, including wage inflation and higher legal expense. And\\ncredit costs  of $1.7 billion included net charge -offs of $1.4 billion , predominantly in Card.\\nThe net reserve build included a $389 million build in the Commercial Bank, a $200 million build in Card, and a $243 million release in\\nCorporate, all of which I will cover in more detail later. On to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of\\n13.8%, flat versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less distributions was offset by the impact of First Republ ic. And as you can\\nsee i n the two charts on the page, we've given you some information about the impact of the transaction on both RWA and CET1 ratio . And as\\nyou know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago. Our new indicative SCB is 2.9% versus our current requirement of 4% and  it goes into\\neffect in 4Q23. The new SCB also reflects the board's intention to increase the dividend to $1.05 per share in the third quar ter.\\nOn liquidity, our Bank LCR for the second quarter ended at 129%, in line with what we anticipated at Investor D ay. About half of the reduction\\nis associated with the First Republic transaction. And while we're on the balance sheet, as we previewed in the 10 -K, we will be updating our\\nEarnings at Risk model to incorporate the impact of deposit repricing lags. So whe n we release this quarter's 10 -Q, you will see the up 100 -\\nbasis point parallel shift scenario will be about positive $2.5 billion whereas in the absence of the change it would have be en about negative\\n$1.5 billion. Now let's go to our businesses starting w ith CCB on page 5. Both U.S. consumers and small businesses remain resilient and we\\nhaven't observed any meaningful changes to the trends in our data we discussed at Investor Day. Turning now to the financial results which I\\nwill speak to excluding the imp act of First Republic for CCB, CB and AWM. CCB reported net income of $5 billion on revenue of $16.4 billion,\\nwhich was up 31% year -on-year.\\nIn Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 59% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End -of-period deposits were down\\n4% quarter -on-quarter , as customers continue to spend down their cash buffers, including for seasonal tax payments, and seek higher -yielding\\nproducts. Client investment assets were up 18% year -on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows across our advisor and\\ndigital channels. In Home Lending, revenue was down 23% year -on-year, driven by lower NII from tighter loan spreads and lower servicing\\nand production revenue. Ori ginations were up quarter -on-quarter , driven by seasonality, although still down 54% year -on-year. Moving to Card\\nServices & Auto, revenue was up 5% , largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto\\nlease income.\\nCard outstandings were up 18% year -on-year, which was the result of revolve normalization and strong new account growth. And in Auto,\\noriginations were up $12 billion, up 71% year -on-year as competitors pull back and inventories continue to sl owly recover. Expenses of $8.3\\nbillion were up 8% year -on-year, driven by compensation, predominantly due to wage inflation and headcount growth as we continue to invest\\nin our front office and technology staffing as well as marketing. In terms of credit p erformance this quarter, our credit costs were $1.5 billion,\\nreflecting a reserve build of $203 million driven by loan growth in Card Services. Net charge -offs were $1.3 billion, up $640 million year -on-\\nyear, predominantly driven by Card as 30 day -plus del inquencies have returned to pre -pandemic levels, in line with our expectations.\\nNext, the CIB on page 6. CIB reported net income of $4.1 billion on revenue of $12.5 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $ 1.5 billion was\\nup 11% year -on-year or down 7% exc luding bridge book markdowns in the prior year. IB fees were down 6% year -on-year and we ranked\\nnumber one with year -to-date wallet share of 8.4%. In Advisory, fees were down 19%. Underwriting fees were down 6% for debt and up 30%\\nfor equity with more posi tive momentum in the last month of the quarter. In terms of the second half outlook, we have seen encouraging signs\\nof activity in Capital Markets and July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year. However, year -to-date announced M&A is\\ndown significantly, which will be a headwind.\\nMoving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year -on-year. Fixed Income was down 3%. As expected, the macro franchise\\nsubstantially normalized from last year's elevated levels of volatility and clien t flows. This was largely offset by improved performance in the\\nSecuritized Products Group and Credit. Equity Markets was down 20% against a very strong prior -year quarter, particularly in derivatives.\\nPayments revenue was $2.5 billion, up 61% year -on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 32%, predominantly driven by higher rates,\\npartially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year -on-year, driven by higher rates, partially\\noffset by lower fees. Exp enses of $6.9 billion were up 1% year -on-year, driven by higher non -compensation expense as well as wage inflation\\nand headcount growth, largely offset by lower revenue -related compensation.\\nMoving to the Commercial Bank on page 7. Commercial Banking repo rted net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.8 billion was up 42%\\nyear-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2.2 billion was up 79% year -on-year, driven by higher rates. Gross\\nInvestment Banking and Markets revenue of $767 milli on was down 3% year -on-year, primarily driven by fewer large M&A deals. Expenses of\\n$1.3 billion were up 12% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology\\ninvestments, as well as higher volu me-related expense. Average deposits were up 3% quarter -on-quarter, driven by inflows related to new\\nclient acquisition, partially offset by continued attrition in non -operating deposits. Loans were up 2% quarter -on-quarter. C&I loans were up\\n2%, reflectin g stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization in the current economic environment, as well as pockets of growth  in\\nareas where we are investing.\\nCRE loans were also up 1%, reflecting funding on prior -year originations for construction loans in Real Estate Banking as well as increased\\naffordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were $489 million. Net charge -offs were $100 million, including $82 million in the office real\\nestate portfolio and the net reserve build of $389 million was dri ven by updates to certain assumptions related to the office real estate market\\nas well as net downgrade activity in Middle Market Banking. Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8. Asset & W ealth\\nManagement reported net income of $1.1 billion  with pre -tax margin of 32%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 8% year -on-year, driven by higher\\ndeposit margins on lower balances and higher management fees on strong net inflows. Expenses of $3.2 billion were up 8% year -on-year,\\ndriven by higher compensatio n, including growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue -related compensation, and the impact\\nof Global Shares and J.P. Morgan Asset Management in China, both of which closed within the last year.\\nFor the quarter, record net long -term infl ows were $61 billion, positive across all channels, regions, and asset classes, led by Fixed Income\\nand Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $60 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 16% year -on-year and overall client assets of $4.6\\ntrillion w ere up 20% year -on-year, driven by continued net inflows, higher market levels, and the impact of the acquisition of Global Shares.\\nAnd finally, loans were down 1% quarter -on-quarter, driven by lower securities -based lending and deposits were down 6%. Turn ing to\\nCorporate on page 9. As I noted upfront, we are reporting the First Republic bargain purchase gain and substantially all of t he expenses in\\nCorporate. Excluding those items, Corporate reported net income of $339 million. Revenue was $985 million, up  $905 million compared to last\\nyear.\\nNII was $1.8 billion, up $1.4 billion year -on-year due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $782 million and included the net\\ninvestment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $590 million were up $384 million year -on-year, largely driven by higher legal\\nexpense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $243 million, reflecting a reserve release as the deposit placed with First R epublic in the first\\nquarter was eliminated as part of th e transaction. Next, the outlook on page 10. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be\\napproximately $87 billion, with the increase driven by higher rates coupled with slower deposit reprice than previously assum ed across both\\nConsumer and Wholesale . And I should take the opportunity to remind you once again that significant sources of uncertainty remain and we\\ndo expect the NII run rate to be substantially below this quarter's run rate at some point in the future as competition for d eposits plays ou t.\\nOur expense outlook for 2023 remains approximately $84.5 billion. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net char ge-off rate to\\nbe approximately 2.6%. So to wrap up, we are proud of the exceptionally strong operating results this quarter. A s we look forward, we remain\\nfocused on the significant uncertainties relating to the economic outlook, competition for deposits, and the impact on capita l from the pending\\nfinalization of the Basel III rules. Nonetheless, despite the likely headwinds ahea d, we remain optimistic about the company's ability to\\ncontinue delivering excellent performance through a range of scenarios.\\nWith that, operator,

Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.\\nStarting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $8.3 billion, EPS of $2.63, on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 16%.\\nThese results include approximately $900 million of credit reserve builds, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, as well a s $500 million of\\nlosses in credit adjustmen ts and other in CIB.\\nRegarding loan growth, we're continuing to see positive trends with loans up 8% year -on-year and 1% quarter -on-quarter ex PPP with the\\nsequential growth driven by continued pick -up in demand in our wholesale businesses, including ongo ing strength in AWM.\\nOn page 2, we have some more detail on our results. Revenue of $31.6 billion was down $1.5 billion or 5% year on year. NII ex  Markets was\\nup $1 billion or 9% on balance sheet growth and higher rates, partially offset by lower NII from  PPP loans. NIR ex Markets was down $2.2\\nbillion or 17% predominantly driven by lower IB fees, lower home lending production revenue, losses in credit adjustments and  other in CIB as\\nwell as investment securities losses in corporate. And markets revenue wa s down $300 million or 3% against a record first quarter last year.\\nExpenses of $19.2 billion were up approximately $500 million or 2%, predominantly on higher investments and structural expens es, largely\\noffset by lower volume and revenue related expense s. Credit costs were $1.5 billion for the quarter. We built $902 million in reserves driven by\\nincreasing the probability of downside risks due to high inflation and the war in Ukraine, as well as builds for Russia -associated exposures in\\nCIB and AWM. Net charge -offs of $582 million were down year -on-year and comparable to last quarter and remain historically low across our\\nportfolios.\\nOn to balance sheet and capital on page 3. Our CET1 ratio ended at 11.9%, down 120 basis points from the prior quarter. As  a reminder, we\\nexited the fourth quarter with an elevated buffer to absorb anticipated changes this quarter, the largest being SA -CCR adoption as well as\\nsome pick -up in seasonal activity. In addition to those anticipated items, there were a couple of oth er drivers. The rate selloff led to AOCI\\ndrawdowns in our AFS portfolio, but keep in mind, all else equal, these mark -to-market losses accrete back to capital through time and as\\nsecurities mature.\\nAnd price increases across commodities resulted in higher  counterparty credit and market risk RWA. While, of course, the environment is\\nuncertain, many of these effects are now in the rearview mirror. And as a result, we believe that our current capital and fut ure earnings profile\\nposition us well to continue su pporting business growth, while meeting increasing capital requirements as we look ahead.\\nWith that, let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page 4. CCB reported net income of $2.9 billion on\\nrevenue of $12.2 billion, whi ch was down 2% year -on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 8%, predominantly driven by\\ngrowth in deposit balances and client investment assets, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Deposits were up 18%  year-on-year\\nand 4% quarte r-on-quarter, consistent with last quarter. And client investment assets were up 9% year -on-year, largely driven by flows in\\naddition to market performance.\\nIn Home Lending, revenue was down 20% year -on-year, on lower production revenue from both lower ma rgins and volumes against a very\\nstrong quarter last year, largely offset by higher net servicing revenue. Originations of $24.7 billion declined 37% with the  rise in rates, and as\\na result, mortgage loans were down 3%.\\nMoving to Card & Auto, revenue was down 8% year -on-year, primarily on strong new card account originations leading to higher acquisition\\ncosts. Card outstandings were up 11%, and revolving balances have continued to grow, ending the quarter above the first quart er of 2021\\nlevels. And in Aut o, originations were $8.4 billion, down 25% due to the lack of vehicle supply, while loans were up 3%.\\nTouching on consumer spend, combined credit and debit spend was up 21% year -on-year, with growth stronger in Credit as we see a\\ncontinued pickup in trav el and dining. And as the quarter progressed, we saw a robust reacceleration of T&E spend, up 64%. Expenses of\\n$7.7 billion were up 7% year -on-year, driven by higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume - and revenue -\\nrelated  expenses.\\nNext, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.5 billion for the first quarter. Investmen t Banking revenue\\nof $2.1 billion was down 28% versus the prior year. IB fees were down 31% year -on-year. We maintained  our number one rank with a wallet\\nshare of 8%. In advisory, fees were up 18%, and it was the best first quarter ever, benefiting from the closing of deals anno unced in 2021.\\nDebt underwriting fees were down 20%, primarily driven by leveraged finance as i ssuers contended with market volatility. And in equity\\nunderwriting, fees were down 76% on lower issuance activity, particularly in North America and EMEA.\\nMoving to Markets, total revenue was $8.8 billion, down 3% against a record first quarter last year. Fixed income was relatively flat, driven by a\\ndecline in securitized products, where rising rates have slowed down the pace of mortgage production, largely offset by growt h in currencies\\nand emerging markets and commodities on elevated client activit y in a volatile market. Equity Markets were down 7% against an all -time\\nrecord quarter last year. This quarter, however, was our second best, with robust client activity across both derivatives and  cash. And Prime\\ncontinued to perform well, with client bal ances hovering around all -time highs.\\nCredit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $524 million, driven by funding spread widening as well as credit valuation adjustme nts relating to\\nboth increases in commodities exposures and markdowns of derivatives receiva bles from Russia -associated counter parties.\\nLet me take a second here to address the widely reported situation in the nickel market as it relates to our results this qua rter. We were\\nhedging positions for clients closely linked to nickel producers, who g enerally sell forward a portion of the coming year's production. The\\nextreme price movements created margin calls, which we and other banks are helping to address. Because this is counterparty r elated, not\\ntrading, it appears in the Credit Adjustments & Ot her line, where it contributed about $120 million to the reported loss I just mentioned. It also\\ndrove approximately half of the increase in market risk RWA that I noted on the capital slide, and was a driver of higher rep orted VaR, which\\nwill also be elev ated in our upcoming filings.\\nPayments revenue was $1.9 billion, up 33% year -on-year, or up 9% excluding net gains on equity investments driven by continued growth in\\nfees, deposit balances and higher rates.\\nSecurities Services revenue of $1.1 billion wa s up 2% year -on-year driven by higher rates and growth in fees. Expenses of $7.3 billion were up\\n3% year -on-year mostly due to higher structural expenses and investments largely offset by lower volume - and revenue -related expenses.\\nMoving to Commercial Ba nking on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $850 million, and an ROE of 13%. Revenue of $2.4\\nbillion was flat year -on-year with higher payments revenue and deposit balances offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross\\nInvestment Banking  revenue of $729 million was down 35%, driven by both fewer large deals and less flow activity.\\nExpenses of $1.1 billion were up 17% year -on-year largely driven by investments and volume - and revenue -related expenses. Deposits were\\ndown 2% quarter -on-quarter, as client balances are seasonally highest at year -end.\\nLoans were up 5% year -on-year and up 3% quarter -on-quarter excluding PPP. C&I loans were up 3% sequentially ex PPP, reflecting higher\\nrevolver utilization and originations across middle market an d corporate client banking. CRE loans were up 3% driven by strong loan\\noriginations and funding across the portfolio.\\nAnd then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with a  pre-tax\\nmargin of 30%. Revenue of $4.3 billion was up 6% year -on-year, as growth in deposits and loans and higher management fees and\\nperformance fees in alternative investments were partially offset by deposit margin compression and the absence of investment  valuati on\\ngains from the prior year.\\nExpenses of $2.9 billion were up 11% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments as well as higher\\nvolume and revenue related expenses. For the quarter, net long -term inflows of $19 billio n were positive across all channels with strength in\\nequities, multi -asset and alternatives, and in liquidity, we saw net outflows of $52 billion.\\nAUM of $3 trillion and overall client assets of $4.1 trillion, up 4% and 8% year -on-year respectively, were driven by strong net inflows. And\\nfinally, loans were up 3% quarter -on-quarter with continued strength in mortgages and securities -based lending, while deposits were up 9%.\\nTurning to Corporate on page 8, Corporate reported a net loss of $856 million. Rev enue was a loss of $881 million, down $408 million year -\\non-year. NII was up $319 million due to the impact of higher rates, and NIR was down $727 million due to losses on legacy equity  investments\\nversus gains last year, as well as approximately $400 milli on of net realized losses on investment securities this quarter. Expenses of $184\\nmillion were lower by $692 million year -on-year, primarily due to the contribution to the firm's foundation in the prior year.\\nNext, the outlook on page 9. We still expect N II ex Markets to be in excess of $53 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $77\\nbillion. And we'll update these and give you more color at Investor Day next month.\\nSo to wrap up, once again this quarter the company's performance was strong in a  particularly volatile and challenging environment. We\\nhelped our clients navigate very difficult markets, provided support to relief efforts and implemented economic sanctions of unprecedented\\ncomplexity with multiple directives from governments around th e world. And, of course, our thoughts remain with everyone, including our\\nemployees, affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\\nLooking ahead, the US economy remains robust, but we're watching high inflation, the reversal of QE and rising rates, as well  as the ongoing\\neffects of the war on the global economy.\\nWith that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 22,\n        \"max\": 25,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          23\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"quarter\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 4,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":21}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["management_discussion_df.to_csv('management_discussion_transcripts.csv')\n","q_and_a_df.to_csv('q_and_a_transcripts.csv')"],"metadata":{"id":"gGMoeWp68wJR","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749193172920,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":1,"user":{"displayName":"Leslie Pan","userId":"16112359229020717760"}}},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# TEST AREA"],"metadata":{"id":"b4h9uLkSXsBL"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Parse the pdf into separate dataframes\n","pdf_text = extract_text_from_pdf('/content/Transcripts/2q22-earnings-transcript.pdf')\n","print(pdf_text)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"i87qZrVOGpBe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1749193173779,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":854,"user":{"displayName":"Leslie Pan","userId":"16112359229020717760"}},"outputId":"611941a0-35ce-4efa-fedc-8780c256caa5"},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["   \n"," \n","2Q22 FINANCIAL RESULTS  \n","EARNINGS CALL TRANSCRIPT  \n","July 14, 2022 \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n"," \n","  \n","   \n"," \n","  \n","  \n","  \n","2 \n"," \n","MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................   \n","Operator:  Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

The firm reported net income of $8.6 billion, EPS of $2.76 on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 17%. \n","Touching on a few highlights, we had another quarter of strong performance in markets, which generated revenue of nearly $8 billion. Credit is \n","still quite healthy, and net charge- offs remain historically low. And there continue to be positive trends in loan growth across our businesses, \n","with average loans up 7% year -on-year and 2% quarter -on-quarter.  \n"," \n","On page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $31.6 billion was up $235 million or 1% year -on-year. NII ex markets was up $2.8 billion or \n","26%, driven by higher rates and balance sheet growth. NIR ex markets was down $3.6 billion or 26%, largely driven by lower IB fees and \n","higher card acquisition costs. And markets revenue was up $1 billion or 15% year -on-year.  \n"," Expenses of $18.7 billion were up $1.1 billion or 6% year -on-year, predominantly on higher investments and struc tural expenses, partially \n","offset by lower volume-  and revenue- related expenses. And credit costs were $1.1 billion, which included net charge- offs of $657 million and \n","reserve builds of $428 million, reflecting loan growth as well as a modest deterioration in the economic outlook.  \n"," On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. Let's start by talking about our plans for capital managem ent over the coming quarters. The new \n","4% SCB will raise our standardized CET1 requirement to 12% effective in the fourth quarter,  and the 4% GSIB effective in 1Q 2023 further \n","raises this requirement to 12.5%. At Investor Day, we said that we expected SCB t o be higher and made it clear that in the near -term, share \n","buybacks would be significantly reduced in order to build capital for the increased requirements. In light of the SCB coming in even higher than \n","expected, we have paused buybacks for the near -term.  \n"," \n","As we discussed at Investor Day and as we show at the bottom of this presentation page, our organic capital generation allows  us to rapidly \n","build capital in excess of future requirements, with a current target of roughly 12.5% in the fourth quarter. Any excess  over the regulatory \n","requirements offers us protection against a range of economic scenarios with room to deploy capital in  line with our strategic priorities. We \n","have a long- established track record of balance sheet discipline across the company, and this quarter's RWA reduction shows evidence of this \n","discipline.  \n"," Turning to this quarter's results, you can see that our CET1 r atio of 12.2% is up 30 basis points from the prior quarter. Our RWA was down \n","approximately $44 billion with growth in franchise lending being more than offset by the combination of active balance sheet management and \n","the normalization of market risk RWA fr om the first quarter. CET1 capital was slightly down as earnings were offset by distributions and the \n","impact of AOCI drawdowns in our AFS portfolio.  \n"," Now, let's go to our businesses starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page 4. Before I review CCB' s performance, let me touch on \n","what we're seeing in our data regarding the health of the US consumer. Spend is still healthy wi th combined debit and credit spend up 15% \n","year-on-year. We see the impact of inflation and higher nondiscretionary spend across i ncome segments. Notably, the average consumer is \n","spending 35% more year -on-year on gas and approximately 6% more on recurring bills and other nondiscretionary categories.  \n"," At the same time, we have yet to observe a pullback in discretionary spending including in the lower income segments with travel and dining growing a robust 34% year -on-year overall. And with spending growing faster than incomes, median deposit balances are down across \n","income segments for the first time since the pandemic started though c ash buffers still remain elevated.  \n"," \n","With that as a backdrop, this quarter, CCB reported net income of $3.1 billion on revenue of $12.6 billion which was down 1% year -on-year. In \n","Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 9% year -on-year driven by growth i n deposits. Deposits were up 13% year -on-year and 2% \n","quarter -on-quarter, and client investment assets were down 7% year -on-year driven by market performance partially offset by flows.  \n","  \n","3 \n"," \n","Home Lending revenue was down 26% year -on-year, as the rate environment  drove both lower production revenue and tighter spreads, \n","partially offset by higher net servicing revenue and mortgage origination volume of $22 billion was down 45%.  \n"," \n","Moving to Card & Auto , revenue was down 6% year -on-year reflecting higher acquisition c osts on strong new card account originations and \n","lower auto lease income largely offset by higher card NII. Card outstandings were up 16%, and revolving balances were up 9%. And in auto, originations were $7 billion down 44% from record levels a year ago due to continued lack of vehicle supply and rising rates while loans were up 2%. Expenses of $7.7 billion were up 9% year -on-year driven by higher investments of structural expenses partially offset by lower volume-  \n","and revenue- related expenses.  \n"," In terms of actual credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $761 million reflecting net charge- offs of $611 million, dow n $121 million \n","year-on-year driven by C ard and a reserve build of $150 million in C ard driven by loan growth.  \n"," \n","Next, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $3.7 billion on revenue of $11.9 billion. There were a number of notable items this \n","quarter, including net markdowns on certain equity investments of approximately $370 million, with about $345 million reflected in pay ments \n","and m arkdowns on the bridge book of approximately $250 million in IB revenue.  \n"," \n","Investment Banking revenue of $1.4 billion was  down 61% year -on-year or down 53% excluding the bridge book markdowns. IB fees were \n","down 54% versus an all -time record quarter last year. We maintained our number -one rank with a year -to-date wallet share of 8.1%. In \n","Advisory, fees were down 28% reflecting a decline in announced activity which started in the first quarter. The volatile market resulted in \n","muted issuance in our underwriting businesses.  \n"," \n","Underwriting fees were down 53% for debt and down 77% for equity. In terms of outlook, while our existing pipeline remains healthy, \n","conversion of the deal backlog may be challenging if the current headwinds continue. Lending revenue of $410 m illion was up 79% versus the \n","prior year driven by gains on mark -to-market hedges as  well as higher loan balances.  \n"," \n","Moving to Markets , total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 15% year -on-year in both Fixed Income and E quities against a strong quarter last year. \n","In Fixed Income, elevated volatility drove both increased client flows and robust t rading results in the macro franchise, most notably in \n","currencies and emerging markets. This was partially offset by credit and securitized products in a challenging spread environment. In E quity \n","Markets, we had a strong second quarter and again increased volatility produced a strong performance in derivatives. Credit Adjustments & \n","Other was a loss of $218 million largely driven by funding spread widening.  \n"," Payments revenue w as $1.5 billion, up 1% year -on-year or up 25% excluding the markdowns on equity inv estments. The year -on-year growth \n","was primarily driven by higher rates. Security Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year -on-year with growth in fees and higher rates  \n","more than offsetting the impact of lower market levels. Expenses of $6.7 billion w ere up 3% year -on-year predominantly driven by higher \n","structural expenses and investments, largely offset by lower revenue- related compensation.  \n"," \n","Moving to Commercial Banking on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1 billion. Revenue of $2.7 billion was up 8% year -on-\n","year driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower I nvestment Banking revenue. Gross I nvestment Banking revenue of $788 \n","million was d own 32% driven by lower debt and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of $1.2 bil lion were up 18% year -on-year predominantly \n","driven by higher structural and volume-  and revenue- related expenses. Deposits were down 5% quarter -on-quarter driven by migration of non-\n","operating deposits in to higher yielding alternatives which we expect to continue given the current rate environment.  \n"," Loans were up 4% sequentially. C&I loans were up 6% reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across middle mar ket and \n","corporate client banking. CRE loans were up 3% driven by strong loan originations and funding in commercial term lending and real estate \n","banking. Finally, credit costs of $209 million were largely driven by loan growth while net charge- offs remain hist orically low.  \n"," \n","Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with pre- tax margin of \n","31%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.3 billion was up 5% year -on-year driven by growth in deposits and l oans as well as higher margins, \n","partially offset by investment valuation losses ver sus gains in the prior year. In addition, reductions in management fees linked to this year's \n","market declines have been almost entirely offset by the removal of most money m arket fund fee waivers. Expenses of $2.9 billion were up \n","13% year -on-year, largely driven by investments in our private banking advisory teams, technology and asset management, as well as higher \n","volume-  and revenue- related expenses.  \n"," For the quarter, net l ong-term inflows of $6 billion were driven by equities. AUM of $2.7 trillion and ov erall client assets of $3.8 trillion down 8% \n","and 6% year -on-year respectively were predominantly driven by lower market levels partially offset by net long- term inflows. Finally, loans \n","were up 1% quarter -on-quarter while deposits were down 7% sequentially driven by seasonal client tax payments.  \n"," \n","Turning to C orporate on page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $174 million. Revenue was $80 million versus a loss in the prior year. NII \n","was $324 million, up $1.3 billion predominantly due to the impact of higher rates, and expenses of $206 million were lower by $309 million \n","year-on-year.  \n","  \n","4 \n"," \n","Next, the outlook on page 9. You w ill recall that at Investor Day, we expected NII ex markets for 2022 to be in excess of $56 billion. We now \n","expect it to be in excess of $58 billion reflecting Fed funds reaching 3.5% by year -end. We still expect adjusted expense to be approximately \n","$77 billion and the C ard net charge- off rate to be less than 2% for 2022.  \n"," \n","So to wrap up, the company's performance was strong again this quart er in what was a complex operating environment. As we look forward, \n","we are mindful of the elevated uncertainty in the global economy, but we feel confident that we are prepared and well -positioned for a broad \n","range of outcomes.  \n"," \n","With that, operator, please open up the line for Q&A.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................   \n","QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION \n","  \n","Operator : Please stand by. And the first question is coming from Steve Chubak from Wolfe Research. Please proceed.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Steven Chubak  \n","Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \n","Hey. Good morning,  Jeremy. Hey, good morning, Jamie. Wanted to start off with a question on capital targets. I don't believe you provided an \n","update on your firm wide CET1 target of 12.5% to 13% . And given the new higher SCB, future increases in your GSIB surcharge to 4.5% , your \n","regulatory minimum is slated to increase beyond 13% by 2024, which is also beyond the horizon reflected on slide 3. And just given that high \n","regulatory minimum, elevated SCB volatility in recent years, what do you believe is an appropriate capital tar get for you to manage to from \n","here over the long term?  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jeremy Barnum  \n","Chief Financial Officer & Member -Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Yeah, Steve, good question. So, obviously, you're right in the sense that we didn't talk about 2024 on the slide. And as you note, we have two \n","GSIB bucket increases coming: one in the first quarter of 2023 and the other one in the first quarter of 2024. So we had work ed all that out at \n","Investor Day and talked about 12.5% to 13% target, which implies sort of  a modest buffer to be used flexibly based on what we expected \n","would be some increase in SCB. Obviously, the increase came in a bit higher than expected, so for now, we're really focused on 1Q 2023. Of \n","course all else equal, you would assume that that 12.5 % to 13% for 2024 would be a little bit higher, but there is another round of SCB and \n","that's a long way away. And as you know and as you can see, there's a lot of organic capital generation. So we'll  kind of cross that bridge \n","when we come to it.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jamie Dimon \n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","We intend to drive that  SCB down by reducing the things that created it.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Steven Chubak  \n","Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \n","Fair enough. And just for my follow up on the loan growth outlook, loan growth continues to surprise positively. Certainly, the tone, Jeremy, \n","that you conveyed was quite constructive despite the challenging macro backdrop. But with companie s citing higher inventory level s, declining \n","personal savings rates, growing inflationary  pressures, whole list of potential headwinds that could negatively impact loan growth from here,  I \n","was hoping you could just speak to the outlook for loan growth across some of the different busines ses. And what do you see as a sustainable \n","run rate of loan growth over the medium term? \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jeremy Barnum  \n","Chief Financial Officer & Member -Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Yeah, so we've talked as you know, Steve, about sort of a mid- to-high- single -digits loan growth expectation for this year, and that outlook is \n","more or less still in place. Obviously, we only have half the year left. We continue to see quite robust C&I growth, both higher revolver utilization and new account origination.  We're al so seeing good growth in CRE. And, of course, we continue to see very robust C ard loan \n","growth, which is nice to see. Outlook beyond this year, I'm not going to give now. And obviously, as you note, it's going to be pretty much a \n","function of the ec onomic environment, so.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................   \n","5 \n"," \n","Jamie Dimon  \n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Yeah, the only thing I would like to add is that certain loan growth is discretionary and portfolio- based. Think of mortgages, and there's a good \n","chance we're going to drive it down substantially.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Steven Chubak  \n","Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q \n","Thanks so much for taking my questions.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jeremy Barnum  \n","Chief Financial Officer & Member -Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Thanks, Steve.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n"," \n","Operator : The next question  is coming from Glenn Schorr from Evercore ISI. Please proceed.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Glenn Schorr  \n","Analyst, Evercore ISI  Q \n","Hi. Thanks very much. I wonder if you could just talk to how you balance it all, meaning JPMorgan is always growth- minded. You underwrite \n","for returns ov er the cycle. I get that. But given some of the potential bad stuff going on in the world that you've noted in some of the ar ticles \n","you've been in and at the conference, is there any point where that rougher outlook has you tightening the underwriting box to build capital \n","and liquidity faster? Or do you think you can get there just through what you've laid out today on the buyback pause?  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jeremy Barnum  \n","Chief Financial Officer & Member -Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Yeah, no, so, I mean, look,  I think all of these things are true at the same time, right? So first of all, as you can see on page 3, the organic \n","capital generation enables us to build very quickly to get to where we need to be with a nice appropriate buffer on time if not early. At the same \n","time, as Jamie has noted, obviously, in this moment, we're going to scrutinize even more aggressively than we always do, elem ents of our \n","lending which are either low returning or have a low client nexus  or both. We do that all the time anyway, but  of course in this moment we're \n","going to turn up the heat on that a little bit.  \n"," \n","In terms of underwriting, as you say, we do underwrite through the cycle. I think we feel comfortable with our risk appetite and our credit box, \n","and I don't think we expect an y particular change there.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jamie Dimon  \n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Yeah, I mean the only thing I would add is that certain, obviously, risks that we take kind of price themselves. So if you look at our bridge book, \n","it's sm aller than it was because we priced ourself out of the market, and that was a good thing because a lot of people will lose a lot of money \n","there, and we lost a little. So we are very conscious of that kind of thing all the time.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Glenn Schorr  \n","Analyst, Ever core ISI  Q \n","Well, I appreciate that. And did you all consider a CECL reserve and increasing the probability to the core scenario in this quarter? And just \n","curious on how you thought about that. Thanks.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jamie Dimon  \n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMo rgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Yes, but we didn't do it. And obviously, what we do in the future quarters will remain to be seen.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................   \n","6 \n"," \n","Jeremy Barnum  \n","Chief Financial Officer & Member -Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Yeah. And, Glenn, just remember that we did do that last quarter, right? So we already introduced a sort of skew to the outlook beyond what's \n","implied by the market to reflect our own slightly more negative view. And in a sense, arguably we were sort of early on that, so it really wasn't \n","necessary t his quarter.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Glenn Schorr  \n","Analyst, Evercore ISI  Q \n","All right. Thank you both.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n"," \n","Operator : The next question is coming from John McDonald from Autonomous Research. Please proceed.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","John E. McDonald  \n","Analyst, Autonomous Research  Q \n","Hi. Good morning. Jerem y, just wondering if you could talk about the deposit trends you're seeing, the differences between commercial \n","deposits, wealth management and retail in terms of flows and repricing pressures.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jeremy  Barnum  \n","Chief Financial Officer & Member -Operating Comm ittee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Yeah. Great question, John. And I think you're right to break it down by the different segments because we are seeing different dynamics \n","there. So on the wholesale side, you do see some lower deposits, some deposit attrition,  and that is entirely expected and part of the plan in \n","the sense that, for client reasons, we had slightly higher appetite, especially in parts of the C ommercial Bank, for non- operating deposits, \n","knowi ng fully that our pricing strategy as rates went up was  going to be not pay off. And therefore, we expected the attrition from that client \n","base. And so we're seeing that, and that's actually something that we want, all else equal, and is playing out in line with expectations.  \n"," You do see a little bit of a decl ine or a little bit of a headwind in Wealth Management. I think that's just seasonal tax payments being a little bit \n","higher than usual. And then on the consumer side, we're really not seeing much at all. So that remains strong. We're not seeing any attriti on \n","there. And it's early in the cycle to really be observing much one way or the other from a pricing perspective.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","John E. McDonald  \n","Analyst, Autonomous Research  Q \n","Okay. And then as a follow up, in  terms of the updated NII outlook, you had talked about an exit rate in the fourth quarter of about $66 billion at \n","Investor Day. Just kind of wondering what that looks like and what kind of fading benefit from rate hikes you have assumed in your outlook.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jeremy Barnum  \n","Chief Financial Officer & Member -Operating  Committee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Yeah, so the $66 billion number, if you want kind of to put a number in, you can use something like $68 billion, $68 billion plus, something like that. Obviously, we're annualizing one quarter, so there can always be noi se in there, but that seems like a good number to us, that's \n","consistent with the increase for the full year. And sorry, John, can you repeat your other question?  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jamie Dimon  \n","Chairman & Chief Execut ive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

A \n","Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in terms of 2023, we had talked at Investor Day about how we saw upside into 2023 from that fourth quarter run rate. \n","And that more or less remains true. There is some upside. Obviously, we're starting from a higher launch point, higher  rates, and less so after \n","the CPI trend, but there have been moments where there were cuts in the 2023 Fed expectations. So that could have some impact on the \n","dynamic. Obviously, this is all in an environment of very volatile implieds, but the core view of  some upside from that fourth quarter run rate \n","into 2023 is still in place.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","John E.

Graseck  \n","Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC  Q \n","Jamie, you mentioned just on the SCB earlier that you intended to reduce it by reducing the things that caused it to rise. Could you give us a \n","sense as to what you saw in the results that you got that drove that SCB up? Because I talk to folks that say it's a black box, so it would be \n","helpful to understand what you se e as what the drivers were to that SCB increase.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jamie Dimon  \n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Well, first of all, it's public, so you can actually go see what drives it, the global market shock and credit losses, stuff like that. And we don't \n","agree with the stress test. It's inconsistent. It's not transparent. It's too volatile. It's basically capricious , arbitra ry... We do 100 a week, this is \n","one. And I think  to drive capital up and down by 80 basis points ... So we'll work on i t. We haven't made definitive decisions, but I've already \n","mentioned about, we dramatically reduced RWA this quarter. We may do that again next quarter. We're probably going to drive down mortgages, and we'll probably drive down other credit too that create s SCB.  \n"," \n","So we're not going to go into specifics on that. It's easy for us to do. You've seen us do it before. We're going to drive down non -operating \n","deposits. It creates no risk to us, but as the GSIB, and various  things. And so we're going to manage the balance sheet, get good returns, \n","have great clients. And I'm not worried about it. We just want to get there right away. I don't want to s it there and dawdle,  that's  the rule, they \n","gave it to us, we're going.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Betsy L.

A \n","But another very important point for shareholders, that number, when they –  that doesn't even remotely – the stress loss doesn't even \n","remotely represent what would happen under that kind of scenario. And I'm not s aying the Fed says it should or shouldn't, but I would tell you \n","we'd make money under that scenario. We wouldn't lose, I think they had us losing $44 billion. There's almost no chance that that would be \n","true. \n"," \n","And I just –  so I –  and I feel bad for the shareholders because people look at that and s ay, well, what's going to happen? I mean but  there's \n","good evidence, we didn't lose money after Lehman, we didn't lose money in the great – what just happened. We didn't lose money in great \n","financial recession.  \n"," \n","The company's got huge underlying earnings power and consistent revenues in CCB, Asset Management custody, payment services. And \n","then we have some kind of fairly volatile streams. And now we've got the CECL, which obviously can go up or down quite a bit.  But again, \n","that's an accounting entry. And so we feel we're in very good shape.

A \n","And, Betsy, ma ybe I'll just comment briefly on the black box point. Because as Jamie noted, the SCB is quite volatile, and I think you see that \n","across the industry. And we feel very good about building quickly enough to meet the higher requirements. But they’re pretty big changes that \n","come into effect fairly qui ckly for banks, and I think that's probably not healthy.  \n"," \n","And the amount of transparency, there is a lot of information released, as Jamie says.

It's a terrible way to run a financial system,  and we owe you \n","more on what we think that buffer should be because we have so much – what I think is so much excess c apital.

Good morning. Maybe just on expenses, if I kind of look at the first half with this slowdown in investment banking, I think your annualized \n","is less than $76 billion, but you're still targeting $77 billion. Is that implication of just higher investment spend in the second half? Or just \n","uncertainty around ge tting th e pipeline completed or not and just assuming it might get done until we know better?  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jeremy Barnum  \n","Chief Financial Officer & Member -Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Yeah, Jim. Good question. We've looked at that too. It's definitely more the former than the latter. In other words, $77 billion is the number that \n","we see right now and the number that we believe. And we can see in our outlook a bunch of factors driving up second half expense including \n","deal M&A closing and adding to the run -rate as well as continued execution of our investment plans resulting in increased head count \n","probably at a faster pace as we kind of have ramped up our hiring capacity and so on.

Great. And then just maybe on credit. It continues to look, I guess, very good, whether it's on the consumer side or co mmercial side. We \n","don't really see it.

A \n","...right. Exa ctly. Obviously still running well below normal levels from the pre- pandemic period. But if you really want to kind of turn up the \n","magnification on the microscope and look really, really, really closely, if you look at cash buffers in the lower income segm ents and early \n","delinquency roll -rates in those segments, you can maybe see a little bit of an early warning signal to the effect that the burn- down of excess \n","cash is a little bit faster there, b uffers are still above what they were pre- pandemi c but coming down,  and that absolute numbers for the typical \n","customer are not that high.  \n"," \n","And you do see those early delinquency buckets still below pre- pandemic levels but getting closer in the lower income segment. So if you \n","wanted to try to look for ear ly warning si gnals, that's where you would see it.

Good morning. Just a follow up on the points about managing the balance sheet and capital and RWAs. How do you think \n","about your ability to manage that RWA output and dimensionalizing how, if at all, it might  impact either the net income outcome or the ROTCE \n","outcome as you look forward?  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jamie Dimon  \n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Just very roughly, we have a tremendous ability to manage it.

Okay. That's a fair point. A nd then just second one on cards. Card revenue rate continues to slip even with the NII benefit.

Thanks.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jeremy Barnum  \n","Chief Financial Officer & Member -Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Yeah, sure. So on Card revenue rate, we'd said that we thought 10% wa s a reasonable number for the full year. And i t's running a little bit \n","lower right now, and I think the current level –  look, what is it  Mikael , 9.6% or something, is probably the right number for the full year at this   \n","11 \n"," \n","Jeremy Barnum  \n","Chief Financial Officer & Member -Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","point. And really the difference is d riven by a couple factors. The main one is tha t while the growth and revolve is basically still in place, our \n","view that we would see normalization revolve balances happening towards early –  beginning of next year, that – starting point of that did get \n","slightly delayed by Omicron, by about six weeks. A nd so that, all else equal, is a little bit of a NII headwind relative to what we'd expected but \n","still obviously very robust.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jamie Dimon  \n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Can I just add a little bit on because I know I'm harping on mortgage a little bit here but I just want to explain it. Because if you go to Europe, \n","okay, the capital held against mortgages is like a fifth of what we have to hold here. And we can obviously manage  that, and standardized risk \n","weighted assets do not represent returns or risk. So there are a lot of ways to manage it, and there's no securitization market today. So our \n","view would change if there's a securitization market. We might do something different . But by not owning it, buying it, selling it, hedging it, \n","swapping it, there are a million ways to manage it without really affecting a lot of your risk and returns. And so it's unfor tunate, because I think \n","this is all kind of a waste of time in terms of serving our client.  \n"," \n","Our job is to serve clients t hrough thick or thin, good or bad, with what they need and how they need it, and now we spend all our time talking \n","about these ridiculous regulatory requirements.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jeremy Barnum  \n","Chief Financial Officer & M ember -Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Right. So yeah and just to finish on Card, so slightly lower NII just from the Omicron delay and that slightly better -than- expected new client \n","acquisition is a driver there. And then there are some subtle kind of funding effects from the higher rate envir onment contributing to it as well.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Ken Usdin  \n","Analyst, Jefferies & Company  Q \n","Okay.

A \n","And so I  had mentioned, I don't know if you were on the media call, but there are very good current numbers taking place. Consumers are in \n","good shape. They're spending money, they have more incom e, jobs are plentiful, they're spending 10% more than last year, almost 30% plus \n","more than pre- COVID. Businesses, you talk to them, they're in good shape, they are doing fine. We've never seen business credit be better \n","ever, like in our lifetimes, and that 's the current environment.  \n"," \n","The future environment, which is not that far  off, involves rates going up maybe more than people think, because of inflation, maybe \n","stagflation, maybe a soft –  there might be a soft landing. I'm simply saying there's a range of potential outcomes from a soft landing to a hard \n","landing,  driven by how much rates go up, the effect of quantitative tightening, the effect of volatile markets and obviously this terrible \n","humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and the war and then the eff ect of that on food and oil and gas. And we're simply pointing out –  those things  \n","make the probabilities and possibilities of these events different.  \n"," It's not going to change how we run the company. The economy will be bigger in 10 years. We're going to run the company. We're going to \n","serve more clients. We're going to open our branches.

We're not  in subprime fundamentally. That's managing your \n","exposures. We're quite careful ab out how we run the risk of the company, and if there was a reason to cut back on something, we would. But \n","not only  do we think it's a great business that's got great growth prospects, it's just going to go through a storm.  \n"," \n","And in fact, going through a storm, we will – that gives us opportunities too.

A \n","I think we gave you some examples at Investor Day. For example, AI,  which we spend a lot of money on, we gave you a couple examples.

That's a huge benefit. I don't think you'd want us to stop doing that because \n","there's a recession. And so plus, in a recession, certain things get cheaper. Branches are enormously profitable. Banks are enormously \n","profitable. And we're going to keep on doing those things, and we've managed through recessions before. We'll manage it again.

Good morning, guys. Jeremy, you touched on the deposit commentary a short while ago. Can you elaborate on QT and t he impact \n","that you've seen? Now, granted, I know June was not full QT of $95 billion a month, but can you guys give us a flavor? And I think, Jamie, you \n","mentioned that if I heard it correctly, that maybe $300 billion to $400 billion of deposits could outflow over time, I'm assu ming due to QT. But \n","can you guys elaborate what you saw in June? Is it  tracking the way you think it's going to be? And any further outlook for what the deposits \n","could be over the next 12 months due to QT? \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jeremy Barnum  \n","Chief Financial Officer & Member -Oper ating Committee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Yeah. Hey, Gerard. So, as you know, QT just started so I think it 's not the sort of thing where you can say I expect this exact outcome and \n","then sort of track it sector -by-sector because you can see the clear impact  on system -wide deposits but that also interacts with RRP and TGA \n","and stuff  like that and so how that flow s into the banking system and then into any individual bank across the wholesale and consumer \n","segments is kind of a tricky thing. So it's early on that. But at a high level and your comments about what Jamie said before are right.  \n"," The story remains true, which is that depending on how QT interacts with RRP and loan growth, in particular, you could see some decline in \n","deposits in the banking system and we would see our share of that but we would expect that to primarily come out of wholesale and primarily \n","come out of the non- operating and sort of less valuable portions of our deposit base. While in consumer, while you could in theory have a little \n","bit of  a headwind there, we feel pretty good about our ability to keep those levels pretty steady based on the s trength of the franchise and the \n","ability to take share.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Gerard Cassidy  \n","Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \n","Very good. And then as a follow up, I don't believe you guys disclosed the outstandings in the bridge book, but two questions. And, Jamie, \n","you've been very clear about this in the last 10 years, how you've de -risked that balance sheet and you mentioned that already today. Can you \n","just give us som e color on how different it is today from 2008- 2009 just so investors know that it is meaningfully different? And second, what \n","caused the write- down in the bridge book this quarter?  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jamie Dimon  \n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","So if you go back to 2007 I think, the whole street bridge book was $480 billion. I think the whole street bridge book today is $100 billion or \n","under $100 billion.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jeremy Barnum  \n","Chief Financial Officer & Member -Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

It's like 20%.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................   \n","14 \n"," \n","Jamie Dimon  \n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Our percent of that bridge brook has come down substantially just in the last 12 months and that's really just underwriting l oan by loan by loan,  \n","and you win s ome and you lose some. And if you guys look at high yield spreads and stuff like that, bonds were down 6%, that's what you \n","see. So you have some flex and we're big boys, we know that, and there is write- downs of a couple of bridge loans. They're not huge.

A \n","Yeah, it's in the IB revenue line and there's a small amount in the C ommercial Bank as well. But as you said, Jamie, and as Daniel also \n","mentioned at Investor Day, I think we made conscious choices here to dial  back our risk appetite here and accepted some share losses in \n","leverage finance. So we feel good about where we are. We're still open for business for the right deals at the right risk appetite on the right \n","term, absolutely, but we've been careful.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Gerard Cassidy  \n","Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC  Q \n","Very good.

Please proceed.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Erika Najarian  \n","Analyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \n","Hi. Just had a few follow -up questions. The first is on balance sheet management  .Jeremy, the illustrative path that you set forth on slide 3, \n","does that include RWA mitigation? And as we think about the $58 billi on-plus in updated NII guide, what kind of deposit growth does that \n","assume? You noted that part of the SCB mitigation is to drive out non- operating deposits. Just wanted to understand what the assumption was \n","there as well, please.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Jeremy Barnum  \n","Chief Fin ancial Officer & Member -Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Yeah. Hey, Erika. S ure. So first point, you have to turn on  your magnifying glass, but if you look at footnote 5 on page 3, you can see that right \n","at the end of there, it says assumes flat RWA in the projection. And I think within that, who knows what the exact mix will be and you've heard \n","Jamie's comments on that, but if you look at the table above, you see that you've got the usual moving parts. We've got organic loan growth \n","that we want  that's profitable on its own, or in part of important relationships that we'd like to s ee continue to happen.  \n"," Some of it is a little bit passive. We can't really control it. It moves up and down as a function of factors like VaR. And t hen there's the \n","mitigation piece of it, which we're going to turn up the scrutiny quite intensely, as I sai d before, on lower returning, lower client  nexus , or both. \n","So across those three bits, we'll see how it goes. But as Jamie said, we feel pretty confident here.  \n"," In term s of deposits, at this point, deposit growth is probably less of a driver overall, looking forward of the NII outlook. Our deposit outloo k \n","remains more or less the same that I said before and that we've talked about at Investor Day, which is we do expect t o see some attrition in \n","wholesale. We expect consumer to be relatively stable, and we'll see how it goes.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................  \n","Erika Najarian  \n","Analyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q \n","Got it. And my follow up question is for Jamie. Jamie, we've heard your caution about the economy, and I think there's a bigger debate on how \n","the US consumer is going to be impacted in light or in contact with the downturn. T he statistics that Jeremy laid out imply a pretty healthy \n","starting point for the consumer that you bank, and the reserve build for loan growth in Card and the less than 2% loss rate in C ard lead us to \n","believe that your consumer is still okay. As you think about the various scenarios and you think about the realistic range of outcomes, how \n","does the US consumer perform, because it feels l ike that's the big wild card. And we've seen the journal term, a job flow or recession. I just \n","wanted to get your thoughts there.  \n"," ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................   \n","15 \n"," \n","Jamie Dimon  \n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A \n","Yeah, so first I just want to point out that, on tha t chart, that's not a forecast what it's going to be at the end of the quarter. So we're going to –  \n","if you're going to penc il in some of your models, it's 12.5% on December 31 and it will probably be 13% at the end of the first quarter. And \n","because obvious ly we use capital for a whole bunch of different reasons. And the consumer – I feel like a broken record. The consumer right \n","now is in great shape. So even if we go into a recession, they're entering that recession with less leverage in far better shape than they did in \n","2008 and 2009 and far better shape than they did even in 2020. And jobs are plentiful.  \n"," \n","Now, of course, jobs  may disappear. Things happen, so, but they're in very good shape. And obviously, when you have recessions, it affects \n","consumer incom e and consumer credit. Our credit card portfolio is prime. I mean, it's exceptional. But again, we're adults in that. We know that \n","if you have a recession loss, it will go up. We prepare for all that, and we're prepared to take it because we grow the business over time. We're not going to just immediately run out of it, and so I think it's great that the consumer's in good shape and it's excellent that –  I like the fact that \n","wages are going up for people on the low end. I like the fact that jobs are plentif ul. I think that's good for the average American, and we should \n","applaud that.

A \n","Yeah, okay, I'll keep it brief. On duration, I think at this level of rates, also with very quickly cash yields being roughly not that different from 10-\n","year yields, the question of duration adding or not is just generally less important for us. Then the other piece of it is whether there's the \n","opportunity to deploy cash into non- HQLA securities broadly into spread produc t, and obviously spread product is more attractive right now. \n","But as we've been talking about a lot on this call, the priority right now is to build capital.

They look  a little different\n","than peers. And when we look at the sensitivity to 100 basis points of higher rates beyond the forward curve, it looks like you're liability\n","sensitive .

A\n","Yeah. Thanks, John. And I'd love to have a very long conversation with you about this, but I'm going to keep it short here. I t's really all about\n","lags. So, as our disclosure says, we do not include the impact of reprice lags in our EaR calculation. So, as a result of that, the entire\n","calculation is based on modeled rates paid in the terminal state.\n","\n","As you well know, right now, we're in the middle of some very significant lags, which are affecting the numbers quite a bit a nd which we expect\n","to persist for s ome time. So, as a result of that, what I would expect in the near term is something quite similar to what we've experienced this\n","year. As you know, this year, as rates have gone up, we've revised our NII outlook from $50 billion at the beginning of the y ear to now $61.5\n","billion. So, as we look forward in the near term from here, I would expect similar type sensitivities to rate fluctuations, g iven the lag\n","environment that we're in.\n","........................................................................... ............................................................................................................................. ..........................\n","John E.

I just think for your\n","models, because of all that kind of stuff, just use a number less than annualized in the $19 billion. So, instead of $76 bill ion, use a number like\n","$74 billion.

Good morning. My first question is a follow -up on Matt's with regarding the buyback. You printed 15% CET1 in the quarter. On a net basis,\n","net of RWA growth, your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of R WA growth. I'm wondering what guideposts\n","you're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that $2 billion a quarter. Do we need to wait for Basel III finalization, which\n","seems like it could be quite delayed?

A\n","Yeah. Erika, that's a good question. And I understand what you're asking – why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit\n","unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision -making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors.\n","But, all the ingredients that you've listed are the r ight ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the\n","finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always\n","at the bottom of the hie rarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities.\n","\n","So, I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with the modest pace for now.

Erika, that's a good question. And I understand what you're asking \\u2013 why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit\\nunsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision -making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors.\\nBut, all the ingredients that you've listed are the r ight ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the\\nfinalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always\\nat the bottom of the hie rarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities.\\nSo, I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with the modest pace for now. But obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to\\nadjust that whenever we want under the  current regime, and we may well do that .\",\n          \"Yeah. Thanks, John. And I'd love to have a very long conversation with you about this, but I'm going to keep it short here. I t's really all about\\nlags. So, as our disclosure says, we do not include the impact of reprice lags in our EaR calculation. So, as a result of that, the entire\\ncalculation is based on modeled rates paid in the terminal state.\\nAs you well know, right now, we're in the middle of some very significant lags, which are affecting the numbers quite a bit a nd which we expect\\nto persist for s ome time. So, as a result of that, what I would expect in the near term is something quite similar to what we've experienced this\\nyear. As you know, this year, as rates have gone up, we've revised our NII outlook from $50 billion at the beginning of the y ear to now $61.5\\nbillion. So, as we look forward in the near term from here, I would expect similar type sensitivities to rate fluctuations, g iven the lag\\nenvironment that we're in.\",\n          \"Yeah. So, good question on the multi -family, and the short answer is that, for us, it's pretty uncontroversially  no \\u2013 no bleed -through. And the\\nreason is that while we are aware of some of the pressure on multi -family, that's in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually\\nbig in. So, it's higher -end stuff in much less supply constrained markets that is under more pres sure. And as you know, our multi -family\\nportfolio is much more affordable, supply constrained markets. And so, the performance there remains really very robust .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":24}]}]}
