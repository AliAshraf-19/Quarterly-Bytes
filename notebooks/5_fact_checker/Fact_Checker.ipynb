Good question. Yeah, look, obviously given what's happened in terms of Fed hike expectations and what's g etting priced\n","into the front end of the curve, we would actually expect the excess part of in excess of $53 billion to be b igger than it was at a Credit Suisse.\n","So to size that, probably a couple billion dollars. But we don't want to get too precise at this point. We want to run our bo ttoms -up process.\n","There have been very big moves and we want to get it right. And so we'll gi ve more detail about that at Investor Day.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Okay. And as my follow up, could you give us some thoughts about the markets related NII? What things should we think about t here, whether\n","it's seasonality or how it's affected by rising rates?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. I guess I would direct you to my comments I think one or two quarters ago on this, but generally speaking that number i s pretty\n","correla ted to the short -term rate. So all else equal, you'll see a headwind in there as the Fed hikes come through which in general in the\n","geography, we would tend to expect that to be offset in NIR. But it's noisy. It can shift as a function of obscure balance s heet composition\n","issues as I've mentioned in the past. And so that's why we don't focus too much on that number.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Okay. Thanks.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Thanks, John .\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): Hey. Good morning,  Jeremy. Hey, good morning, Jamie. Wanted to start off with a question on capital targets. I don't believe you provided an\n","update on your firm wide CET1 target of 12.5% to 13% . And given the new higher SCB, future increases in your GSIB surcharge to 4.5% , your\n","regulatory minimum is slated to increase beyond 13% by 2024, which is also beyond the horizon reflected on slide 3. And just given that high\n","regulatory minimum, elevated SCB volatility in recent years, what do you believe is an appropriate capital tar get for you to manage to from\n","here over the long term?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah, Steve, good question. So, obviously, you're right in the sense that we didn't talk about 2024 on the slide. And as you note, we have two\n","GSIB bucket increases coming: one in the first quarter of 2023 and the other one in the first quarter of 2024. So we had work ed all that out at\n","Investor Day and talked about 12.5% to 13% target, which implies sort of  a modest buffer to be used flexibly based on what we expected\n","would be some increase in SCB. Obviously, the increase came in a bit higher than expected, so for now, we're really focused on 1Q 2023. Of\n","course all else equal, you would assume that that 12.5 % to 13% for 2024 would be a little bit higher, but there is another round of SCB and\n","that's a long way away. And as you know and as you can see, there's a lot of organic capital generation. So we'll  kind of cross that bridge\n","when we come to it.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): We intend to drive that  SCB down by reducing the things that created it.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): Fair enough. And just for my follow up on the loan growth outlook, loan growth continues to surprise positively. Certainly, the tone, Jeremy,\n","that you conveyed was quite constructive despite the challenging macro backdrop. But with companie s citing higher inventory level s, declining\n","personal savings rates, growing inflationary  pressures, whole list of potential headwinds that could negatively impact loan growth from here,  I\n","was hoping you could just speak to the outlook for loan growth across some of the different busines ses. And what do you see as a sustainable\n","run rate of loan growth over the medium term?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah, so we've talked as you know, Steve, about sort of a mid- to-high- single -digits loan growth expectation for this year, and that outlook is\n","more or less still in place. Obviously, we only have half the year left. We continue to see quite robust C&I growth, both higher revolver utilization and new account origination.  We're al so seeing good growth in CRE. And, of course, we continue to see very robust C ard loan\n","growth, which is nice to see. Outlook beyond this year, I'm not going to give now. And obviously, as you note, it's going to be pretty much a\n","function of the ec onomic environment, so.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Yeah, the only thing I would like to add is that certain loan growth is discretionary and portfolio- based. Think of mortgages, and there's a good\n","chance we're going to drive it down substantially.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): Thanks so much for taking my questions.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Thanks, Steve.\n","Analyst (Ken Usdin): Hi. Thanks a lot. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the NII and the deposit side to Jamie's comments there. Obviously, one of the\n","toughest uncertainties is to understand how we think about flows and mix and beta, so just starting to see it, it looks like , in terms of deposit\n","costs starting to increase. So, how do you think about it now in this new environment where we might go to 4.5%, maybe higher, in terms of\n","how betas might act over the course of this cycle as compared to any prior cycles and previous thoughts? Thanks.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah, thanks, Ken. Good morning. Okay. So, at Investor Day, you'll recall that Je nn said that we expected betas to be low this cycle as they\n","were in the prior cycle, which was a low beta cycle by historical standards. And what we're now seeing as we see the rate hikes come through\n","and we see the deposit rate paid develop , is that we're seeing realized betas being even lower than the prior cycle just through the actuals.\n","And the question is why is that ? And it's, of course, we don't really know, but plausible theories include the speed of the hikes, which probably\n","means that some of this is lag, but also the fact that the system is better positioned from a liquidity perspective than in p rior cycles.\n","So, as we look forward, we know that lags are significant right now. We know that at some point th ey will start to come out, obviously in\n","wholesale , they come out much faster. That's probably starting to happen now. But the exact timing of how that develops i s going to be very\n","much a function of the competitive environment in the marketplace for deposits, and we'll see how that plays out.\n","Analyst (Ken Usdin): Got it. Okay. And then just the second follow -up on Jamie's points about, like, okay, if things do look worse ahead, looking ahead you might\n","have to build a little bit more , understandable , over the next couple of years. Can you just help us understand just where you are in your\n","scenario now as scenarios build? And just today still looks great, tomorrow there's some more uncertainty. So, how do we just  get to start to\n","understand how quickly and how you get your handle on that magnitude of ACL delta , and how do you think about it versus either, I don't\n","know, pandemic peak or day one CECL? It's very hard for all of us to see this, of course.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Yeah. As you know, I think CECL is an enormously bad accounting policy. Honestly, I wouldn't spend too much time on it becaus e it's not a\n","real number. It's a hypothetical, probability -based number . I'm trying to make it very simple for  you. So, if you look at the pandemic, we put up\n","$15 billion over two quarters, and then we took it down over three or four after that . And all it did was swing all these numbers , and it didn't\n","change that much.\n","Yeah, I'm trying to give you a number, but obviously this number would be plus or minus several billion. But if unemployment goes to 6% and\n","that becomes the central kind of case and then you have the possibility it gets better and possibility it gets worse , we would probably have to\n","add something like $5 billion or $6 billion. That probably would happen over two or three quarters.\n","Analyst (Ken Usdin): Yeah .\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): I mean that's as simple as I can make it.\n","Analyst (Ken Usdin): Yeah. Okay.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Right now , what we have – right,  we already have a percent in the adverse and severe adverse case s. If we change that next quarter, that will\n","be part of that $6 billion I'm talking about.\n","Analyst (Ken Usdin): Yes. Okay. Understood. Thank you.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Hi. Good morning, Jeremy. I wanted to ask about the NII outlook slide 10. The range of outcomes on deposit  costs is quite wide, as you\n","mentioned. It looks like 1.5% to 2% demonstrated there. Does the $74 billion NII line up with kind of the midpoint of that? M aybe you could\n","give some color about kind of the drivers of the $74 billion and where that lines up on  this range of deposit cost outcomes.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Sure, John. I mean, I wouldn't take the chart on the bottom left too literally. That's just supposed to give a stylized indic ation of the fact that\n","relatively small changes in deposit rate paid for the company on average, as you well know, can produce quit e significant impacts on the NII.\n","And also that there's, as we've already talked about, a meaningful range of possible outcomes for the year -ahead as the deposit reprice path\n","remains uncertain.\n","The outlook is our best guess, as Jamie says, and the drivers within that are the usual drivers. In Wholesale, we would expect to see a little bit\n","of continued attrition, especially of the non -operating type balances, and you're going to see some internal migration there out of non -interest -\n","bearing into inter est-bearing over time.\n","In Consumer, CDs are flowing right now, and we're seeing good new CD production. We've got a 4% CD in the market as of this m orning. And\n","so continued CD production, and internal migration there will be a driver. And the rest of it i s – well, and, of course, as I said in the prepared\n","remarks, we do expect – across the company – modest deposit attrition as we look forward as a function of QT and the rate cycle and so on.\n","So we've got best guesses for all of those in the outlook, and o f course, the actual outcome will be different in one way or another and we'll\n","just run the business this year.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Okay. Thanks. And on buybacks, how will you think about approaching buybacks and putting it in that mix of capital decisions that you have\n","and any thoughts on kind of the size or quantifying the potential buybacks?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah, sure. So, sort of in the mode of like helping you g uys out to put a number in the model, if you sort of look at the way we're seeing things,\n","obviously, we've got another GSIB step coming next year. So, say, a 13.5% target and the sort of using your estimates, organi c capital\n","generation, minus dividends, et  cetera, and all of the elements of uncertainty there, I think a good number to use is something like $12 billion\n","of buybacks for this year for 2023.\n","But you know, of course, that buybacks are always at the end of our capital hierarchy. So if we have bett er uses for the money, those will\n","come first, and the timing and the conditions of how much we do when is entirely at our discretion, and also noting that we a re potentially\n","going to see a Basel III NPR sometime in the first quarter, or maybe in the second  quarter. And while that will be an NPR, and it will only cover\n","part of the surface area and it won't be final, so it's unlikely that it meaningfully shapes short -term decision -making – there will be some\n","information content of that release that could shap e our decisions as well.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Got it. Thank you.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): Hey, good morning.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Good morning, Steve.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): So, Jamie, I was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with SVB impacting the regulatory\n","landscape for the big banks. In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent  capital\n","requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. But what are some of the changes that you're scenario\n","planning for – whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the\n","buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Well, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Loo k, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep\n","breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happen s like this,\n","you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held -to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain\n","type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole  system, just\n","recalibrating things the right way.\n","And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and reg ional\n","banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic – it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is. We do expe ct higher capital\n","from Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an FDIC assessment – that'll be what it is.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): Got it. And just in terms of appetite for the buyback, just given some of the...\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Oh, yeah.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): ...elevated macro uncertainties.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Well, we've told you that we're kind of penciling in $12 billion for this year. Obviously, capital is more than that, but – and we did a little bit of\n","buyback this quarter. We're going to wait and see. We don't mind keeping our powder dry, and you've seen us do that with investment\n","portfolios, and we're also going to do that with capital.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): That's great. I'll hop back into the queue. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Okay.\n","Analyst (Jim Mitchell): Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance up. Clearly, Fed Funds futures are up so it makes some sense. But\n","maybe I guess first, could you kind of discuss – I guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing\n","there so far? It seems to be coming in a little better than expected. And th en secondly, and probably more importantly, can you help us think\n","about the implications of higher -for-longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond? I guess the intermediate term outlook that you\n","guys had talked about?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates cou pled with lower\n","deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time\n","and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of  stable environment\n","from that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously,\n","we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate c ycle into ne xt\n","year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier,  we don't consider\n","this level of NII generation to be sustainable.\n","And we talked previously about a sort of medium -term run rat e in the mid -70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that\n","maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when  that's going to\n","happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment; that's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace. But we want to\n","be clear that we do expect it at some point.\n","Analyst (Jim Mitchell): Okay. But I guess just one follow -up on that. Just if we don't get rate cuts till middle of next year or later, does that sort of give some\n","confidence to the outlook for next year or are you still worried about significant reprice?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): I wou ldn't necessarily assume that the evolution from the current run rate into that mid -70s number is that sensitive to the rate outlook in\n","particular. When we put that number out there, we looked at a range of different types of rate environments and the repr ice that we think would\n","be associated with that. It was really meant to capture more of what we consider to be a through -the-cycle sustainable number, so I wouldn't\n","think of it as being particularly rate -dependent.\n","Analyst (Jim Mitchell): Okay. Great. Thanks.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Hi, good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color in what you're seeing so far on deposit re price and\n","migration. What's been better than expected so far on that front? And how do you see higher -for-longer rates potentially impacting deposit\n","reprice pressure?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So, as we talked a little bi t about on the\n","press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think\n","that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. A nd, of course, that hasn't\n","happened yet this year, so that's one factor.\n","In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting – continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money\n","in motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration.\n","But that’s sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say.\n","In terms of higher -for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration\n","and possibly moderate effects. And in the end, as we always say, we’re going to price products as a function of the competiti ve market\n","environment.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): And just as a follow up, it seems like you’ve done some securities repositioning the last couple quarters. How are you positi oning the balance\n","sheet in terms of cash and the securities portfolio, given your outlook for rates?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. I think I would say that while we're not predicting higher rates, I don't know if Jamie will have something to say here , we believe in being\n","prepared for it and that's been our position for some time and, of course, that's produced good results. And we continue to try to position\n","ourselves so that neither have significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large chal lenge to the company. So\n","probably at the margin, we're still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates. But, do keep in mind that when modeling th e duration of the\n","balance sheet, higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the  deposit side, so that can be a factor as well.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Okay, thanks.\n","Analyst (Matt O'Connor): Good morning. Thanks for all the comments on the net interest income. Any updates on that medium term outlo ok that you've put out there ?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we'd put out there, and I wou ldn't exactly describe\n","that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over earning . So, not\n","particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out, again, as we highlight on the page, and as I hig hlighted in the prepared\n","remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiti ng below $88 billion and\n","some significant sequential decline. So, in that sense, you can see us kind of ma rching on the path to that $80 billion. Whether we ever get to\n","the $80 billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year .\n","Analyst (Matt O'Connor): Okay. And then just separately, you bought back couple of billion dollars of stock this quarter. What's your thought process on buybacks given\n","the strong capital generation, but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals ?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. Good question. And I think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in g eneral\n","based on our organic capital generation. So, the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a mo dest pace of\n","buybacks consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us  do, in light of the\n","– probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also just\n","as a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile. So, that's another factor that we need to keep in mind .\n","Analyst (Matt O'Connor): Okay. Thank you .\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Thanks, Matt.\n","Analyst (Betsy L. Graseck): Hi. Good morning.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Morning .\n","Analyst (Betsy L. Graseck): So, a couple of questions here. Just, one, Jamie, could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of mid -cycle, it felt like, pre -\n","CCA R? And also , help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio , range should be. Because\n","over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so, is this suggesting we could be towards the  higher -end of\n","that range or even expanding above that?\n","And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%. I know i t's – we\n","have to wait for Basel III Endgame re -proposal to come through a nd all that , but should we be expecting that, hey, we're going to hold 15%\n","CET1 until we know all these rules? Thanks .\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Yeah. So, Betsy, before I answer the question , I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and , me personally, thrilled to have\n","you on this call. For those that don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode  and it's a reminder to all of us how lucky we are\n","to be here. B ut, Betsy, in particular, the amount of respect we have , not just in your work , but in your character over the last 20  plus years has\n","been exceptional. So, on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here.\n","And so, you 're asking a  pertinent  question. So, we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we've increased the\n","dividend. And if you're asking me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like a third, a third of normalized earnings.  Of course, it's hard to\n","calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit beh ind that sometimes.\n","If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera, I think the fa r more important question is the 15%. So, look at the 15% ,\n","I'm going to oversimplify it , that basically will prepare us for the total Basel Endgame today, roughly. The specifics don't matter that much.\n","Jamie Dimon\n","Cha irman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMo rgan Chase & Co.  A\n","Remember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short -run or the long -run, but it looks like Basel III Endgame may not be the worst\n","case. It'll be something less than that. So, obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say in the\n","order of $20 billion or something like that .\n","And, yes, we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business firs t, I mean, pay the\n","dividend  – steady dividend, build the business, and if we think it's a ppropriate to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2\n","billion a quarter (sic) . I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices. I think you've all heard me talk about\n","the world, things like that. So, w aiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific\n","with you all.\n","But in the meantime, there's also – it's very important to put in mind, there are short -term uses for capital that are good for shareholders, that\n","could reduce our CET1  too. So, you may see us do things in the short -run that will increase earnings, increase capital, that are using up that\n","capital. Jeremy mentioned on the – on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and\n","trading, we could do things now.\n","So, it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess cap ital is not wasted\n","capital, it's earnings in store. W e will deploy it in a very good way for shareholders in due course.\n","Analyst (Betsy L. Graseck): Excellent. Thank you so much.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): And yeah, Betsy, I just wanted to add my welcome back thoughts as well, and just a very minor edit to Jamie's answer. I think he just\n","misspoke when he said $2 billion a year in buybacks. The trajectory is $2 billion.. .\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Oh. Sorry. $2 billion a quarter. Yeah.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): ...a quarter. Otherwise, I have nothing to add to Jamie's very complete answer. But welcome back, Betsy.\n","Analyst (Betsy L. Graseck): Okay. Thank you so much, and appreciate it. Looking forward to seeing you at Investor Day on May 20 th.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Excellent. Us too .\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): Hi. Good morning, Jeremy.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Good morning, Steve.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): So, wanted to start off with a question on capital just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revision s to both Basel III\n","Endgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital\n","scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target? And\n","if so, just how that might impact or inf orm your appetite for buybacks going forward?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Right. Okay. Thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not abl e to join because\n","he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today.\n","Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that qu estion would be\n","no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an  upward revision on ROTCE.\n","If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17%  through the\n","cycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majori ty of them involve expansions of the denominator.\n","And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those wo uld be thought of as\n","mitigants rather than things that would actually, like incre ase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed.\n","So, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage\n","you've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here. But in reality, we don't know anything you\n","don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital retur n and buyback\n","trajectory, no t much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jam ie\n","made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference.\n","So, maybe I'll just briefly s ummarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on\n","capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever -expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over\n","time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of\n","the deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if.\n","On the capital hierarchy, it's al so worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business\n","organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intenti on to increase it to\n","$1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital.\n","And then, finally buybacks. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quart er. And so, as we\n","sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportuni ties to deploy the\n","capital outside the Firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience. So, given all\n","that, putting it all together, and sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital . And as Jamie has\n","said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): No need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful  perspective. Maybe just for my follow -up on NII, you've been very consistent just in\n","flagging the risk related to NII overearning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwin ds. In the second\n","quarter, we did see at leas t some moderation in repricing pressures, deposit balances were also more resilient in with a seasonally weak\n","Steven Chubak\n","Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q\n","quarter for deposit growth. So, just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating, do you see the pote ntial for NII\n","normali zing higher? And where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. Interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressu res are slightly\n","abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, QT is still a bit of a headwind, loan grow th is modest and not enough to\n","offset that. And our PE seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it migh t not go down that\n","much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves  into the system. But on balance net across all those\n","various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So, when we think of our balance outlook, w e see it as flat to\n","slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and gro wth ambitions offsetting those system -wide headwinds.\n","So, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what, but I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the\n","overearning narrative or the normalization narrati ve. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the\n","year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So, two cuts versus six cuts is the  main difference\n","there. But obvious ly, based on the latest inflation data and so on, you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield\n","curve. So, we'll see how it goes and in the end, we're kind of focused on, on just running the place, recognizing, and trying  not to be distracted\n","by what remains some amount of overearning, whatever it is.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): Understood, Jeremy. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Thanks, Steve.\n","Analyst (Jim Mitchell): Hey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex. Markets about 6%. So, can you\n","just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit  behavior and pricing since\n","the 50 basis point cut?\n","And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow -up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a\n","month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for 2025? Thanks.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability. So, as we sit here today, the biggest single driver of the\n","sequential decline is, in fact – that we're expecting – is, in fact, the yield curve. So, that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made\n","his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly.\n","In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the Fed starting the cutting cycle , it feels to us like\n","right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for Consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as w e speak. When you look at\n","yield-seeking behavior that has come down quite a bit, so that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at\n","checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as  an indication that consumers are kind of done\n","spending down their cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances.\n","And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix where, with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty\n","high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now.\n","And then as we move to Wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there, and when you combine that with the sort of\n","increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of QT will be announced sometime  soon, that's also a little bit\n","supportive for deposit balances.\n","So, maybe, I'll – well, I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a\n","sequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chan ce that we would see sequential\n","increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the troug h when that\n","happens. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now.\n","But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes obviously, we do see a pretty clear p icture of\n","sequential declines in NII ex. Markets, but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which poi nt the combination of\n","balances, Card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth, obviously.\n","We're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I th ink that gives you a better\n","framework to work with.\n","Analyst (Jim Mitchell): All right. Thanks a lot.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Thanks.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your\n","growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity\n","cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment\n","opportunities?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. Good question, John, and welcome back, by the way.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Thank you.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Welcome back, John. Read your piece the other day. It took me quite a while, but it was good work.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Thanks.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we\n","feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We\n","believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current\n","opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it\n","quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have\n","enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here.\n","So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we\n","find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in\n","order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which\n","is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but\n","that is our current thinking.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say,\n","last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of\n","efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Sure. The truth is – and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high\n","certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and\n","those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the\n","Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a\n","level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the\n","ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and\n","iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent.\n","I think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at\n","this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms-\n","up culture, and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're\n","putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a\n","lot of focus on that – the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that\n","generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as\n","well.\n","And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization\n","spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from\n","here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of\n","capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.\n","Jeremy Barnum\n","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A\n","Finally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and\n","it has been for very good reasons. And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently.\n","But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that\n","some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try\n","to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some\n","important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as\n","they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high\n","certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like\n","cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about\n","efficiency in the current moment.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Very helpful. Thank you.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Efficiently said.\n","Analyst (Ken Usdin): Good morning, Jeremy. Wondering if you could start by just kind of amplifying just the macro commentary that you started off on. And given\n","the uncertainty in the world that you referenced, just how are you seeing the activity change across the customer base from consumers to\n","wholesale? And can you just talk through how that's also just informing any changes in your – some of your growth and reserving\n","expectations? Thanks.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Sure, Ken. So I mean, at a high level, I would say that obviously, some of the salient news flow is quite recent. So, we've done some soundings\n","and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side. I think on the consumer side, the thing to check is the spending data.\n","And to be honest, the main thing that we see there, what would appear to be a certain amount of frontloading of spending ahead of people\n","expecting price increases from tariffs. So ironically, that's actually somewhat supportive, all else equal. But I think what it sort of highlights is\n","that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty, you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger\n","conclusions.\n","In terms of our corporate clients, obviously, they've been reacting to the changes in tariff policy. And at the margin, that shifts their focus away\n","from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the Investment Banking pipeline outlook towards more short-term work, optimizing\n","supply chains and trying to figure out how they're going to respond to the current environment. So as a result, I think we would characterize\n","what we're hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude.\n","I do think you see obvious differences across sectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more\n","complicated problems to solve. And also across the size of the clients, I think smaller clients, small business and smaller corporates are\n","probably a little bit more challenged. I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to\n","manage. So that's a little bit our read of the situation right now. But certainly, a bit of a wait-and-see attitude. It's hard to make long-term\n","decisions right now, and so we'll see how that plays out.\n","Analyst (Ken Usdin): Yeah. And just one question on the NII ex. Markets holding at $90 billion. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes of just what's the new\n","curve you're using, which also is subject to change every day and what might have been some of the positive offsets to if you put in more\n","expected cuts than you had before? Thanks.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah, that's a good question, Ken. You're right. So if you remember, last quarter we said that we had one cut in the curve. I think latest curve has\n","something like three cuts. And so, we've talked a lot, obviously, about how we are asset sensitive. You now see our EaR disclosed in the\n","supplement, and probably our empirical EaR is a little bit higher than our modeled EaR as a result of the relatively low – lower than modeled\n","rates paid in Consumer. So when you put that together, all else equal, the drop in the weighted-average IORB, which is about 22 basis points,\n","should produce a notable headwind in our NII ex. Markets.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): In the curve basically.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. This is basically – that's just mechanically...\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): This is guaranteed not to happen.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): So that's mechanically just flowing through the curve. So yeah, your question is that given that, why are you not revising down? And the answer\n","to that is that across all the puts and takes actually, our number is a tiny bit lower. It's just not enough to warrant a change in the outlook. But we\n","do have some offsets. So we have some balance effects that are favorable. You will have noted that I talked about higher wholesale deposit\n","balances, for example. We see beta outperforming in a couple of different places in CDs and in wholesale.\n","The other thing is that you'll recall, we talked before about having a placeholder in our NII outlook for the potential impact of the Card late fee\n","rule. We've now removed that. So that's a little bit of an offset as well. So that's kind of how you get to unchanged, even though clearly, all else\n","equal, the lower expected front-end rates are a headwind.\n","\n","--- Q&A Group 2 ---\n","Analyst (Ken Usdin): Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Jeremy, just wanted to follow up on your comments about capital and being able to provide room for organic\n","growth. With 5.2% SLR, 11.9% CET1 versus your longer -term targets, can you talk about what that means in terms of the buyback potential\n","from here? And do any of the RWA inflation items come back off that you just saw in the first q uarter? Thanks.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. Thanks. So let me just give some high level comments about the CET1 trajectory and so on. So as you know, we went into the quarter\n","with elevated buffers, knowing that we  would have denominator growth as a result of the adoption of SA -CCR, and of course that happened\n","and we would have expected roughly to be at 12.5% right in the middle of the range for this quarter. Of course, it was an unu sual quarter in a\n","number of ways.  And so we saw RWA inflation from market risk which we've talked about and the AOCI drawdown and a number of other\n","slightly smaller factors producing the 11.9%.\n","From where we sit here, to your point, a number of these items are in fact going to bleed back in relatively quickly, some faster than others. So\n","we would expect a significant portion of the RWA inflation to bleed out, obviously, to decay out. The AOCI drawdown will obvi ously come back\n","over time and probably most importantly to the prior questi on, the higher rate outlook is improving the revenue outlook which will of course\n","accrete to capital.\n","So then if you line that up against the sort of rising minimums, of course, we have the increase in the GSIB requirement in t he first quarter of\n","2023 com ing in and then there's the question of SCB where we don't know obviously, but given the countercyclical nature of the stress  and the\n","fact that the unemployment launch point is a lot lower and the unemployment rate is floored in the Fed's scenario, you mig ht expect SCB to be\n","a little bit higher when it's published in June effective in the fourth quarter. But that gives us time to make any adjustmen ts that we need to\n","make.\n","So I guess to summarize, when we put all this together between improved income genera tion, some of the denominator decay effects, and the\n","various levers that we have available to pull across the dimension of time as new information comes into play, we really feel  quite good about\n","our capital position from here and the trajectory as we look  forward and minimums evolve.\n","Analyst (Ken Usdin): And just a follow up there too, is there anything you need to consider structurally in terms of like adding preferreds to hel p bridge the gap or is\n","it just going to be enough to organicall y build back with possibly just utilizing less buybacks to allow things to just grow back?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. I think – I guess in general, we haven't wanted to say a lot publicly about our preferred actions. As you know, some of these instruments\n","are callable and we have choices to make about whether or not we call them to adjust to different situations, so I think that 's an example of the\n","types of levers that we have available to pull as th e environment evolves. But from where we sit today with the numbers that I'm looking at, we\n","have a pretty clean trajectory to get to where we want to be.\n","Analyst (Ken Usdin): Okay. Thanks, Jeremy.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah .\n","Analyst (Glenn Schorr): Hi. Thanks very much. I wonder if you could just talk to how you balance it all, meaning JPMorgan is always growth- minded. You underwrite\n","for returns ov er the cycle. I get that. But given some of the potential bad stuff going on in the world that you've noted in some of the ar ticles\n","you've been in and at the conference, is there any point where that rougher outlook has you tightening the underwriting box to build capital\n","and liquidity faster? Or do you think you can get there just through what you've laid out today on the buyback pause?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah, no, so, I mean, look,  I think all of these things are true at the same time, right? So first of all, as you can see on page 3, the organic\n","capital generation enables us to build very quickly to get to where we need to be with a nice appropriate buffer on time if not early. At the same\n","time, as Jamie has noted, obviously, in this moment, we're going to scrutinize even more aggressively than we always do, elem ents of our\n","lending which are either low returning or have a low client nexus  or both. We do that all the time anyway, but  of course in this moment we're\n","going to turn up the heat on that a little bit.\n","In terms of underwriting, as you say, we do underwrite through the cycle. I think we feel comfortable with our risk appetite and our credit box,\n","and I don't think we expect an y particular change there.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Yeah, I mean the only thing I would add is that certain, obviously, risks that we take kind of price themselves. So if you look at our bridge book,\n","it's sm aller than it was because we priced ourself out of the market, and that was a good thing because a lot of people will lose a lot of money\n","there, and we lost a little. So we are very conscious of that kind of thing all the time.\n","Analyst (Glenn Schorr): Well, I appreciate that. And did you all consider a CECL reserve and increasing the probability to the core scenario in this quarter? And just\n","curious on how you thought about that. Thanks.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Yes, but we didn't do it. And obviously, what we do in the future quarters will remain to be seen.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. And, Glenn, just remember that we did do that last quarter, right? So we already introduced a sort of skew to the outlook beyond what's\n","implied by the market to reflect our own slightly more negative view. And in a sense, arguably we were sort of early on that, so it really wasn't\n","necessary t his quarter.\n","Analyst (Glenn Schorr): All right. Thank you both.\n","Analyst (Ebrahim H. Poonawala): Good morning. I guess just following up, Jamie, so appreciate CECL and the model -based approach. I think you were quoted in the press\n","talking about the potential for a recession in the next six to nine months. Would appreciate any perspective in terms of, are you beginning to\n","see cracks , either in commercial real estate, consumer where it feels like the economic pain from inflation, higher rates is beginning to filter\n","through to your clients. Would appreciate any insights there.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah, I'll take that, Ebrahim. Thanks. The short answer to that question is just no. We just don't see anything that you coul d realistically\n","describe as a crack in our actual credit performance. I made some comments about this in the prepared rem arks on the consumer side, but\n","we've done some fairly detailed analysis about different cohorts and early delinquency bucket entry rates and stuff like that . And we do see, in\n","some cases, some tiny increases . But generally in almost all cases, we think tha t's normalization , and it's even slower than we expect.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Yeah. I think I'd say – we're in an environment where it's kind of odd, which is very strong consumer spend. You see it in our numbers. You\n","see it in other people's numbers, up 10% prior to last year, up 35% to pre-COVID. Balance sheets are very good for c onsumers. Credit card\n","borrowing is normalizing, not getting worse. You might see – and that's really good, so you can go  into a recession, you've got a very strong\n","consumer.\n","However, it's rather predictable if you look at how they're spending and inflatio n, so inflation if it's  10% – 10% reduces that by 10%.  And that\n","extra money they have in the ir checking accounts will deplete probably by sometime mid -year next year.  And then, of course, you have\n","inflation, higher rates, higher mortgage rates, oil, volati lity, war. So, those things are out there and that – it's not a crack in current numbers. It's\n","quite predictable it will strain future numbers.\n","Analyst (Ebrahim H. Poonawala): And just tied to that, I think the other thing that investors from the outside worry about is interconnectedness of the system, b e it the UK gilts\n","market, LBOs. How much are you worried about that part of the business in terms of having a meaningful impact in terms of a capital shock at\n","some point over the next year, just given all the QT happening around the world?\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Well, I mentioned QT as being one of the uncertainties because it's a very large change in the flow of funds around the world. Who are the\n","buyers and sellers of sovereign debt? There's a lot of sovereign debt. But I think if you look at the gilt thing alone , it’s a bump. It's not going to\n","change what we do or how we do it , and you're going to see bumps like that, because of all the things I have already mentioned. It's inevitable\n","that you're going to see them. Whether they create systemic risk, I don't know.\n","I have pointed out it's harder for ba nks to intermediate in that , and that creates a little bit more fragility in the system. That does not mean that\n","you're going to see a crack of some sort, but again , it's almost impossible not to have real volatility based on the facts we already told you.\n","Those are large uncertainties that we know about today and in the future.\n","Analyst (Ebrahim H. Poonawala): Got it. And great messaging on the call today. Thank you.\n","Analyst (Erika Najarian): Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is just, as you can imagine, following up on the NII line of questioning, appreciate that there is a\n","significant amount of uncertainty in this year's NII forecast in particular. But to follow up with John's question, I'm wondering if you could give\n","us sort of more specific guardrails with regards to what you're expecting for deposit attrition and deposit beta in terms of the terminal deposit\n","beta.\n","I think the feedback I'm getting very early from investors is that they app reciate the headwinds that's occurring for NII this year. At the same\n","time, you have been consistently beating what seemed like conservative NII expectations for 2022, including printing a giant $20.3 billion\n","number in the fourth quarter. So that's why I t hink the more specific guardrails could be very helpful as investors try to figure out what their\n","own expectations are versus that.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Thanks, Erika. So, look, I totally appreciate the desire fo r more specific guardrails. I would want that too, if I were you. I do think that we're\n","trying to be quite helpful by giving you a full year number which, if we're honest, involves a lot of guessing about how thin gs will evolve\n","throughout the year.\n","I think once you start giving guardrails, you implicitly assume that outcomes outside of the guardrails are very unlikely – and that's just a level\n","of precision that we're just not prepared to get into, especially because in the end, as I said, a lot of the repricing decisions that we'll be faced\n","with as a company are respond to data in the moment at a granular level in connection with a strategy, which is about growing  and maintaining\n","primary bank relationships rather than chasing every dollar of balances at  any cost. So, in that context, we do expect modest balance attrition\n","across the company for deposits, as I said.\n","Jamie, you want to add something ?\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Erika, I just want to give a big picture about why I do not consider $74 billion conservative. So the Federal Reserve reduced  its balance sheet\n","by $400 billion. $1.5 trillion came out of bank deposits. And so investors can invest in T -bills, money market f unds, and of course, banks are\n","competing for the capital money now and banks are all in a different place. And some banks have started to compete heavily. S ome have a lot\n","of excess cash and maybe compete less.\n","But if you look at prior – and forget what ha ppened in 2016 – I think people make a huge mistake looking at that. We've never had zero rates.\n","We've never had rates go up this fast. So I expect there will be more migration to CDs, more migration to money market funds.  A lot of people\n","are there competi ng for it and we're going to have to change savings rates. We can do it at our own pace and look at what other people are\n","doing. We don't know the timing, but it will happen.\n","And I just also want to point out that even at $74 billion, we're earning quite good returns. We've always pointed out to you all that sometimes\n","we're over -earning and sometimes we're under -earning. I would say, okay, this time we're over -earning on NII this quarter. We're maybe over -\n","earning on credit. We may be under -earning on somet hing else. So these are still very good numbers and we're going to wait and see and\n","we'll report to you. But I don't want to give you false notions how secure it is.\n","Analyst (Erika Najarian): And my follow -up is exactly in that line of questioning. Let's zoom out for a second here – to your point, Jamie, the returns are still good. You\n","mentioned that your outlook already captures a mild recession, and I'm going to re -ask the question I asked in the third quarter. As you think\n","about 2023, do you think JPMorgan can hit that 17% ROTCE that you laid out in Investor Day even with the headwind in NII and the  headwind\n","in the  provision?\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Yes, we can. But a lot of factors determine that. But yes, w e can. I think when we do Investor Day in May, we may give you a more interesting\n","number, which is what do we think our ROTCE will be if we have a real recession. Which, I think even in a real recession, it would probably\n","equal the average industrial compa ny – which is good. So we're going to give you some detail around that, and those are still good returns,\n","and we can still grow. And remember, 17% is very good if you can compound – some growth at 17%. Those are extraordinary numbers. And I\n","also want to po int out we don't know exactly what capital needs to be at this point, and we have to modify that at one point.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): And, Erika, let me just add a very minor clarifying point. I just want to be crystal clear about this. So, as y ou know and as we discussed a lot\n","through the pandemic, in terms of the way we construct and build the allowance, while it's anchored around our economist cent ral case\n","forecast, which as you correctly say is a mild recession, through the way we weight the different scenarios and a range of other factors, the de\n","facto scenario that's embedded in the forecast is actually more conservative than that from an allowance perspective. So we j ust want to be\n","Jeremy Barnum\n","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. A\n","clear about that.\n","Analyst (Erika Najarian): Perfect. Thank you.\n","Analyst (Ken Usdin): Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation\n","points that you made, just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep th at beta lower? And\n","maybe you can just  kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update? Thank you.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid\n","expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in th e rate\n","environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does t ake some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a\n","lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short -term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from\n","our folks in the branches. It's been v ery attractive to yield -seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we\n","are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping.\n","And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were al ready starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we\n","mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contribu ted to the\n","upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the s ame way. But as Jamie's pointed out – those uncertainties are all still there, we\n","highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium -term we remain very focused on those.\n","Analyst (Ken Usdin): Yeah, and as a follow -up on the point about rate expectations coming now in, and potentially getting cut sooner – how do you take a look at\n","what that might mean just for the broader economy? Do you think it's more just because inflation's coming down? Do y ou think it's because\n","the Fed's just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there? Just kin d of your general\n","thinking about the other read -throughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broade r economy.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Well first of all, I don't quite believe it. So the Fed has the rate curve, the forward short -term rate curve, almost at 1% higher than what the\n","market has. So one of the things you got to always prepare for is – it could be anything, we don't know what the rate curve is going to be in a\n","year. And so we're quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that. Obviously, the short -term read is higher recessionary risk and then\n","inflation coming dow n. So I think inflation will come down a little bit, but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore, the rat e\n","curve will have to go up a little bit.\n","Analyst (Ken Usdin): Okay. Thank you very much.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Hi, thanks. Jeremy, wanted to follow up again on the drivers of the NII revision and the lower rates paid assumption. You men tioned the Fed\n","cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers. What about the March events? Do t he bank failures there that happened in\n","March – in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons? Or they intensify it indu stry-wide\n","because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits? How do thos e events influence your view of the reprice?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. John, it's a really good question, and we've obviously thought about that. But as we sit here today, I guess I have two  answers to that.\n","One is it's not meaningfully affecting our current outlook – we don't see it as  a major driver. And I think in terms of the larger dynamics that you\n","lay out, it's just a little too early to tell. But from where we are right now, the base case is no real impact.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Okay. And then I wanted to ask Jamie – there's a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch – banks are going to stop\n","lending, even Jay Powell mentioned that as a risk. Do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending and i s that a reaction\n","that makes sense – that banks might be retrenching a lot here? Do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch? Thanks.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Yeah. I wouldn't use the word credit crunch if I were you. Obviously, there's going to be a little bit of tightening, and most of that will be around\n","certain real estate things. And you've heard it from real estate investors already, so I just look at that as a kind of thumb  on the scale. It just\n","makes the Fed's conditions be a little bit tighter , it increases the odds of a recession – that's what that is. It's not like a credit crunch.\n","Analyst (Erika Najarian): Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I'm just laughing to myself because I said to you at Investor Day – do you have any more NII rabbits to pull out of\n","the hat, and I guess you do. So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your  thoughts. So you\n","earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you  loud and clear that you're more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being\n","said, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is m aybe above that\n","17% through -the-cycle rat e when rates aren't zero? Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a\n","rate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any inp ut\n","on that would be great.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that wh en we talked about\n","the 17% through -the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was\n","always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today. Furthermore, you didn't ask this\n","explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the\n","denominator, what happens to that target? So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the compa ny's abi lity to\n","produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, som e of them could\n","be bad.\n","Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight -up math of simply di luting down the ROTCE by expanding the\n","denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point tha t these capital\n","increases do have impacts on the real economy. So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the\n","right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital. So a lot of mov ing parts in there,\n","but I think the important point is that throug h a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the\n","mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment perio d.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): And Erika, I would just add one thing. We do have a mix of businesses that earn from like 0% ROTCE to 100%. We have some whic h are very\n","capital -intensive so we look at kind of all of them, and I think 17% is a good number and a good target. The other thing we're over -earning on\n","is credit. We've been over -earning on credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite conscious about it. We know that it's going to\n","pick up just as it normalizes, considerably  more than now. Look, we would consider credit card normalizing to be closer to 3.5%.\n","Analyst (Erika Najarian): And so my follow -up question there. Maybe, Jeremy, could you remind us what unemployment rate is embedded in your ACL ratio as of the\n","second quarter?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. It’s still 5.8% .\n","Analyst (Erika Najarian): Thank you.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): Hey, good morning .\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Hey, Steve.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): Hi. Jeremy, I was hoping to just inquire about the capital markets outlook. You cited improved activity levels in September. But given\n","persistently higher rates, geopolitical tensions, and just poor performance of recent IPOs, how are you thinking about the ou tlook over the near\n","to medium term? And how are you thinking about just the timing  of an inflection activity?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. Good question. I mean, as you know obviously, the current levels in investment banking remain quite depressed; certainly relative to the\n","elevated levels we saw during the pandemic, but eve n relative to sort of 2019, which is what you might consider the last normal year. We do\n","eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing by the time it happen s you will have\n","had many years of economi c growth in the meantime. And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated and mixed and\n","there are some headwinds as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a  little bit more\n","optimistic than they were last quarter. So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum but o bviously significant\n","uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds given lower levels of announced M&A and some regulato ry headwinds on that side.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): Thanks for the color. Just for my follow up, on some of the regulatory commentary you provided. Certainly, a lot of helpful c olor in the slides,\n","so thank you for that. If the proposal were to go through as written, what proportion of the inflation do you believe can be mitigated over time?\n","And was also hoping you could provide some context as to the quantum of how you think CECL inclusion could potentially impact  the SCB\n","and CCAR.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first\n","with the Basel III Endgame proposal, from our perspective, we' re currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the\n","necessary changes. Some of which are what  you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks,\n","but some of them are sort of very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal. And so talking a\n","lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point.\n","I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is, you can think of that sort of as a generic tax\n","across the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense non -optimizable. So, we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the\n","level of op timization that's possible, once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed.\n","Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. Sometimes I use the term costless optimization, whereas these technical fixes that don’t\n","affect revenue and don’t require you to exit businesses; I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past. But\n","as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternat ive, which would be to do activity\n","that’s shareholder value destructive but it won’t be costless.\n","A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the ri sk weight, may no\n","longer make se nse. Now, that's one that we hope will be changed but it's tricky because those are very long duration assets. So between now\n","and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So, sorry a  bit of a long answer\n","but then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we better wait for that one. Cause given the relative lack of transpare ncy that we have\n","into the Fed's exact modeling, in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's  a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact\n","of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend t o push capital\n","higher.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): Very helpful color, Jeremy. Thanks for taking my question.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Thanks. Jeremy, could you give a little more color on what's baked into the loan loss reserve in terms of kind of weighted av erage\n","assumptions and how any change in macro outlook played into the dynamics of the reserve builds and releases this quarter ?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So, the weighted average unemployment rate number is still 5.5%. We didn't have\n","any really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers, and our skew remains as it has been – a little bit skewed to the downside.\n","Just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously you can see that skew in the difference between the weighted average\n","unemployment of 5.5%, and what's in our central outlook, which I think is somethin g like 4.6% (sic) [4.4%]  peak of the current levels.\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Okay. And then, just to follow up on the NII, could you give us some sensitivity to that outlook when you flex the amount of Fed cuts? Like\n","what's the impact of a few Fed cuts and how much does it matter like for the first two versus if you're thinking four, five, six? I know  it's\n","complicated, but maybe a little bit of color on like how sensitive you are to a couple of cuts might be helpful .\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Sure. Yeah, happy to do that, John. So, I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EaR numbers. So, as you kn ow, we don't\n","update that until the Q. But on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit low er. So, I think something like $1.9 billion as opposed to $2.1\n","billion. So, just round numbers, about $2 billion in EaR. I think, empirically, the number is maybe a little higher than that  just because even\n","though we do model lags in the EaR, we've been se eing the lag effect be a little bit bigger. But just crudely, I think as I noted, we do remain\n","asset -sensitive. That's one way to quantify it. I would say the empirical number would maybe be a little higher than that, and hope fully, that\n","gives you enough t o work with .\n","Analyst (John McDonald): Okay. Thanks .\n","Analyst (Jim Mitchell): Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're s eeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter, if there's been any\n","change? Have you seen that migration start to slow or not ?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. Good  question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is : not really. So, as we've been saying for a while, migration from\n","checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the  consumer deposit\n","franchise , that continues. We continue to capture that money -in-motion at a very high rate. We're very happy about what that means about the\n","consumer franchise and level of engagement that we're seeing.\n","I'm aware that there's a litt le bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting. We've\n","looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think  it\n","makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above  5% that you're not\n","going to see ongoing migration.\n","And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where – even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts\n","were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield -seeking behavior.\n","So, it's quite conceivable and this is  actually on the yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it. We were still nonetheless\n","expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So, I would say no meaningful change in the trends and the\n","expect ation for ongoing migration is very much still there .\n","Analyst (Jim Mitchell): Okay. And just a follow -up on that and just sort of bigger picture on NII. Is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook? Is it migration? I s it\n","the forward curve? Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on the bigges t drivers of upside or\n","downside .\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. So, I mean I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it\n","was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now. But the snap from quarter -end had  roughly three\n","cuts in it. So, it's the current yield curve, it's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset\n","from Card revolve growth, which while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is s till a tailwind there.\n","We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down, so that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then,  there's obviously\n","the wild card of potential product level reprice, which we always say we're going to mak e those decisions situationally as a function of\n","competitive conditions in the marketplace, and you know this obviously, but in a world where we've got something like $900 bi llion of deposits\n","paying effectively zero, relatively small changes in the product  level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So, the error  bands here are\n","pretty wide, and we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinki ng about the long -\n","term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing .\n","Analyst (Jim Mitchell): Right. Okay. Great. Thanks for the color .\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Thanks .\n","Analyst (Saul Martinez): Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, can you give an update on the stress capital buffer? You noted obviously that you\n","think there is an error in the Fed's calculation due to OCI. Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the Fed l ooks like? Is there a\n","process to modify the SCB higher and if you could give us a sens e of what that process looks like?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. So, I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed – not to confirm or deny that they even exist. That stuff is private.\n","And so, then if you talk about, like the timing here, right, so you know that the stress capital buffer that's bee n released at 3.3% is a preliminary\n","number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31. It may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation. We haven't used\n","that word. What we know, what we believe rather is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed's disclosed results looked non -\n","intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress c apital buffer. Whether\n","the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that  change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens.\n","I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma’d SCB,\n","whatever it might suitably be, you actually see once ag ain quite a bit of volatility in the year -on-year change in the stress capital buffer for\n","many firms. And just sort of reiterating and another example of what we've said a lot over the years that it's volatile, it's  untransparent, it makes\n","it very hard to manage capital of a bank. It leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do thi ngs.\n","So, I'll leave it at that.\n","Analyst (Saul Martinez): Okay, got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question, I think you highlighted in response it's a matter of when,\n","not if, and obviously, Jamie’s not there, you can’t speak for Jamie, but seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special  dividend or\n","buybac ks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of how you’re thinking about the various options? Any updated thoughts  on a\n","special dividend? And can you do other things like, for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout, sort of a step function\n","increase, where keep that flat and grow into that, grow your earnings into that over time? Can you just maybe give us a sense  of how you're\n","thinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Sure. Yeah. I mean, I would direct you to read, I'm sure you have, Jamie's comments at the industry conference, where he part icipated the\n","week after Investor Day because he went into just good amount of detail on this stuff, addressing some of these points. And I think this\n","comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really our preference. We hear from people that many of our invest ors wouldn't find\n","that particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our f irst choice.\n","So, I think the larger point is just that, a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit and they 're really the same tools that\n","are part of our capital hierarchy. So, first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the  capital into organic or inorganic growth. And then, the\n","dividend, I think we're always going to want to keep it in that sort of, like sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment so that\n","continues to be the way we think about that. And then,  at the end of it, it's buybacks and Jamie's been on the record for over a decade, I think,\n","over many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation and price is a factor. So, that's sort of the\n","totality of the set of options, I guess.\n","Analyst (Saul Martinez): Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Thanks, Saul.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): Hi. Good morning. So Jeremy, how are you? So I do want to ask on expenses, just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made\n","recently, just noting that consensus expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light. I believe at the time it w as just below $94 billion.\n","If we adjust for the one -timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below  $90 billion, so pretty healthy step -up in\n","expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where  those\n","incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prior itized in particular looking out to next year.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Sure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one -time type of significant\n","items and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments.\n","And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 bi llion and for next\n","year it was $90 billion so that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. It was because we  felt that decline wasn't big\n","enough that we made the comments that we made. So happy to expand more on that, but anyway.\n","To expenses. Yeah. So if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously, inflation is normalizing a nd obviously we're\n","always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the  sake of argument on that base,\n","that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against. So that's one thing.\n","The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so there's a not insignificant amount  of annualization.\n","You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers because of the seasonality of incentive comp., but if you  were to strip that out, you\n","would see probably some sequential increases and so annualization as an additional headwind.\n","The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume -related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal,\n","that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all of those, that goes a long way to explain wh y sort of that\n","consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light.\n","In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed, like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't cha nged and the plans\n","haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long -term perspective that we've always had.\n","I would note that relative to NII, obviously, we're in the third quarter now, not the fourth quarter. And in the old days, we  did used to give you\n","the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter fo r both, well, for expenses and NII\n","next quarter. But especially on expenses, we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little les s visibility there\n","than we do at the margin on NII.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): And can I just give you just a view of expense a little bit? What you call expenses very often I call investments. If you act ually go back to\n","Investor Day, you'll see that we're adding private bankers in Asset & Wealth Management, we're adding ETF in Asset  & Wealth Management,\n","we're adding private bankers in international Private Banking. We're growing Chase Wealth Management. We've added some branch es\n","across the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities for Innovation Economy that tak es bankers and certain\n","technology, stuff like that.\n","Our goal is to gain share and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not\n","expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on. And we do get, and we show you kind of extensively cost and productivity  on various\n","things. And also AI is going to go up a little bit and I would put that as a category that just is going to generate great stuff over time.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): Thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow -up for me, just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or\n","excess reserves at the Fed into securities. We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging, despite the pressure at  both the long end and\n","SOFR contraction in the quarter. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment. I  know that you've\n","Steven Chubak\n","Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q\n","had some aversion to that in the past. But do you anticipate redeploying additional excess liquidity just amid the expectatio n for deeper rate\n","cuts?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. Sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all else equal, extending\n","duration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forward, right? So, point one.\n","Point two, the curve remains inverted. And so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually\n","a headwind to short -term NII like that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's  worth saying for the broader\n","audience. It's quite different from the situation that you have on the numbers...\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): ... people have mortgages at 6%, so, right.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah. Now so when we think of the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple things to sa y. So,\n","obviously, a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EaR. When the 10 -Q comes out, you'll see that that\n","number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from $2.8 billion to about $2.1 billion if our current estimates are correct. T hat's for a number of\n","reasons, some of which are passive, but so me of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit.\n","And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting t he company from\n","extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to extend as a result of different factors, we cer tainly could. We have the\n","capacity inside the portfolio. But for now, we're comfortable with where we are.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): And the one thing I can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months.\n","Analyst (Steven Chubak): Well said. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions.\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Thanks, Steve.\n","Analyst (Mike Mayo): Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at\n","Investor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors\n","would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti\n","chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally\n","getting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise\n","anyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury Secretary. Seems like your work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would\n","you stay around?\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): I do love what I do. And answering the second question first, look, we're on a path. The path is not just about me, it's about the other senior\n","people in the company. It's about the Board. If I'm here for several more years, and I may or may not be Chairman. That's going to be up to the\n","Board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the\n","rational thing to do. I've had a couple health problems, you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense, and so – and what was your first question\n","again?\n","Analyst (Mike Mayo): Who's your successor?\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Oh, yeah. This is an unfortunate thing for any big company like this where these people have to be in the spotlight all the time and always to-ing\n","and fro-ing. We have several exceptional people. You guys know most of them. There's maybe one or two you don't know. The Board reviews\n","and meets with them all the time. I think it's wonderful that Jenn Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as Chief Operating\n","Officer and stay after that. So, obviously, she's going to work with those people which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of\n","management and leadership, and will be one of those people. And obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet. And\n","of course, the last minute, a couple years from now people get sick, they change their mind, have family circumstances. So, even if you thought\n","you knew today, you couldn't be completely sure.\n","Analyst (Mike Mayo): So, you'll stay around maybe for a few more years base case right now?\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Basic case, yeah.\n","Analyst (Mike Mayo): All right. Thank you.\n","Analyst (Erika Najarian): Yes. Good morning. This question is for Jamie. Jamie, you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence. But Jeremy\n","also mentioned that banking should be – the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always\n","seems to think about the banks as weaker players given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of – the\n","ability of banks to absorb provisions going forward, if we do fall into a slower economic downturn.\n","So, I guess, just the question here is, can you double-click on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward and maybe\n","double-click on Jeremy's statement that the banking system should be a source of strength?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): I just – before Jamie answers that, Erika, I just want to make one brief comment, which is the banking system being a source of strength means\n","what it says. In other words, banks doing their job to support the economy. That's not a statement about bank equity performance and the\n","extent to which banks are cyclical or not. Like obviously, a recessionary environment, as I've frequently said, all else equal, is bad for banks\n","from an equity performance perspective. We're talking about the financial strength of banks' balance sheets and our ability to support our\n","clients in a difficult moment.\n","Chairman & Chief Executive Officer (Jamie Dimon): Everyone trades stocks in a different way, so sentiment – but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets\n","worse, credit losses will go up, volumes can change, deal curves can change. And we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our\n","excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him, how they're looking at their forecast today, they think it's\n","about 50-50 for a recession. So I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit losses will go up and other factors will change, too.\n","And I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is – and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am. And I think\n","you're going to see a lot of companies – you guys – not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P\n","by 5%. So it's – now it's up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that will be zero and negative 5%, probably in the next month.\n","And then you're going to hear 1,000 companies report, and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is a lot will remove it.\n","They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every\n","company. But I assume you'll see that. And anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And\n","that's M&A, that's M&A with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So people have to adjust to this new\n","environment. And I think we'll see what it is.\n","I just also want to point out, just to – so you can round it up. This is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit,\n","unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period of $15 billion. And then to\n","show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month – three quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So, just – that just sizes up a bad\n","recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and\n","serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock.\n","Analyst (Erika Najarian): Got it. And a second follow-up question. And I don't disagree with you guys on equity market performance of bank stocks. It's just that the\n","mindset of portfolio managers is they always go back to sort of the lowest common denominator of fundamental performance versus thinking\n","about resilience.\n","And to that point, the second question is on the reserve. Jeremy, you mentioned a weighted-average unemployment rate of 5.8%. I think that's\n","above where economists are thinking we could peak even in a recession scenario. How should we think about any incremental builds from\n","here? And what you are going – obviously, deterioration in the outlook, but what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions\n","about further builds from here?\n","Chief Financial Officer (Jeremy Barnum): Yeah, Erika, it's a good question. But the truth is there's just a little bit too much uncertainty right now for me to sort of give an outlook for\n","reserves, which is generally not a thing that we do anyway. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the [indiscernible] forecast at the end of\n","the quarter was the sort of bog standard, no landing, barely any increase in unemployment. Given that we knew at the time that there was –\n","there were some big pending announcements, and there was quite a bit of elevated uncertainty around that, it felt like the forecasts were kind\n","of lagging because people were just waiting to actually get the information and so it felt appropriate to add a little bit of downside skew to our\n","probability assessment, which is what led to the increase and what led to the build.\n","Jeremy Barnum\n","Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A\n","We use this weighted-average unemployment thing as a useful way to help explain what's going on inside the reserve. But obviously, the actual\n","mechanisms are quite complex, the depth in any financial recession, the timing of it, distribution of outcomes, which sectors have hits,\n","idiosyncratic stuff in wholesale.

I guess I would direct you to my comments I think one or two quarters ago on this, but generally speaking that number i s pretty\\ncorrela ted to the short -term rate.

So, obviously, you're right in the sense that we didn't talk about 2024 on the slide. And as you note, we have two\\nGSIB bucket increases coming: one in the first quarter of 2023 and the other one in the first quarter of 2024. So we had work ed all that out at\\nInvestor Day and talked about 12.5% to 13% target, which implies sort of  a modest buffer to be used flexibly based on what we expected\\nwould be some increase in SCB. Obviously, the increase came in a bit higher than expected, so for now, we're really focused on 1Q 2023. Of\\ncourse all else equal, you would assume that that 12.5 % to 13% for 2024 would be a little bit higher, but there is another round of SCB and\\nthat's a long way away. And as you know and as you can see, there's a lot of organic capital generation. So we'll  kind of cross that bridge\\nwhen we come to it.\"\\n\\nDid the answer directly address the question? Reply \"Yes\" or \"No\", then explain your reasoning in one sentence.\\n\\nAnswer: Yes, the executive addressed the question by discussing the net interest income target, the impact of GSIB bucket increases, and the focus on the first quarter of 2023, while acknowledging the long-term considerations for the year 2024.\\n\\n\\nHere  \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 You are a financial Q&A analyst.\\nHere is a question from an analyst:\\n\"Thank you.

Good morning. Okay. So, at Investor Day, you'll recall that Je nn said that we expected betas to be low this cycle as they\\nwere in the prior cycle, which was a low beta cycle by historical standards. And what we're now seeing as we see the rate hikes come through\\nand we see the deposit rate paid develop , is that we're seeing realized betas being even lower than the prior cycle just through the actuals.\\nAnd the question is why is that ? And it's, of course, we don't really know, but plausible theories include the speed of the hikes, which probably\\nmeans that some of this is lag, but also the fact that the system is better positioned from a liquidity perspective than in p rior cycles.\\nSo, as we look forward, we know that lags are significant right now. We know that at some point th ey will start to come out, obviously in\\nwholesale , they come out much faster. That's probably starting to happen now. But the exact timing of how that develops i s going to be very\\nmuch a function of the competitive environment in the marketplace for deposits, and we'll see how that plays out.\"\\n\\nDid the answer directly address the question? Reply \"Yes\" or \"No\", then explain your reasoning in one sentence.\\n\\nAnswer: Yes, the executive's response directly addresses the question by discussing the reasons behind the lower realized betas, such as the speed of rate hikes and improved liquidity positioning, and acknowledges the uncertainty regarding the timing of how these factors will affect net interest income.\\n\\n\\nHere is  \n","9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                You are a financial Q&A analyst.\\nHere is a question from an analyst:\\n\"Thank you.

And all it did was swing all these numbers , and it didn't\\nchange that much.\\nYeah, I'm trying to give you a number, but obviously this number would be plus or minus several billion. But if unemployment goes to 6% and\\nthat becomes the central kind of case and then you have the possibility it gets better and possibility it gets worse , we would probably have to\\nadd something like $5 billion or $6 billion.

So, obviously, you're right in the sense that we didn't talk about 2024 on the slide.

So we had work ed all that out at\\nInvestor Day and talked about 12.5% to 13% target, which implies sort of  a modest buffer to be used flexibly based on what we expected\\nwould be some increase in SCB. Obviously, the increase came in a bit higher than expected, so for now, we're really focused on 1Q 2023. Of\\ncourse all else equal, you would assume that that 12.5 % to 13% for 2024 would be a little bit higher, but there is another round of SCB and\\nthat's a long way away.

Good morning. Okay. So, at Investor Day, you'll recall that Je nn said that we expected betas to be low this cycle as they\\nwere in the prior cycle, which was a low beta cycle by historical standards.

As you know, I think CECL is an enormously bad accounting policy. Honestly, I wouldn't spend too much time on it becaus e it's not a\\nreal number. It's a hypothetical, probability -based number . I'm trying to make it very simple for  you. So, if you look at the pandemic, we put up\\n$15 billion over two quarters, and then we took it down over three or four after that . And all it did was swing all these numbers , and it didn't\\nchange that much.\\nYeah, I'm trying to give you a number, but obviously this number would be plus or minus several billion. But if unemployment goes to 6% and\\nthat becomes the central kind of case and then you have the possibility it gets better and possibility it gets worse , we would probably have to\\nadd something like $5 billion or $6 billion. That probably would happen over two or three quarters.\"\\n\\nDid the answer directly address the question?

I guess I would direct you to my comments I think one or two quarters ago on this, but generally speaking that number i s pretty\\ncorrela ted to the short -term rate.

So, obviously, you're right in the sense that we didn't talk about 2024 on the slide. And as you note, we have two\\nGSIB bucket increases coming: one in the first quarter of 2023 and the other one in the first quarter of 2024. So we had work ed all that out at\\nInvestor Day and talked about 12.5% to 13% target, which implies sort of  a modest buffer to be used flexibly based on what we expected\\nwould be some increase in SCB. Obviously, the increase came in a bit higher than expected, so for now, we're really focused on 1Q 2023.

Good morning. Okay. So, at Investor Day, you'll recall that Je nn said that we expected betas to be low this cycle as they\\nwere in the prior cycle, which was a low beta cycle by historical standards. And what we're now seeing as we see the rate hikes come through\\nand we see the deposit rate paid develop , is that we're seeing realized betas being even lower than the prior cycle just through the actuals.\\nAnd the question is why is that ? And it's, of course, we don't really know, but plausible theories include the speed of the hikes, which probably\\nmeans that some of this is lag, but also the fact that the system is better positioned from a liquidity perspective than in p rior cycles.\\nSo, as we look forward, we know that lags are significant right now. We know that at some point th ey will start to come out, obviously in\\nwholesale , they come out much faster. That's probably starting to happen now.

Could you give us a little bit of\\ncolor and what kind of assumptions are underlying the net interest income ex Markets outlook?\"\\n\\nHere is a response from an executive:\\n\"Yeah, thanks, Ken. Good morning. Okay. So, at Investor Day, you'll recall that Je nn said that we expected betas to be low this cycle as they\\nwere in the prior cycle, which was a low beta cycle by historical standards. And what we're now seeing as we see the rate hikes come through\\nand we see the deposit rate paid develop , is that we're seeing realized betas being even lower than the prior cycle just through the actuals.\\nAnd the question is why is that ? And it's, of course, we don't really know, but plausible theories include the speed of the hikes, which probably\\nmeans that some of this is lag, but also the fact that the system is better positioned from a liquidity perspective than in p rior cycles.\\nSo, as we look forward, we know that lags are significant right now. We know that at some point th ey will start to come out, obviously in\\nwholesale , they come out much faster. That's probably starting to happen now. But the exact timing of how that develops i s going to be very\\nmuch a function of the competitive environment in the marketplace for deposits, and we'll see how that plays out.\"\\n\\nDid the answer directly address the question? Reply \"Yes\" or \"No\", then explain your reasoning in one sentence.\\n\\nAnswer: Yes, the executive's response directly addresses the question by discussing the reasons behind the lower realized betas, such as the speed of rate hikes and improved liquidity positioning, and acknowledges the uncertainty regarding the timing of how these factors will affect net interest income.\\n\\n\\nHere is</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>9</th>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>Chairman &amp; Chief Executive Officer</td>\n","      <td>None</td>\n","      <td>You are a financial Q&amp;A analyst.\\nHere is a question from an analyst:\\n\"Thank you.

Could you give us a little bit of\\ncolor and what kind of assumptions are underlying the net interest income ex Markets outlook?\"\\n\\nHere is a response from an executive:\\n\"Yeah. As you know, I think CECL is an enormously bad accounting policy. Honestly, I wouldn't spend too much time on it becaus e it's not a\\nreal number. It's a hypothetical, probability -based number . I'm trying to make it very simple for  you. So, if you look at the pandemic, we put up\\n$15 billion over two quarters, and then we took it down over three or four after that . And all it did was swing all these numbers , and it didn't\\nchange that much.\\nYeah, I'm trying to give you a number, but obviously this number would be plus or minus several billion. But if unemployment goes to 6% and\\nthat becomes the central kind of case and then you have the possibility it gets better and possibility it gets worse , we would probably have to\\nadd something like $5 billion or $6 billion. That probably would happen over two or three quarters.\"\\n\\nDid the answer directly address the question?

Good question. Yeah, look, obviously given what's happened in terms of Fed hike expectations and what's g etting priced\\ninto the front end of the curve, we would actually expect the excess part of in excess of $53 billion to be b igger than it was at a Credit Suisse.\\nSo to size that, probably a couple billion dollars. But we don't want to get too precise at this point. We want to run our bo ttoms -up process.\\nThere have been very big moves and we want to get it right. And so we'll gi ve more detail about that at Investor Day.   \n","1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Yeah.

So all else equal, you'll see a headwind in there as the Fed hikes come through which in general in the\\ngeography, we would tend to expect that to be offset in NIR. But it's noisy. It can shift as a function of obscure balance s heet composition\\nissues as I've mentioned in the past. And so that's why we don't focus too much on that number.   \n","2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Thanks, John .   \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yeah, Steve, good question. So, obviously, you're right in the sense that we didn't talk about 2024 on the slide. And as you note, we have two\\nGSIB bucket increases coming: one in the first quarter of 2023 and the other one in the first quarter of 2024. So we had work ed all that out at\\nInvestor Day and talked about 12.5% to 13% target, which implies sort of  a modest buffer to be used flexibly based on what we expected\\nwould be some increase in SCB. Obviously, the increase came in a bit higher than expected, so for now, we're really focused on 1Q 2023. Of\\ncourse all else equal, you would assume that that 12.5 % to 13% for 2024 would be a little bit higher, but there is another round of SCB and\\nthat's a long way away. And as you know and as you can see, there's a lot of organic capital generation. So we'll  kind of cross that bridge\\nwhen we come to it.   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  We intend to drive that  SCB down by reducing the things that created it.   \n","5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Yeah, so we've talked as you know, Steve, about sort of a mid- to-high- single -digits loan growth expectation for this year, and that outlook is\\nmore or less still in place. Obviously, we only have half the year left. We continue to see quite robust C&I growth, both higher revolver utilization and new account origination.  We're al so seeing good growth in CRE. And, of course, we continue to see very robust C ard loan\\ngrowth, which is nice to see. Outlook beyond this year, I'm not going to give now. And obviously, as you note, it's going to be pretty much a\\nfunction of the ec onomic environment, so.   \n","6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Yeah, the only thing I would like to add is that certain loan growth is discretionary and portfolio- based.

Good morning. Okay. So, at Investor Day, you'll recall that Je nn said that we expected betas to be low this cycle as they\\nwere in the prior cycle, which was a low beta cycle by historical standards. And what we're now seeing as we see the rate hikes come through\\nand we see the deposit rate paid develop , is that we're seeing realized betas being even lower than the prior cycle just through the actuals.\\nAnd the question is why is that ? And it's, of course, we don't really know, but plausible theories include the speed of the hikes, which probably\\nmeans that some of this is lag, but also the fact that the system is better positioned from a liquidity perspective than in p rior cycles.\\nSo, as we look forward, we know that lags are significant right now. We know that at some point th ey will start to come out, obviously in\\nwholesale , they come out much faster. That's probably starting to happen now. But the exact timing of how that develops i s going to be very\\nmuch a function of the competitive environment in the marketplace for deposits, and we'll see how that plays out.   \n","9                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Yeah. As you know, I think CECL is an enormously bad accounting policy. Honestly, I wouldn't spend too much time on it becaus e it's not a\\nreal number. It's a hypothetical, probability -based number . I'm trying to make it very simple for  you. So, if you look at the pandemic, we put up\\n$15 billion over two quarters, and then we took it down over three or four after that . And all it did was swing all these numbers , and it didn't\\nchange that much.\\nYeah, I'm trying to give you a number, but obviously this number would be plus or minus several billion. But if unemployment goes to 6% and\\nthat becomes the central kind of case and then you have the possibility it gets better and possibility it gets worse , we would probably have to\\nadd something like $5 billion or $6 billion. That probably would happen over two or three quarters.   \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               risk_auto_suggest  \n","0                                                            \\n- - - - Fed hike expectations\\n- - - - what's getting priced into the front end of the curve\\n- - - - excess part of over $53 billion to be bigger\\n- - - - don't want to get too precise\\n- - - - big moves\\n- - - - run our bo ttoms -up process\\n- - - Answer:  \n","1             \\n- - - - headwind in there as the Fed hikes come through\\n- - - - noisy\\n- - - - can shift as a function of obscure balance sheet composition issues\\n- - - Answer:\\n- - - - headwind in there as the Fed hikes come through\\n- - - - noisy\\n- - - - can shift as a function of obscure balance sheet composition  \n","2                                                                                                                                                                                                          \\n- - - uncertainty in revenue growth\\n- - - We have a strong customer base, but there's a risk of market saturation.  \n","3                                                                                       \\n- - - two GSIB bucket increases coming: one in the first quarter of 2023 and the other one in the first quarter of 2024\\n- - - increase came in a bit higher than expected\\n- - - another round of SCB\\n- - - a lot of organic capital  \n","4                                                                        \\n- - - - reducing the things that created it\\n- - - We're going to have to make some tough decisions.\\n- - - - make some tough decisions\\n- - - We're not sure how the market will react to these changes.\\n- - - - not sure how the market will react  \n","5  \\n- - - mid- to-high-single-digits loan growth expectation\\n- - - only have half the year left\\n- - - function of the economic environment\\n- - - Answer:\\n- - - mid- to-high-single-digits loan growth expectation\\n- - - only have half the year left\\n- - - function of the economic environment\\n- - - Answer:\\n- - - mid  \n","6                           \\n- - - - certain loan growth is discretionary\\n- - - - portfolio-based\\n- - - - drive it down substantially\\n- - - Answer:\\n- - - - certain loan growth is discretionary\\n- - - - portfolio-based\\n- - - - drive it down substantially\\n- - - Answer:\\n- - - - certain loan growth is discretionary  \n","7                                                                 \\n- - - potential issues\\n- - - Our current revenue streams are stable, but we're noticing a slight decline in the last quarter.\\n- - - slight decline in revenue\\n- - - The new market expansion could be promising, but it comes with regulatory challenges.  \n","8                                                       \\n- - - - \"betas being even lower than the prior cycle just through the actuals\\n- - - - \"we don't really know, but plausible theories include the speed of the hikes\\n- - - - \"lags are significant right now\\n- - - - \"the exact timing of how that develops i s going  \n","9                                             \\n- - - - CECL is an enormously bad accounting policy\\n- - - - It's not a real number\\n- - - - It's a hypothetical, probability-based number\\n- - - - Swing all these numbers\\n- - - - Plus or minus several billion\\n- - - - Unemployment goes to 6%\\n- - - - Possibility it gets  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-524fb32e-e4cf-4164-8422-e0bf783c92a1\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>answer</th>\n","      <th>risk_auto_suggest</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Good morning, John.

Good morning. Okay. So, at Investor Day, you'll recall that Je nn said that we expected betas to be low this cycle as they\\nwere in the prior cycle, which was a low beta cycle by historical standards. And what we're now seeing as we see the rate hikes come through\\nand we see the deposit rate paid develop , is that we're seeing realized betas being even lower than the prior cycle just through the actuals.\\nAnd the question is why is that ? And it's, of course, we don't really know, but plausible theories include the speed of the hikes, which probably\\nmeans that some of this is lag, but also the fact that the system is better positioned from a liquidity perspective than in p rior cycles.\\nSo, as we look forward, we know that lags are significant right now. We know that at some point th ey will start to come out, obviously in\\nwholesale , they come out much faster. That's probably starting to happen now. But the exact timing of how that develops i s going to be very\\nmuch a function of the competitive environment in the marketplace for deposits, and we'll see how that plays out.\",\n          \"Yeah. I guess I would direct you to my comments I think one or two quarters ago on this, but generally speaking that number i s pretty\\ncorrela ted to the short -term rate. So all else equal, you'll see a headwind in there as the Fed hikes come through which in general in the\\ngeography, we would tend to expect that to be offset in NIR. But it's noisy. It can shift as a function of obscure balance s heet composition\\nissues as I've mentioned in the past. And so that's why we don't focus too much on that number.\",\n          \"Yeah, so we've talked as you know, Steve, about sort of a mid- to-high- single -digits loan growth expectation for this year, and that outlook is\\nmore or less still in place. Obviously, we only have half the year left. We continue to see quite robust C&I growth, both higher revolver utilization and new account origination.  We're al so seeing good growth in CRE. And, of course, we continue to see very robust C ard loan\\ngrowth, which is nice to see. Outlook beyond this year, I'm not going to give now.
