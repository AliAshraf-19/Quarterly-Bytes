0,1,John E. McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Thank you. Morning, Jeremy. Was wondering about the net interest income outlook, I know it sounds like we'll get more at Inve stor Day, but
it's very similar to what you gave in mid-February and obviously rate expectations have advanced since then. Could you give us a little bit of
color and what kind of assumptions are underlying the net interest income ex Markets outlook?",2022,1
1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Good morning, John. Good question. Yeah, look, obviously given what's happened in terms of Fed hike expectations and what's g etting priced
into the front end of the curve, we would actually expect the excess part of in excess of $53 billion to be b igger than it was at a Credit Suisse.
So to size that, probably a couple billion dollars. But we don't want to get too precise at this point. We want to run our bo ttoms -up process.
There have been very big moves and we want to get it right. And so we'll gi ve more detail about that at Investor Day.",2022,1
2,1,John E. McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Okay. And as my follow up, could you give us some thoughts about the markets related NII? What things should we think about t here, whether
it's seasonality or how it's affected by rising rates?",2022,1
3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I guess I would direct you to my comments I think one or two quarters ago on this, but generally speaking that number i s pretty
correla ted to the short -term rate. So all else equal, you'll see a headwind in there as the Fed hikes come through which in general in the
geography, we would tend to expect that to be offset in NIR. But it's noisy. It can shift as a function of obscure balance s heet composition
issues as I've mentioned in the past. And so that's why we don't focus too much on that number.",2022,1
4,1,John E. McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,Okay. Thanks.,2022,1
5,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, John .",2022,1
0,2,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Jeremy, just wanted to follow up on your comments about capital and being able to provide room for organic
growth. With 5.2% SLR, 11.9% CET1 versus your longer -term targets, can you talk about what that means in terms of the buyback potential
from here? And do any of the RWA inflation items come back off that you just saw in the first q uarter? Thanks.",2022,1
1,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks. So let me just give some high level comments about the CET1 trajectory and so on. So as you know, we went into the quarter
with elevated buffers, knowing that we  would have denominator growth as a result of the adoption of SA -CCR, and of course that happened
and we would have expected roughly to be at 12.5% right in the middle of the range for this quarter. Of course, it was an unu sual quarter in a
number of ways.  And so we saw RWA inflation from market risk which we've talked about and the AOCI drawdown and a number of other
slightly smaller factors producing the 11.9%.
From where we sit here, to your point, a number of these items are in fact going to bleed back in relatively quickly, some faster than others. So
we would expect a significant portion of the RWA inflation to bleed out, obviously, to decay out. The AOCI drawdown will obvi ously come back
over time and probably most importantly to the prior questi on, the higher rate outlook is improving the revenue outlook which will of course
accrete to capital.
So then if you line that up against the sort of rising minimums, of course, we have the increase in the GSIB requirement in t he first quarter of
2023 com ing in and then there's the question of SCB where we don't know obviously, but given the countercyclical nature of the stress  and the
fact that the unemployment launch point is a lot lower and the unemployment rate is floored in the Fed's scenario, you mig ht expect SCB to be
a little bit higher when it's published in June effective in the fourth quarter. But that gives us time to make any adjustmen ts that we need to
make.
So I guess to summarize, when we put all this together between improved income genera tion, some of the denominator decay effects, and the
various levers that we have available to pull across the dimension of time as new information comes into play, we really feel  quite good about
our capital position from here and the trajectory as we look  forward and minimums evolve.",2022,1
2,2,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,"And just a follow up there too, is there anything you need to consider structurally in terms of like adding preferreds to hel p bridge the gap or is
it just going to be enough to organicall y build back with possibly just utilizing less buybacks to allow things to just grow back?",2022,1
3,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I think – I guess in general, we haven't wanted to say a lot publicly about our preferred actions. As you know, some of these instruments
are callable and we have choices to make about whether or not we call them to adjust to different situations, so I think that 's an example of the
types of levers that we have available to pull as th e environment evolves. But from where we sit today with the numbers that I'm looking at, we
have a pretty clean trajectory to get to where we want to be.",2022,1
4,2,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Okay. Thanks, Jeremy.",2022,1
5,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah .,2022,1
0,3,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,Hi. Good morning.,2022,1
1,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Morning, Betsy.",2022,1
2,3,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"I had a question for Jamie. In your annual letter, you mentioned how you expect to achieve double -digit market share over time in payments.
And what I wanted to understand is if you could unpack that a little bit because when I look at payments, you've got a lot of different sleeves.
For example, in consumer credit card, you're at 20%, 25%. In treasury, I think you're at 7%. So could you give us a sense as to where you
think you are in this total payments category you're talking about, what you're expecting in terms of drivers to get to doubl e-digit and what kind
of timeframe you're thinking about there? Thanks.",2022,1
3,3,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Of ficer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, Betsy, that number, the double -digit, relating just to wholesale payments, not to consumer payments, which obviously we already
have a fairly significant share. And we've gone from 4.5% to something a little bit nor th of 7% over the last five years. And we're just building
out, and I gave some examples. We'll not give a lot when you have Investor Day coming up. We're building all the things we ne ed, real -time
payments, certain blockchain type things, wallets, there's  a couple acquisitions that are building out our wholesale capabilities to do a far
better job for clients globally around the world and supported by what I would say is very good cyber risk controls which cli ents really need too,
by the way. So it's kind of across the board. It's nothing mystical about it. But it's an area we want to win in.",2022,1
4,3,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Okay. And getting to double digits is over the same kind of timeframe, the same pace going from 4% to 7%? Or you think you can accelerate
that? Because I see what's...",2022,1
5,3,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,I wasn't meaning to put a timeframe on it. But I would say five years. You'll get more update on this at Investor Day.,2022,1
6,3,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Okay. And then just the follow up here is on the NII outlook where you indicated the curve suggests the plus side, and is it a couple of billion.
And I guess the question I have is, historically you've been looking to reinvest that benefit from rising rates. You did that last cycle as well.
What I'm hearing is that maybe you don't want to size it for us right now today because you plan on investing it and explaini ng that at Investor
Day. Is that a fair take away?",2022,1
7,3,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"No, no, no.",2022,1
8,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,No.,2022,1
9,3,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"We don't look at it that way, like we're reinvesting NII. The investing stuff we look at all the time. We're investing a lot of money for the future
kind of across the board. But that's not why he's saying –",2022,1
10,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, I think fundamentally, we have had confidence in delivering our 17% ROTCE through the cycle. We've talked a lit tle bit over the
last couple of quarters about, at the time, some short -term headwinds to that mostly as a function of the rate environment and a couple of
other things. The investment plan is a strategic plan that recognizes that sort of confidence in the 17%. The fact that that moment may be
getting pulled forward as a result of the Fed's reaction  to the economy has no impact on how we think about spending.",2022,1
11,3,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,Okay . Great. Thanks for that.,2022,1
0,4,Steven Ch ubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,Hey. Good morning. So…,2022,1
1,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Hi Steve.,2022,1
2,4,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"...wanted to start off with a question on QT. In the past, you've spoke about the linkage between Fed balance sheet reduction and deposit
outflow expectation for yourselves and the industry. And with the Fed just outlining a more aggressive glide path for balance  sheet reduction,
how should we be thinking about deposit o utflow risk? Any views on how betas may differ versus last cycle given a more aggressive pace of
Fed tightening?",2022,1
3,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hey, Steve. So this is a fun question. So let's nerd out a little bit. And I'm sure Jamie will jump in.",2022,1
4,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,And then I’ll simplify for you.,2022,1
5,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, exactly. Okay. So look, I think we've talked a little about what happened in the prior cycle, right? So you had QE, and then you had big
expansion in bank deposits, just some wide expansion. And then at the tail end of that cycle, you had RRP come in. And then R RP has gotten
sort of quite big as QE fin ished. And so now as you look at potentially kind of running that whole thing in reverse, you might actually expect
that the first thing that would happen is that RRP would get drained and only later would bank deposits start to shrink.
But I think you co rrectly point out some of the nuances in the Fed minutes. And when you sort of combine all the effects together, you realize
that there's a lot of interacting forces here. And it's really, I think, very intelligent people differ on their predictions about what's going to happen
here. And just to outline a couple of those.
So it's worth noting for starters that, in general, industry -wide loan growth outlook is quite robust and that should be a tailwind for system -wide
deposit growth. So as you note, yeah, QT will start in May, in all likelihood per the minutes, headwind. Then you just have to look at what's
going to happen in the front end of the curve particularly in bills. So the Treasury has to make decisions about weighted ave rage maturity and
what makes sense there. There's obviously a little bit of shortage, of short -dated collateral in the market right now. So, that might argue for
wanting more supply there. The Fed has to make decisions about portfolio management. They talked in the minutes abo ut using bill maturities
to fill in gaps and so on and so forth. And so those things are going to interact in various ways.
I think one thing that's worth noting though is that if you wind up in the state of the world where bank deposits drain soone r than  people might
have otherwise thought, in all likelihood, that's going to be the lower value, non -operating type deposits. So in any case, we'll see.
But to simplify it for a second, our base case remains modest growth and deposits for us as a company and just pivoting away for a second
from the system to us. From a share perspective, we've taken share in retail deposits, and we feel great about that. And in w holesale, we've
had some nice wins and a nice pipeline of deals there. So that's the current thinki ng on that topic.",2022,1
6,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So the answer is we don't know, okay. And you guys should read economists' reports, but the fact is initially it probably won 't come out of
deposits. Over time, it will come out of wholesale and then maybe consumer. We're prepared for that. It doesn't actually mean that much to us
in the short run. And the beta effectively, we don't expect to be different from what it was in the past. There are a lot of pluses and mi nuses.
You can argue a whole bunch of different ways, but the fact is it won't be that much different, at least the first 100 basis point increase.",2022,1
7,4,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"No, that's really helpful color. Thanks for allowing us to nerd out with you guys on that. Just one more topic or follow up, I should say. Jamie,
just in the shareholder letter, you had spoken about how the market is underestimating the number of Fed hikes that might be needed to curb
inflation. What's your expect ation around the level of Fed tightening? I know it's difficult to make such predictions, but maybe if you could just
help us understand given your own rate outlook how that's informing how you're managing excess liquidity, given the significa nt capacity t hat
you have to redeploy some of those proceeds into higher yielding securities.",2022,1
8,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So I think the implied curve now is like 2.5% at the end of the year and maybe 3% at the end of 2023. Look, no one knows. Obviously,
everyone does their forecast. I think it's going to be more than that, okay. I'll give you a million different reasons why be cause of inflation, and
we just talked about deposits. And we've never been through, ever, QT like this. So this is a new thing for the world. And I think it's more
substantially important than other people think because the huge change of flows of funds is going to create as people change  their
investment portfolios. We're going to be fine beca use we're going to serve the hell out of our customers and gain share.
So what does it do for JPMorgan Chase? JPMorgan Chase will be fine. We have plenty of capital, plenty of growth – we have great margins.
We already have the returns we want and all the  things like that. So I would just be cautious, I think we should expect these volatile markets.
Again, that's okay for us. And the Fed – we just think the Fed needs to do what they need to do to try to manage this economy and try to get to
a soft landing if possible.",2022,1
9,4,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,And any appetite to deploy the excess liquidity?,2022,1
10,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"No, don’t expect that.",2022,1
11,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah . Okay. Yeah we can leave it there.,2022,1
12,4,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,Okay. Thanks so much.,2022,1
0,5,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Hi. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk through the changes in the macro assumptions to capture that downside risk in CECL assumptions.
What I want to get to is where we came from, where we're at now, and then we can impose our thoughts on each quarter as we go...",2022,1
1,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Guys, I don't want to spend a lot of time on CECL, okay. I think it's a complete waste of time. Basically, all we said is the chance of a
adverse or severe adverse event is 10% higher than it was before. That's all we did, very basic. And that led to...",2022,1
2,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"It really is that simple, Glenn.",2022,1
3,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And we don't know – and it's a guess. It's probability weighted, hypothetical, multiyear scenarios that we do the best we can, but to spend a lot
of time on earnings calls about CECL swings is a waste of tim e. It's got nothing to do with the underlying business.
Charge -offs are extraordinarily good, as a matter of fact, way better than they should be. I mean, middle market 1 basis point; Cred it Card 1.5.
We would have told you in the past that the best they' ll ever be is 2.5. So credit's very good. That'll get worse. NII is going to get much better.
Things are going to normalize. We're still earning 16% or 17% on tangible equity. And obviously, you have really – yeah.",2022,1
4,5,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,Yeah. The 10% is what I wanted because your guess is better than my guess. So I appreciate that.,2022,1
5,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Glenn, with all due respect, I do not believe it is.",2022,1
6,5,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore  ISI,"Okay. We'll have a pinky bet. So I think you might have just answered, but I want to make sure I ask it explicitly. The follo w up I have on credit,
and I know it's in much better shape and it depends on the go forward, but are you seeing any stress es in the levered parts of the debt
markets, meaning levered loans, high -yield, CLO, private credit? Anything in there that makes you turn a side eye?",2022,1
7,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Just spread widening and a little bit less liquidity.,2022,1
8,5,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,That doesn’t sound so bad.,2022,1
9,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. No. I mean, Glenn, I think, look, no one likes to be complacent about this type of stuff. And obviously, in this environment, everyone's
looking very closely everywhere for any risks and trying to see around the corner. But as of right now, we're really not seei ng anything of
concern in the kind of spot metrics, so to speak.",2022,1
10,5,Glenn Scho rr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Maybe the last quickie on credit is just with everybody having a job and there's wage inflation and excess cash, are there an y buckets of the
income that you're seeing the early -stage delinquencies picking up?",2022,1
11,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"In short, no. It is an interesting question as you look across our customer base, particularly in Card, and sort of the heavi ly debated question of
real income growth and gas prices and what's that doing to consumer balance sheets. And so we're watching that, especially in the kind of
LMI segment of our customer base, but right now we're not actually seeing anything that gives us reason to worry.",2022,1
12,5,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,Okay. Thank you for all  that.,2022,1
13,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Glenn.",2022,1
0,6,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Thank you. Good morning, Jeremy .",2022,1
1,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hey, Gerard.",2022,1
2,6,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Can we follow up on your comments about building up the reserves? I think you said it was $902 million that you guys built up , and it was due
to high inflation and the war in the Ukraine. How much was it due to inflation? And when you made that comment, is  it because you're
concerned about the lower end consumer spending more money for fuel and food that may lead to greater delinquencies down the road? And
how much was it due to the Ukraine situation?",2022,1
3,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Gerard, it's really a lot more general than that. So just to repeat, 900 build, 300 named specific primarily related to  Russia -associated
individual names. The other 600 is portfolio level. And as Jamie just said, it simply reflects increasi ng the probability from a very low probability
to a slightly higher probability of a, you might call it, Volcker style Fed induced recession in response to the current infl ationary environment,
which obviously is in part driven by commodity price increases , which are in part driven by the war in Ukraine, so. But it's not a super micro
portfolio level thing except to the extent that our models handle that. It's a top down modification of the probabilistic wei ghts.",2022,1
4,6,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"One of the things I hated when CECL came out is that we'd spend a lot of time in every call yapping about CECL. I just think it's a huge
mistake for all of us to spend too much time on it.",2022,1
5,6,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Understood. And then as a follow up, Jeremy, if we look at the AOCI number that you gave us, and you were very clear about it , it's going to
accrete back into the capital as those securities mature, two things. Is there anything you can do, assuming if the long end of the curve
continues to rise and probably giving you maybe a bigger hit on AOCI as we go forward, is there anything you can do to mitiga te that, whether
to shrink that, the available -for-sale portfolio, which  looks like it was $313 billion at the end of this period? Or do you just have to grow the
revenue, as you pointed out, as another way of growing your capital?",2022,1
6,6,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, I think that obviously we always try to grow revenue sort of independently of anything else. I think the large point here is, yes,
there are some things that can be done to mitigate this, but the big picture is that the central case path is one that gets u s to whe re we want to
be when we need to be there in terms of CET1 and leverage. And if things don't play out along the lines of the central case, we have tools and
levers available to adjust across a range of dimensions, so.",2022,1
7,6,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,Okay. Thank you.,2022,1
0,7,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Hi. I have a question for both Jeremy and Jamie. Jeremy, I guess the SLR 5.2% close to the minimum, you explained that. But the since
quarter end, AOCI probably has gotten worse and I'm guessing your SLR might be very – even closer to that minimum. So I understand your
central case, it's fine. Your outlook is good . But at what point do you say – do you stop buybacks? Or do you think you'll buy back maybe half
of the $30 billion authorization or does JPMorgan even put on asset caps given just the amazing asset growth over the last th ree months? So
that's my question  for Jeremy.
The bigger picture is for you, Jamie. Your CEO letter, the takeaway was in the eyes of the beholder like, oh, Jamie is really  worried about a
recession this year. No, he's not. So the first question certainly ties into the second. So, Jeremy,  plan for buybacks, stopping at asset caps.
And then, Jamie, your view of the broader economies and that feeds into your expectations for capital growth. Thank you.",2022,1
1,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Okay. Mike, so let me take this capital one. So first of all, let's not talk about asset caps. That's just not a meaningful thing. I think that's a
distraction and the terminology is unhelpful. Then in terms of the leverage ratio, just remember that the denominator of that  numb er is so big
that it actually takes like pretty big moves to move the ratio. So 5.20% is actually still pretty far away from 5% and of cou rse there are relatively
easy to use tools to address that as well, as was alluded to earlier.
In addition, I do thin k it's worth just reminding everyone of how the ERI restrictions work now relative to how they were at the beginning of the
crisis. Just briefly, just to remember that based on the redefinition, if you drop into the regulatory buffer zone, your subj ect to 60% of restriction
which based on our recent historical net income generation still gives us like ample, ample capacity to pay the dividend and so on. So it's
obviously not part of the plan, but it's just worth remembering that the cliff effects that we ha d in there at the beginning of the pandemic are no
longer there.
And then in terms of buybacks, just a reminder that the $30 billion authorization is a non -time bounded SEC requirement. It's not the old
CCAR standard. So it's just a signal that we want to  have that capacity and that flexibility, but it doesn't really say that much about how much
we're actually planning to do in the near -term.",2022,1
2,7,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Are you allowed to say what you're planning to do in the near -term like just – like if you're kind of like half the level last year, do you think you
can keep that or does it slow down or you're not giving guidance now –",2022,1
3,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So let's talk about buybacks for a second. In the post -SCB world, we haven't been guiding a lot on the pace of buybacks, mainly
because as you know they're at the bottom of our capital stack. So we're focused on investing in the business, providing capi tal to support
growing RWA, acquisitions when they make sense, et cetera, et cetera… and buybacks are an output.
As we have discussed, in the current environment, the rate of buybacks is clearly going to be less than it was in the 2021 pe riod as a result of
the interaction of all those effects and that's a good thing. It means that we have better uses for the capital and if things evo lve one way or the
other, then the rate of buybacks will be an output but it's one of the tools in the toolkit.",2022,1
4,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chair man, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Mike, I would just say…",2022,1
5,7,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,Okay.,2022,1
6,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"...if you look at liquidity and capital, it's extraordinary. And we don't want to have buffers on top of buffers. So we're going to manage this pretty
tightly over time. And obviously, when you have AOCI and earnings and CECL, all that, but being conscious of all that. We can  manage
through that and we've done some acquisitions this year. And so plus, we are adding – we're planning to have more capital for the increase in
G-SIFI down the road which reduces stock buyback.
But the amount – I'd look at the amount of liquidity, the earnings,  the capital, all that. That's the stuff that really matters and at the end of the
day, it's driving customers. We serve customers which is why we're here. We don't serve managing SLR. That's kind of an outpu t of stuff we
do and so – and then your question  about – I think it was about recession basically. Yeah...",2022,1
7,7,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,Yes.,2022,1
8,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"...do you want to read the question, Mike.",2022,1
9,7,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Yeah, no, I mean, if you read your CEO letter, that's great. You're the Chief Worry Officer. You're the Chief Risk Manager. Y ou're bringing up
all the things that keep you up at night which is great. But you can read it one way and say, hey, Jamie and JPMorgan thinks there's going to
be a recession this year. And you can read it another way saying, hey, things are fine but these are some tail risks. So, do you think – and I'll
repeat what Glenn said. Your view's better than mine, and  I'm not going to accept anything else. You have a lot people, a lot of resources. Do
you think the US is going to have a recession this year based on everything you know?",2022,1
10,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I don't. But I just want to caution this. First of all, I can't forecast the future any more than anyone else. And the Fed fore casts it, and
everyone forecasts it, and everyone's wrong all the time. And I think it's a mistake. We run the company to serve cli ents through thick or thin.
That's what we do. We know there are going to be ups, we know there are going to be downs. We know the weather's going to cha nge and a
lot of stuff like that.
But I have pointed out in my letter is very strong underlying growth  right now which will go on. It's not stoppable. The consumer has money.
They pay down credit card debt. Confidence isn't high, but the fact that they have money, they're spending their money, they have $2 trillion
still in the savings and checking account s. Businesses are in good shape. Home prices are up. Credit is extraordinarily good. So you have
this, that's one factor. That's going to continue in the second quarter, third quarter. And after that, it's hard to predict.
You've got two other very large countervailing factors which you guys are all completely aware of. One is inflation/QT. You've never seen that
before. I'm simply pointing out that those are storm clouds on the horizon that may disappear, they may not. That's a fact. A nd I'm quite
conscio us of that fact. And I do expect that alone will create volatility and concerns and endless printing and endless headlines an d stuff like
that.
And the second is war in Ukraine. I pointed out in my letter that war in Ukraine, usually wars don't necessaril y affect the global economy in the
short run. But there are exceptions to that. This may very well be one of them. I'm not looking at this on a static basis, ok ay? So you're looking
at this war in Ukraine, and we have sanctions. Things are unpredictable. W ars are unpredictable. Wars have unpredictable outcomes. You've
already seen in oil markets, the oil markets are precarious. Okay? So I pointed that out over and over that if people don't u nderstand that
those things can change dramatically for either phys ical reasons, cyber reasons, or just supply/demand.
And so that's another huge cloud on the horizon. And we're prepared for it. We understand it, we're just, I can't tell you th e outcome of it. I
hope those things all disappear and go away, we have a soft  landing and the war is resolved, okay. I just wouldn't bet on all of that. And of
course, being a risk manager, we're going to get through all of that. We're going to serve our clients, and we're going to ga in share. We're
going to come out of that earnin g tremendous returns on capital like we have in the past.",2022,1

kind of looking at that business and reevaluating just how you think about some of the outsize risks, and maybe you could upd ate us on that

6,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And I would take it one step further. I think the whole paradigm of saying it's a ten standard deviation event is naïve, right? We know
that returns are not normally distributed. We know that. Regulators know that. The capital framework recognizes that in a bro ad variety of
ways including things like stress VaR . So I don't think – of course  you can't predict where and in which asset class and in which particular
moment you're going to see these types of fat -tail events, but the framework recognizes in a range of ways that that's the case, and that's how
we manage risk, and that's how we're c apitalized.",2022,1
7,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So we do CCAR once a year, as you guys see. But no, we actually run 100 different various stress tests every week with extrem e movements

events like this, we always look at, but it doesn't happen to us. It can happen to someone else. We still analyze everything that maybe we

9,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Guys, we're just talking about interest rates going up maybe more than 3%, convexity is going up, AOCI is going up. There are all these
various reasons not to do that. We're not going to do it just to give you a little bit more NII next quarter.",2022,1
10,8,Matt O’Connor,Analyst,Inc.,Okay. Thank you.,2022,1
0,9,James Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe you could just talk about how you're thinking about the trajectory of loan growth from here, where you're seeing
the biggest pockets of strength. And specifically to cards, is this significant year -over-year growth driven more by slowing pay downs? Or is
that increasing demand, or a combination of both? Thanks.",2022,1
1,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Sure. So you'll remember in the fourth quarter that we talked about the outlook based on sort of high -single -digit loan growth for the
year. And this quarter, we've roughly seen that. Interestingly, it's a little bit more driven by wholesale this quarter, which sort of brings us to
your question of Card. So overall, Card loan growth is reasonably robust when you adjust for seasonality and so on. And that' s really primarily
driven by spe nd which, as you know, is very robust.
The question inside of that is then what's going on with revolve. And I think our core revolve thesis of getting back to the pre-pandemic levels
of revolving balances by the end of the year is still in place to a goo d approximation. At the margin, we probably saw the take -off moment
delayed by six weeks or so because of Omicron. But some of that's reaccelerating now. We see that in some of the March number s. So we'll
see how it goes.
But also just a reminder that the re's a very, very close linkage between what we see in revolve and what we see in charge -offs. And so in the
moment where revolve is lagging potentially, certainly that was true throughout the pandemic period relative to what we had t hought, we also
saw ex ceptionally lower charge -offs. So on a bottom -line basis, the run rate performance, there's significant offset there.
But the core thesis is still there. Spend is robust. We are seeing spend down in some of the cash buffers in the customer seg ment that te nds
to revolve, so more or less as anticipated, I would say.",2022,1
2,9,James Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities,"Okay. And then maybe just skipping over to trading, clearly a stronger quarter, must have finished off strongly in March. So any confirmation of
that? And how do we – if you're expecting more volatility around Fed and QT, should we be thinking that this could be a better than
normalization year? How are you thinking about trading, I guess, going forward?",2022,1

4,9,James Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities,Yeah. I could try.,2022,1
5,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I'll just add to that. I cannot foresee any scenario at all where you're not going to have a lot of volatility in markets goi ng forward. We've already
spoken about the enormous strength of the economy, QT, i nflation, war, commodity prices. There's almost no chance you won't have volatile
markets. That could be good or of bad for trading, but there's almost no chance it won't happen and I think people should be prepared for that.",2022,1
6,9,James Mitchell,Analyst,Seap ort Global Securities,All right. Appreciate the color.,2022,1
0,10,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Inc.,"Good morning. I guess just one more question on the macro outlook. I guess we can debate whether or not we get into a recession over the
next year. But, Jamie, would love to hear your thoughts around as we think about just the medium term, do you see a better Ca pEx cycle for
the US econ omy? We've heard a lot about reshoring, labor productivity, how companies are dealing with it. Just given the lens you have i n
terms of large corporates, middle market customers, do you see some pent -up demand for CapEx spending that's going to be a big dr iver of
growth, maybe not for the next six months but as we think about the medium term next few years?",2022,1
1,10,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yes, in general, because as people are spending money and you need to produce more goods and all that, yes, we generally see CapEx
going up and I've forgot the exact number. You're better off looking with our great economists forecast for that than asking me. And we see it
in the borrowing a little bit.",2022,1
2,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief  Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Now, we do see pretty nice loan growth in the Commercial Bank. I mean, there's a bunch of different factors there. It could b e some inventory

0,1,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Hey. Good morning,  Jeremy. Hey, good morning, Jamie. Wanted to start off with a question on capital targets. I don't believe you provided an
update on your firm wide CET1 target of 12.5% to 13% . And given the new higher SCB, future increases in your GSIB surcharge to 4.5% , your
regulatory minimum is slated to increase beyond 13% by 2024, which is also beyond the horizon reflected on slide 3. And just given that high
regulatory minimum, elevated SCB volatility in recent years, what do you believe is an appropriate capital tar get for you to manage to from
here over the long term?",2022,2
1,1,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Steve, good question. So, obviously, you're right in the sense that we didn't talk about 2024 on the slide. And as you note, we have two
GSIB bucket increases coming: one in the first quarter of 2023 and the other one in the first quarter of 2024. So we had work ed all that out at
Investor Day and talked about 12.5% to 13% target, which implies sort of  a modest buffer to be used flexibly based on what we expected
would be some increase in SCB. Obviously, the increase came in a bit higher than expected, so for now, we're really focused on 1Q 2023. Of
course all else equal, you would assume that that 12.5 % to 13% for 2024 would be a little bit higher, but there is another round of SCB and
that's a long way away. And as you know and as you can see, there's a lot of organic capital generation. So we'll  kind of cross that bridge
when we come to it.",2022,2
2,1,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,We intend to drive that  SCB down by reducing the things that created it.,2022,2
3,1,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Fair enough. And just for my follow up on the loan growth outlook, loan growth continues to surprise positively. Certainly, the tone, Jeremy,
that you conveyed was quite constructive despite the challenging macro backdrop. But with companie s citing higher inventory level s, declining
personal savings rates, growing inflationary  pressures, whole list of potential headwinds that could negatively impact loan growth from here,  I
was hoping you could just speak to the outlook for loan growth across some of the different busines ses. And what do you see as a sustainable
run rate of loan growth over the medium term?",2022,2
4,1,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, so we've talked as you know, Steve, about sort of a mid- to-high- single -digits loan growth expectation for this year, and that outlook is
more or less still in place. Obviously, we only have half the year left. We continue to see quite robust C&I growth, both higher revolver utilization and new account origination.  We're al so seeing good growth in CRE. And, of course, we continue to see very robust C ard loan
growth, which is nice to see. Outlook beyond this year, I'm not going to give now. And obviously, as you note, it's going to be pretty much a
function of the ec onomic environment, so.",2022,2
5,1,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, the only thing I would like to add is that certain loan growth is discretionary and portfolio- based. Think of mortgages, and there's a good
chance we're going to drive it down substantially.",2022,2
6,1,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,Thanks so much for taking my questions.,2022,2
7,1,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Steve.",2022,2
0,2,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Hi. Thanks very much. I wonder if you could just talk to how you balance it all, meaning JPMorgan is always growth- minded. You underwrite
for returns ov er the cycle. I get that. But given some of the potential bad stuff going on in the world that you've noted in some of the ar ticles
you've been in and at the conference, is there any point where that rougher outlook has you tightening the underwriting box to build capital
and liquidity faster? Or do you think you can get there just through what you've laid out today on the buyback pause?",2022,2
1,2,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, no, so, I mean, look,  I think all of these things are true at the same time, right? So first of all, as you can see on page 3, the organic
capital generation enables us to build very quickly to get to where we need to be with a nice appropriate buffer on time if not early. At the same
time, as Jamie has noted, obviously, in this moment, we're going to scrutinize even more aggressively than we always do, elem ents of our
lending which are either low returning or have a low client nexus  or both. We do that all the time anyway, but  of course in this moment we're
going to turn up the heat on that a little bit.
In terms of underwriting, as you say, we do underwrite through the cycle. I think we feel comfortable with our risk appetite and our credit box,
and I don't think we expect an y particular change there.",2022,2
2,2,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, I mean the only thing I would add is that certain, obviously, risks that we take kind of price themselves. So if you look at our bridge book,
it's sm aller than it was because we priced ourself out of the market, and that was a good thing because a lot of people will lose a lot of money
there, and we lost a little. So we are very conscious of that kind of thing all the time.",2022,2
3,2,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Ever core ISI,"Well, I appreciate that. And did you all consider a CECL reserve and increasing the probability to the core scenario in this quarter? And just
curious on how you thought about that. Thanks.",2022,2
4,2,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMo rgan Chase & Co.,"Yes, but we didn't do it. And obviously, what we do in the future quarters will remain to be seen.",2022,2
5,2,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And, Glenn, just remember that we did do that last quarter, right? So we already introduced a sort of skew to the outlook beyond what's
implied by the market to reflect our own slightly more negative view. And in a sense, arguably we were sort of early on that, so it really wasn't
necessary t his quarter.",2022,2
6,2,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,All right. Thank you both.,2022,2
0,3,John E. McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Hi. Good morning. Jerem y, just wondering if you could talk about the deposit trends you're seeing, the differences between commercial
deposits, wealth management and retail in terms of flows and repricing pressures.",2022,2
1,3,Jeremy  Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Comm ittee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Great question, John. And I think you're right to break it down by the different segments because we are seeing different dynamics
there. So on the wholesale side, you do see some lower deposits, some deposit attrition,  and that is entirely expected and part of the plan in
the sense that, for client reasons, we had slightly higher appetite, especially in parts of the C ommercial Bank, for non- operating deposits,
knowi ng fully that our pricing strategy as rates went up was  going to be not pay off. And therefore, we expected the attrition from that client
base. And so we're seeing that, and that's actually something that we want, all else equal, and is playing out in line with expectations.
You do see a little bit of a decl ine or a little bit of a headwind in Wealth Management. I think that's just seasonal tax payments being a little bit
higher than usual. And then on the consumer side, we're really not seeing much at all. So that remains strong. We're not seeing any attriti on
there. And it's early in the cycle to really be observing much one way or the other from a pricing perspective.",2022,2
2,3,John E. McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Okay. And then as a follow up, in  terms of the updated NII outlook, you had talked about an exit rate in the fourth quarter of about $66 billion at
Investor Day. Just kind of wondering what that looks like and what kind of fading benefit from rate hikes you have assumed in your outlook.",2022,2
3,3,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating  Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, so the $66 billion number, if you want kind of to put a number in, you can use something like $68 billion, $68 billion plus, something like that. Obviously, we're annualizing one quarter, so there can always be noi se in there, but that seems like a good number to us, that's
consistent with the increase for the full year. And sorry, John, can you repeat your other question?",2022,2
4,3,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Execut ive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,2023.,2022,2
5,3,John E. McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,Just deposit betas Yeah.,2022,2
6,3,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in terms of 2023, we had talked at Investor Day about how we saw upside into 2023 from that fourth quarter run rate.
And that more or less remains true. There is some upside. Obviously, we're starting from a higher launch point, higher  rates, and less so after
the CPI trend, but there have been moments where there were cuts in the 2023 Fed expectations. So that could have some impact on the
dynamic. Obviously, this is all in an environment of very volatile implieds, but the core view of  some upside from that fourth quarter run rate
into 2023 is still in place.",2022,2
7,3,John E. McDonald,Analy st,Autonomous Research,Got it. Thank you.,2022,2
0,4,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,Hi. Good morning.,2022,2

2,4,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hey, Betsy.",2022,2
3,4,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Jamie, you mentioned just on the SCB earlier that you intended to reduce it by reducing the things that caused it to rise. Could you give us a
sense as to what you saw in the results that you got that drove that SCB up? Because I talk to folks that say it's a black box, so it would be
helpful to understand what you se e as what the drivers were to that SCB increase.",2022,2
4,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, first of all, it's public, so you can actually go see what drives it, the global market shock and credit losses, stuff like that. And we don't
agree with the stress test. It's inconsistent. It's not transparent. It's too volatile. It's basically capricious , arbitra ry... We do 100 a week, this is
one. And I think  to drive capital up and down by 80 basis points ... So we'll work on i t. We haven't made definitive decisions, but I've already
mentioned about, we dramatically reduced RWA this quarter. We may do that again next quarter. We're probably going to drive down mortgages, and we'll probably drive down other credit too that create s SCB.
So we're not going to go into specifics on that. It's easy for us to do. You've seen us do it before. We're going to drive down non -operating
deposits. It creates no risk to us, but as the GSIB, and various  things. And so we're going to manage the balance sheet, get good returns,
have great clients. And I'm not worried about it. We just want to get there right away. I don't want to s it there and dawdle,  that's  the rule, they
gave it to us, we're going.",2022,2
5,4,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,Got it. And then...,2022,2
6,4,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Betsy, maybe I' ll just jump in –  hey, Betsy. Maybe I'll just jump in a little bit on the black box...",2022,2
7,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"But another very important point for shareholders, that number, when they –  that doesn't even remotely – the stress loss doesn't even
remotely represent what would happen under that kind of scenario. And I'm not s aying the Fed says it should or shouldn't, but I would tell you
we'd make money under that scenario. We wouldn't lose, I think they had us losing $44 billion. There's almost no chance that that would be
true.
And I just –  so I –  and I feel bad for the shareholders because people look at that and s ay, well, what's going to happen? I mean but  there's
good evidence, we didn't lose money after Lehman, we didn't lose money in the great – what just happened. We didn't lose money in great
financial recession.
The company's got huge underlying earnings power and consistent revenues in CCB, Asset Management custody, payment services. And
then we have some kind of fairly volatile streams. And now we've got the CECL, which obviously can go up or down quite a bit.  But again,
that's an accounting entry. And so we feel we're in very good shape. We just have to hold a higher number now and we're going to go there.",2022,2
8,4,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And, Betsy, ma ybe I'll just comment briefly on the black box point. Because as Jamie noted, the SCB is quite volatile, and I think you see that
across the industry. And we feel very good about building quickly enough to meet the higher requirements. But they’re pretty big changes that
come into effect fairly qui ckly for banks, and I think that's probably not healthy.
And the amount of transparency, there is a lot of information released, as Jamie says. But since the SCB is really a quantity  that gets
measured to the peak draw -down period, and that information does not get released, it winds up being really very hard at any given moment to
understand what's actually driving it.
And that combination of suboptimal transparency and high volatility is really our central crit icism, I guess I would say. B ut nonetheless, the
organic capital generation...",2022,2
9,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"The other thing is, it's got bad effects for the economy because we're –  I just said, we're going to dr ive down this and drive down this, it's not
good for the United States economy. And the mortgage business, in particular, is bad for lower income mortgages, which hurts lower income,
minorities and stuff like that because we haven't fixed the mortgage busi ness, and now we're maki ng it worse. There's no real risk in it. It's not
a benefit to JPMorgan, but it hurts this country. And it's very unfortunate.",2022,2
10,4,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"No. I hear you on all that. And the mortgage comm ent you made earlier was  about shrinking mortgage growth rates or shrinking the balances
of mortgages that you have on the  book ...",2022,2
11,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"The balance...  ...well, no, we'll originate, but the balances in the books will probably come down. And look, we reserve the right to change that,
but that's a portfolio decision. And if it doesn't make sense to own mortgages, we're not going to own them.",2022,2
12,4,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LL C,"Yeah. And w ould you reduce the buffer? I mean in the past, Jamie, you've talked about, hey, as these required capital ratios increase relative
to the risk in your business staying more consistent, then you've said before that you may operate with less  of a buffer. Could you unpack that
a little bit?",2022,2
13,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"We're going to keep a buffer –  I'm not even sure what the SCB means at this point. We're not going to go below any regulatory minimum. And
if we have to, we'll just drive down credit more to create what we've got to create. It's a terrible way to run a financial system,  and we owe you
more on what we think that buffer should be because we have so much – what I think is so much excess c apital. It ju st causes huge confusion
about what you should be doing with your capital.
But just keep in mind one thing, we're earning 17% of tangible equity, we can continue doing that. The company is in great shape. We're going to serve our clients and manage the hell out the rest of this stuff. We still think we have great businesses and stuff like that. And that's what
we're going to do. Most of this stuff doesn't create any additional risk at all, it just creates capital.",2022,2
14,4,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,M organ Stanley  & Co. LLC,Thank you.,2022,2
0,5,James Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just on expenses, if I kind of look at the first half with this slowdown in investment banking, I think your annualized
is less than $76 billion, but you're still targeting $77 billion. Is that implication of just higher investment spend in the second half? Or just
uncertainty around ge tting th e pipeline completed or not and just assuming it might get done until we know better?",2022,2
1,5,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Jim. Good question. We've looked at that too. It's definitely more the former than the latter. In other words, $77 billion is the number that
we see right now and the number that we believe. And we can see in our outlook a bunch of factors driving up second half expense including
deal M&A closing and adding to the run -rate as well as continued execution of our investment plans resulting in increased head count
probably at a faster pace as we kind of have ramped up our hiring capacity and so on. So I wouldn't draw any conclusions about lower than
$77 billion based on t he first  half numbers.",2022,2
2,5,James Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities,"Okay. Great. And then just maybe on credit. It continues to look, I guess, very good, whether it's on the consumer side or co mmercial side. We
don't really see it. But are you st arting t o see any initial cracks in credit or strains in the system?",2022,2
3,5,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Look, I think the short answer to that question is no. Certainly not in any of our reported a ctual results for this quarter. The place that
everyone...",2022,2
4,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,It’s excellent.,2022,2
5,5,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"...right. Exa ctly. Obviously still running well below normal levels from the pre- pandemic period. But if you really want to kind of turn up the
magnification on the microscope and look really, really, really closely, if you look at cash buffers in the lower income segm ents and early
delinquency roll -rates in those segments, you can maybe see a little bit of an early warning signal to the effect that the burn- down of excess
cash is a little bit faster there, b uffers are still above what they were pre- pandemi c but coming down,  and that absolute numbers for the typical
customer are not that high.
And you do see those early delinquency buckets still below pre- pandemic levels but getting closer in the lower income segment. So if you
wanted to try to look for ear ly warning si gnals, that's where you would see it. But I think there's really still a big question about whether that's
simply normalization or whether it's actually an early warning sign of deterioration. And for us, as you know, our portfolio is really n ot very
expos ed to that segment of the market, so not really very significant for us.",2022,2
6,5,James Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities,Right. So prime is still holding up quite well. Thanks.,2022,2
7,5,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yes.,2022,2
8,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Looking better.,2022,2
0,6,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies & Company,"Yeah, hey, guys. Good morning. Just a follow up on the points about managing the balance sheet and capital and RWAs. How do you think
about your ability to manage that RWA output and dimensionalizing how, if at all, it might  impact either the net income outcome or the ROTCE
outcome as you look forward?",2022,2
1,6,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Just very roughly, we have a tremendous ability to manage it. And I can think we do it without affecting our ROTCE targets and stuff like that.
Obviously, it'll affect NII a little bit and capital generation a little bit and stuff like that. But all told, we're going t o manage the hell  out of it, and
we'll be fine.",2022,2
2,6,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies & C ompany,"Got it. Okay. That's a fair point. A nd then just second one on cards. Card revenue rate continues to slip even with the NII benefit. Obviously,
you've got the denominator increase in there too and spend versus lend. Can you just help us understand the dynamics underneath Card
revenue rate and where you expect it to go from here? Thanks.",2022,2
3,6,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So on Card revenue rate, we'd said that we thought 10% wa s a reasonable number for the full year. And i t's running a little bit
lower right now, and I think the current level –  look, what is it  Mikael , 9.6% or something, is probably the right number for the full year at this
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer & Member -Operating Committee, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A
point. And really the difference is d riven by a couple factors. The main one is tha t while the growth and revolve is basically still in place, our
view that we would see normalization revolve balances happening towards early –  beginning of next year, that – starting point of that did get
slightly delayed by Omicron, by about six weeks. A nd so that, all else equal, is a little bit of a NII headwind relative to what we'd expected but
still obviously very robust.",2022,2
4,6,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Can I just add a little bit on because I know I'm harping on mortgage a little bit here but I just want to explain it. Because if you go to Europe,
okay, the capital held against mortgages is like a fifth of what we have to hold here. And we can obviously manage  that, and standardized risk
weighted assets do not represent returns or risk. So there are a lot of ways to manage it, and there's no securitization market today. So our
view would change if there's a securitization market. We might do something different . But by not owning it, buying it, selling it, hedging it,
swapping it, there are a million ways to manage it without really affecting a lot of your risk and returns. And so it's unfor tunate, because I think
this is all kind of a waste of time in terms of serving our client.
Our job is to serve clients t hrough thick or thin, good or bad, with what they need and how they need it, and now we spend all our time talking
about these ridiculous regulatory requirements.",2022,2
5,6,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, M ember -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. So yeah and just to finish on Card, so slightly lower NII just from the Omicron delay and that slightly better -than- expected new client
acquisition is a driver there. And then there are some subtle kind of funding effects from the higher rate envir onment contributing to it as well.",2022,2
6,6,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies & Company,Okay. Thanks a lot.,2022,2
0,7,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,Hi. G ood morning.,2022,2
1,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hey, Mike.",2022,2
2,7,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Could you help me reconcile your words with your actions? After Investor Day, Jamie, you said a hurricane i s on the horizon. But today, you're
holding firm with your $77 billion expense guidance for 2022. I mean, it's like you're acting like there's sunny skies ahead,  you're out buying
kayaks, surfboards, wave runners just before the storm. So is it tough times  or not?",2022,2
3,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"No, let me –  first of all, we run the company –  we've always run the company consistently, investing, doing stuff through storms. We don't like
pull in and pull out and go up and go down and go into markets and out of markets through storms. We manage the company, and you've
seen us do this consistently, since I've been at Bank One. We invest, we grow, we expand, we manage through the storm and stuff like that.
Jamie Dimon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A
And so I  had mentioned, I don't know if you were on the media call, but there are very good current numbers taking place. Consumers are in
good shape. They're spending money, they have more incom e, jobs are plentiful, they're spending 10% more than last year, almost 30% plus
more than pre- COVID. Businesses, you talk to them, they're in good shape, they are doing fine. We've never seen business credit be better
ever, like in our lifetimes, and that 's the current environment.
The future environment, which is not that far  off, involves rates going up maybe more than people think, because of inflation, maybe
stagflation, maybe a soft –  there might be a soft landing. I'm simply saying there's a range of potential outcomes from a soft landing to a hard
landing,  driven by how much rates go up, the effect of quantitative tightening, the effect of volatile markets and obviously this terrible
humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and the war and then the eff ect of that on food and oil and gas. And we're simply pointing out –  those things
make the probabilities and possibilities of these events different.
It's not going to change how we run the company. The economy will be bigger in 10 years. We're going to run the company. We're going to
serve more clients. We're going to open our branches. We're going to invest in the things, and we'll manage through that. If you look at what
we do, our bridge book is way down. That was managing certain exposures. We're not  in subprime fundamentally. That's managing your
exposures. We're quite careful ab out how we run the risk of the company, and if there was a reason to cut back on something, we would. But
not only  do we think it's a great business that's got great growth prospects, it's just going to go through a storm.
And in fact, going through a storm, we will – that gives us opportunities too. I always remind myself the economy will be a lot bigger in 10
years, we're here to serve clients through thick or thin, and we will do that.",2022,2
4,7,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"So clearly, runni ng the company for next 5 to 10 years, if we have a recession in the next 5 to 10 months, how does technology help you
manage through that better, whether it's credit losses,  managing for less credit losses, expenses, more flexibility, or revenues maybe gaining
market share? What's the benefit of all these technology investments if we have a recession over the next...",2022,2
5,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I think we gave you some examples at Investor Day. For example, AI,  which we spend a lot of money on, we gave you a couple examples. But
one of them is we spent $100 million building certain risk and fraud systems so that when we process pay ments on the consumer side, losses
are down $100 million or $200 million with volu mes way up. That's a huge benefit. I don't think you'd want us to stop doing that because
there's a recession. And so plus, in a recession, certain things get cheaper. Branches are enormously profitable. Banks are enormously
profitable. And we're going to keep on doing those things, and we've managed through recessions before. We'll manage it again. And I'm quite
comfortable we'll do it quite well.",2022,2
6,7,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,All right. Thank you.,2022,2
7,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Execut ive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"But stop- starting on recruiting or training or technology or branch, right -  that's crazy . We don't do that, and we've never done that. We didn't
do it in 2008 and 2009. And put us in quite good stead in terms –  yeah.",2022,2
8,7,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Yeah. I think the only other thing is just Market revenues are a lot weaker, right? I mean the Market outlook is wors e, and so we know you had
structural spending. So when all else equal that'd be a little bit less then.",2022,2
9,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yes. That's very performance- based too. And again, Mike, the way I look at it a little bit, in 15 years the global GDP or 20 years the global
GDP, global financial ass ets, global companies , companies  over $1 billion, will all double. That's what we're building for. We're not building for
like 18 months.",2022,2
10,7,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells  Fargo Securities LLC,Okay. Thank you.,2022,2
0,8,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Thank you. Good morning, guys. Jeremy, you touched on the deposit commentary a short while ago. Can you elaborate on QT and t he impact
that you've seen? Now, granted, I know June was not full QT of $95 billion a month, but can you guys give us a flavor? And I think, Jamie, you
mentioned that if I heard it correctly, that maybe $300 billion to $400 billion of deposits could outflow over time, I'm assu ming due to QT. But
can you guys elaborate what you saw in June? Is it  tracking the way you think it's going to be? And any further outlook for what the deposits
could be over the next 12 months due to QT?",2022,2
1,8,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Oper ating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Hey, Gerard. So, as you know, QT just started so I think it 's not the sort of thing where you can say I expect this exact outcome and
then sort of track it sector -by-sector because you can see the clear impact  on system -wide deposits but that also interacts with RRP and TGA
and stuff  like that and so how that flow s into the banking system and then into any individual bank across the wholesale and consumer
segments is kind of a tricky thing. So it's early on that. But at a high level and your comments about what Jamie said before are right.
The story remains true, which is that depending on how QT interacts with RRP and loan growth, in particular, you could see some decline in
deposits in the banking system and we would see our share of that but we would expect that to primarily come out of wholesale and primarily
come out of the non- operating and sort of less valuable portions of our deposit base. While in consumer, while you could in theory have a little
bit of  a headwind there, we feel pretty good about our ability to keep those levels pretty steady based on the s trength of the franchise and the
ability to take share.",2022,2
2,8,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Very good. And then as a follow up, I don't believe you guys disclosed the outstandings in the bridge book, but two questions. And, Jamie,
you've been very clear about this in the last 10 years, how you've de -risked that balance sheet and you mentioned that already today. Can you
just give us som e color on how different it is today from 2008- 2009 just so investors know that it is meaningfully different? And second, what
caused the write- down in the bridge book this quarter?",2022,2
3,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So if you go back to 2007 I think, the whole street bridge book was $480 billion. I think the whole street bridge book today is $100 billion or
under $100 billion.",2022,2
4,8,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah. It's like 20%.,2022,2
5,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Our percent of that bridge brook has come down substantially just in the last 12 months and that's really just underwriting l oan by loan by loan,
and you win s ome and you lose some. And if you guys look at high yield spreads and stuff like that, bonds were down 6%, that's what you
see. So you have some flex and we're big boys, we know that, and there is write- downs of a couple of bridge loans. They're not huge. I think
they were in the I nvestment Banking line.",2022,2
6,8,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Membe r-Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, it's in the IB revenue line and there's a small amount in the C ommercial Bank as well. But as you said, Jamie, and as Daniel also
mentioned at Investor Day, I think we made conscious choices here to dial  back our risk appetite here and accepted some share losses in
leverage finance. So we feel good about where we are. We're still open for business for the right deals at the right risk appetite on the right
term, absolutely, but we've been careful.",2022,2
7,8,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,Very good. Thank you.,2022,2
0,9,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Hi. Just had a few follow -up questions. The first is on balance sheet management  .Jeremy, the illustrative path that you set forth on slide 3,
does that include RWA mitigation? And as we think about the $58 billi on-plus in updated NII guide, what kind of deposit growth does that
assume? You noted that part of the SCB mitigation is to drive out non- operating deposits. Just wanted to understand what the assumption was
there as well, please.",2022,2
1,9,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Fin ancial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Hey, Erika. S ure. So first point, you have to turn on  your magnifying glass, but if you look at footnote 5 on page 3, you can see that right
at the end of there, it says assumes flat RWA in the projection. And I think within that, who knows what the exact mix will be and you've heard
Jamie's comments on that, but if you look at the table above, you see that you've got the usual moving parts. We've got organic loan growth
that we want  that's profitable on its own, or in part of important relationships that we'd like to s ee continue to happen.
Some of it is a little bit passive. We can't really control it. It moves up and down as a function of factors like VaR. And t hen there's the
mitigation piece of it, which we're going to turn up the scrutiny quite intensely, as I sai d before, on lower returning, lower client  nexus , or both.
So across those three bits, we'll see how it goes. But as Jamie said, we feel pretty confident here.
In term s of deposits, at this point, deposit growth is probably less of a driver overall, looking forward of the NII outlook. Our deposit outloo k
remains more or less the same that I said before and that we've talked about at Investor Day, which is we do expect t o see some attrition in
wholesale. We expect consumer to be relatively stable, and we'll see how it goes.",2022,2
2,9,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Got it. And my follow up question is for Jamie. Jamie, we've heard your caution about the economy, and I think there's a bigger debate on how
the US consumer is going to be impacted in light or in contact with the downturn. T he statistics that Jeremy laid out imply a pretty healthy
starting point for the consumer that you bank, and the reserve build for loan growth in Card and the less than 2% loss rate in C ard lead us to
believe that your consumer is still okay. As you think about the various scenarios and you think about the realistic range of outcomes, how
does the US consumer perform, because it feels l ike that's the big wild card. And we've seen the journal term, a job flow or recession. I just
wanted to get your thoughts there.",2022,2
3,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, so first I just want to point out that, on tha t chart, that's not a forecast what it's going to be at the end of the quarter. So we're going to –
if you're going to penc il in some of your models, it's 12.5% on December 31 and it will probably be 13% at the end of the first quarter. And
because obvious ly we use capital for a whole bunch of different reasons. And the consumer – I feel like a broken record. The consumer right
now is in great shape. So even if we go into a recession, they're entering that recession with less leverage in far better shape than they did in
2008 and 2009 and far better shape than they did even in 2020. And jobs are plentiful.
Now, of course, jobs  may disappear. Things happen, so, but they're in very good shape. And obviously, when you have recessions, it affects
consumer incom e and consumer credit. Our credit card portfolio is prime. I mean, it's exceptional. But again, we're adults in that. We know that
if you have a recession loss, it will go up. We prepare for all that, and we're prepared to take it because we grow the business over time. We're not going to just immediately run out of it, and so I think it's great that the consumer's in good shape and it's excellent that –  I like the fact that
wages are going up for people on the low end. I like the fact that jobs are plentif ul. I think that's good for the average American, and we should
applaud that. And so they're in good shape right now.",2022,2
4,9,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,Thanks for that.,2022,2

0,12,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Good morning. I guess just a coupl e of follow -ups, Jeremy. In terms of the markets  have gone very quickly from pricing in a ton of rate hikes to
potentially pricing in rate cuts next year. Just talk to us, like how that's informing your ALCO balance sheet management as you think about
hedging, downside risk from lower rates start 12 to 18 months out. Like should we expect you to add duration or do anything synthetic to
protect against lower rates?",2022,2
1,12,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,We're going to keep that to ourselves.,2022,2
2,12,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, yeah. But I don't know, maybe if you want a little bit of a general color about how we're thinking about the portfolio.  I do think...",2022,2
3,12,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Off icer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Go ahead.,2022,2
4,12,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, okay, I'll keep it brief. On duration, I think at this level of rates, also with very quickly cash yields being roughly not that different from 10-
year yields, the question of duration adding or not is just generally less important for us. Then the other piece of it is whether there's the
opportunity to deploy cash into non- HQLA securities broadly into spread produc t, and obviously spread product is more attractive right now.
But as we've been talking about a lot on this call, the priority right now is to build capital. So that'll be something for l ater, I would say.",2022,2
5,12,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And I should... just point out the forward curve has been consistently wrong in my whole lifetime, so we don't necessarily make investments
based on the forward curve. And second, we've always told you that we use the portfolio and other things to manage the broad range of
outcomes, not just to try to add NII. So if you said add NII next quarter, yeah, we could do that, but that wouldn't be managing the broad outcome of potential outcomes her e which is to protect the company thr ough all possible outcomes.",2022,2
6,12,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"That's helpful. And just one follow up on credit. I heard your comments on the consumer. If we enter some version of a mild r ecession, like if
you had to pick one or two areas, where do you think losses would be driven by? Is it on the commercial side? Is it CRE? How do you expect
that downturn to kind of play out?",2022,2
7,12,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I think at Investor Day, you had a chart that showed through the cycle losses?",2022,2
8,12,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah.,2022,2
9,12,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So I mean I would just  go back to that, and we showed what we think through- the-cycle losses would be for credit cards, C&I and a
bunch of other things. And obviously, through- the-cycle is an average, and you could kind of double that. Okay.",2022,2
10,12,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And that showed exceptionally low losses in wholesale, so I'm not sure whether or not that's a prediction of the future or not, but yeah.",2022,2
11,12,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,Got it. Thank you.,2022,2
0,13,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Hi. Sorry about that. I somehow g ot disconnected. Sorry if I missed this, but if we think about provisioning or reserving for a moderate
recession, what's the best guess on how much that might be? I think for COVID it was around $14 billion ex CECL, but ob viously you alluded
to the consum er being better, and the loan mix has changed. There's lots of puts and takes, but how would you frame kind of total reserve
builds ...",2022,2
1,13,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Let me say it very simply for you. In COVID, we got to 15% unemployment within three months. And in two quarters, we added $15 billion ,
which we can easily handle. That is clearly –  I always put that almost out as the  worst case. It'll clearly be a lot less than that, and you guys
could look at the thi ngs yourselves . Every 5% is another $500 million or something like that, if you change odds and so on...",2022,2
2,13,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, we think the current reserve, the current allowance we think is conservatively appropriate for a range of scenarios. And as you
know, it's already kind of skewed to the downside, and there are probably some other elements of slight conservatism in there. So we'll see
how it goes, but we feel that i t's appropriate and conservative at this point.",2022,2
3,13,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Okay. And then separately, you've got about $14 billion of losses in OCI. Obviously, most of that flows back to capital as the bonds mature. What's k ind of some good rule of thumb in terms of how quickly that comes back if rates stabilize here?",2022,2
4,13,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,10 basis points a year of CET 1. Yeah.,2022,2
5,13,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,All right. 10 basis points you said?,2022,2

10,13,Jeremy Barnum,"Chief Financial Officer, Member -Operating Committee",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I mean, assume it's weighted average life of four or five years. Yeah, so the good rule of thumb  on constant rates is about 10 basis points of
CET1 acc retion a year.",2022,2

1,14,Operator,: Thank you. Everyone,and enjoy,the rest of your day.,2022,2
0,1,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Hi. Thanks a lot. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the NII and the deposit side to Jamie's comments there. Obviously, one of the
toughest uncertainties is to understand how we think about flows and mix and beta, so just starting to see it, it looks like , in terms of deposit
costs starting to increase. So, how do you think about it now in this new environment where we might go to 4.5%, maybe higher, in terms of
how betas might act over the course of this cycle as compared to any prior cycles and previous thoughts? Thanks.",2022,3
1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Offi cer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, thanks, Ken. Good morning. Okay. So, at Investor Day, you'll recall that Je nn said that we expected betas to be low this cycle as they
were in the prior cycle, which was a low beta cycle by historical standards. And what we're now seeing as we see the rate hikes come through
and we see the deposit rate paid develop , is that we're seeing realized betas being even lower than the prior cycle just through the actuals.
And the question is why is that ? And it's, of course, we don't really know, but plausible theories include the speed of the hikes, which probably
means that some of this is lag, but also the fact that the system is better positioned from a liquidity perspective than in p rior cycles.
So, as we look forward, we know that lags are significant right now. We know that at some point th ey will start to come out, obviously in
wholesale , they come out much faster. That's probably starting to happen now. But the exact timing of how that develops i s going to be very
much a function of the competitive environment in the marketplace for deposits, and we'll see how that plays out.",2022,3
2,1,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Got it. Okay. And then just the second follow -up on Jamie's points about, like, okay, if things do look worse ahead, looking ahead you might
have to build a little bit more , understandable , over the next couple of years. Can you just help us understand just where you are in your
scenario now as scenarios build? And just today still looks great, tomorrow there's some more uncertainty. So, how do we just  get to start to
understand how quickly and how you get your handle on that magnitude of ACL delta , and how do you think about it versus either, I don't
know, pandemic peak or day one CECL? It's very hard for all of us to see this, of course.",2022,3
3,1,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPM organ Chase & Co.,"Yeah. As you know, I think CECL is an enormously bad accounting policy. Honestly, I wouldn't spend too much time on it becaus e it's not a
real number. It's a hypothetical, probability -based number . I'm trying to make it very simple for  you. So, if you look at the pandemic, we put up
$15 billion over two quarters, and then we took it down over three or four after that . And all it did was swing all these numbers , and it didn't
change that much.
Yeah, I'm trying to give you a number, but obviously this number would be plus or minus several billion. But if unemployment goes to 6% and
that becomes the central kind of case and then you have the possibility it gets better and possibility it gets worse , we would probably have to
add something like $5 billion or $6 billion. That probably would happen over two or three quarters.",2022,3
4,1,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,Yeah .,2022,3
5,1,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,I mean that's as simple as I can make it.,2022,3
6,1,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,Yeah. Okay.,2022,3
7,1,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right now , what we have – right,  we already have a percent in the adverse and severe adverse case s. If we change that next quarter, that will
be part of that $6 billion I'm talking about.",2022,3
8,1,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,Yes. Okay. Understood. Thank you.,2022,3
0,2,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Good morning. I guess just following up, Jamie, so appreciate CECL and the model -based approach. I think you were quoted in the press
talking about the potential for a recession in the next six to nine months. Would appreciate any perspective in terms of, are you beginning to
see cracks , either in commercial real estate, consumer where it feels like the economic pain from inflation, higher rates is beginning to filter
through to your clients. Would appreciate any insights there.",2022,3
1,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, I'll take that, Ebrahim. Thanks. The short answer to that question is just no. We just don't see anything that you coul d realistically
describe as a crack in our actual credit performance. I made some comments about this in the prepared rem arks on the consumer side, but
we've done some fairly detailed analysis about different cohorts and early delinquency bucket entry rates and stuff like that . And we do see, in
some cases, some tiny increases . But generally in almost all cases, we think tha t's normalization , and it's even slower than we expect.",2022,3
2,2,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I think I'd say – we're in an environment where it's kind of odd, which is very strong consumer spend. You see it in our numbers. You
see it in other people's numbers, up 10% prior to last year, up 35% to pre-COVID. Balance sheets are very good for c onsumers. Credit card
borrowing is normalizing, not getting worse. You might see – and that's really good, so you can go  into a recession, you've got a very strong
consumer.
However, it's rather predictable if you look at how they're spending and inflatio n, so inflation if it's  10% – 10% reduces that by 10%.  And that
extra money they have in the ir checking accounts will deplete probably by sometime mid -year next year.  And then, of course, you have
inflation, higher rates, higher mortgage rates, oil, volati lity, war. So, those things are out there and that – it's not a crack in current numbers. It's
quite predictable it will strain future numbers.",2022,3
3,2,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"And just tied to that, I think the other thing that investors from the outside worry about is interconnectedness of the system, b e it the UK gilts
market, LBOs. How much are you worried about that part of the business in terms of having a meaningful impact in terms of a capital shock at
some point over the next year, just given all the QT happening around the world?",2022,3
4,2,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, I mentioned QT as being one of the uncertainties because it's a very large change in the flow of funds around the world. Who are the
buyers and sellers of sovereign debt? There's a lot of sovereign debt. But I think if you look at the gilt thing alone , it’s a bump. It's not going to
change what we do or how we do it , and you're going to see bumps like that, because of all the things I have already mentioned. It's inevitable
that you're going to see them. Whether they create systemic risk, I don't know.
I have pointed out it's harder for ba nks to intermediate in that , and that creates a little bit more fragility in the system. That does not mean that
you're going to see a crack of some sort, but again , it's almost impossible not to have real volatility based on the facts we already told you.
Those are large uncertainties that we know about today and in the future.",2022,3
5,2,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,Got it. And great messaging on the call today. Thank you.,2022,3
0,3,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seapor t Global Securities,"Hey. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy . At the Investor Day, you noted that expense growth in 2023 would slow from this year's level and might be
slightly higher than consensus expectations at the time. So, is that – now that you get closer to next year, does that still hold? And if the
economy does get worse than expected, is there some levers to pull? Or is it just still investing heavily, regardless?",2022,3
1,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks, Jim. So, broadly, yes, it still hol ds. No real change on the outlook . Just to remind everyone , at Investor Day, I think the
consensus was $79.5 billion for 2023. We said you were a little low. I think it got revised up to sort of the $80.5 billion o r something like that,
and that's now stil l roughly in the right ballpark. Obviously, we're going through our budget cycle. We're looking at the opportunity set and th e
environment set for next year, so it's not set in stone.
But broadly, on the question of investment, and I'm sure Jamie will agr ee here, that our investment decisions are very much through -the-cycle
decisions. And so, we're not going to tend to change those just because of a sort of difference in the short -term economic environment. Of
course, the volume and revenue -related expense  can fluctuate as a function of the environment, as you would expect.",2022,3
2,3,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities,Right.,2022,3
3,3,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Now, I would just like to add, so obviously – I'd just like to add – obviously, compensation go up or down dramatically, so you'll have different
estimates about Investment Banking revenues and Markets revenues, and we can't really adjust for your numbers on that. But I just want to
point out the other side of this. We're making heavy investments, and we have among the best margins in the business. I think  that's a very
good thing.",2022,3
4,3,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities,"Right. And maybe on that front, leverage loan s write  – were there any leverage loan write -downs this quarter? And is that – and how do you –
is that market beginning to clear? Or are there still overhangs?",2022,3
5,3,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"There were no real leverage loan write -downs this quarter, an d that market isn't yet to clear.  We own – our share of it is very small, so we're
very comfortable.",2022,3
6,3,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities,Okay. Thanks.,2022,3
0,4,John E. McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, wanted to ask about your EaR disclosures, what we call your rate sensitivity disclosures. They look  a little different
than peers. And when we look at the sensitivity to 100 basis points of higher rates beyond the forward curve, it looks like you're liability
sensitive . Can you give us some context of maybe the limitations of that disclosure and how we should put that in context of the as sumptions
behind it?",2022,3
1,4,Jeremy B arnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks, John. And I'd love to have a very long conversation with you about this, but I'm going to keep it short here. I t's really all about
lags. So, as our disclosure says, we do not include the impact of reprice lags in our EaR calculation. So, as a result of that, the entire
calculation is based on modeled rates paid in the terminal state.
As you well know, right now, we're in the middle of some very significant lags, which are affecting the numbers quite a bit a nd which we expect
to persist for s ome time. So, as a result of that, what I would expect in the near term is something quite similar to what we've experienced this
year. As you know, this year, as rates have gone up, we've revised our NII outlook from $50 billion at the beginning of the y ear to now $61.5
billion. So, as we look forward in the near term from here, I would expect similar type sensitivities to rate fluctuations, g iven the lag
environment that we're in.",2022,3
2,4,John E. McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"And just to follow up on Jamie's comments about not ann ualizing the fourth quarter, is that where the risks lie to annualizing the fourth
quarter? What are some of the puts and takes – you said it might be down a little bit from that fourth quarter annualized.",2022,3
3,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Look, I've already mentioned you have a rapidly changing yield curve, deposit migration. Everyone does EaR differently.  So, one is lag .
One is we assume deposit migration; some people don't. Our ECR is included in  there; some people don't . And all o f that. I just think for your
models, because of all that kind of stuff, just use a number less than annualized in the $19 billion. So, instead of $76 bill ion, use a number like
$74 billion. And I just keep it as simple as possible. And we don't know. We h ope to beat that, but with all the stuff going on, you just got to be
a little cautious and conservative.",2022,3
4,4,John E. McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,Okay. Thanks.,2022,3
0,5,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Well, good morning. I agree with Ebrahim that your presentation this morning was quite crisp and impactful. So, I'm going to ask the question
that I think has been sort o f the key debate to the stock all year. So, at Investor Day in May, you mentioned a ROTCE target of 17% and that
was before we found out that the SCB would be higher in June. As we think about your capital build going faster than expected  and you think
about the revenue power that shows through in this firm, plus or minus what may happen with CECL, do you think you can achieve 1 7%
ROTCE next year?",2022,3
1,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, this is obviously a good question. The answer is yes. And one of the things we always look at is normalized ROTCE. So, we're very
honest. We're not overearning on NII, maybe a little bit because of lags and stuff like that, but not a lot, but we are overearning  on credit. Think
of credit card , the 1.5%, we've never seen a number that low. We're quite conscious of that. So, we don't brag about the 19% this quarter
thinking that's going to continue forever . It's not. And obviously we may adjust that 17% a little bit, but it's not a material adjustment.
We're going to find – we've got a lot of great bright people, and we're going to find a lot of ways to squeeze some of these things down,
including like CCAR and SCB and liquidate some assets and chang e business models just a little bit. If you look at our acquisition s, for
example, they were non -G-SIFI acquisitions. Non -capital, non -G-SIFI, all services and service -related.
So, that's what we're going to do over time, and we're pretty comfortable that  we'll get very good returns. So, yeah, we're quite – and next year
is totally dependent on what happens in the environment. But the other thing I would look at, maybe we'll give you this numbe r another  time, is
what would we earn in a recession . We would have pretty damn good returns in a recession. I mean, so I feel very good about that.",2022,3
2,5,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Thank you for that, Jamie. And this is a super -micro question as a follow -up for Jeremy. Why would Markets NII be zero next quarter, and
should we expect  that to be zero next year?",2022,3
3,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks, Erika.",2022,3
4,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"It's terrifically  simple . We're financing the Markets businesses at the yield curve, so you're earning the same thing you’re paying to finance the
trading book.",2022,3
5,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Erika, I mea n, basically as rates go up, the funding cost goes up and the offsets on the other side, in many cases, were through
derivatives or derivative -like instruments, so it goes through NIR. Fundamentally, we believe the Markets business revenue is rate insensit ive.
You can see that history through our disclosures this year. So, as you look out to next year with the forward curve implying a much less biased
evolution of Fed funds, you shouldn't expect to see as many changes , at least from rates. Of course, we can  sometimes see somewhat more
unpredictable changes from balances, but that should be unbiased one way or the other.",2022,3
6,5,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,Got it. Thanks.,2022,3
0,6,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Hi. Jamie, once again, I'm trying to reconcile your actions with your words. You've said publicly, you mentioned the hurrican e, you mentioned a
recession, you menti oned look out, and there  are all sorts of risks. I don't think anyone disagrees with that. On the other hand, your reserves -
to-loans are still well below CECL day one, so your actions with the reserving don't seem to reflect your more pessimistic comme nts about the
economy. So, how do I reconcile the two?",2022,3
1,6,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, so the way to do that is in our reserves today, there is a significant percentage probability that we put on adverse an d severe adverse
already, so it's in there already. A lot of people work in these CECL reserves, our economists, Jeremy, a lot of other folks. So, it's not set by
me because I happen to think that the odds might be different than other people . But I completely understand what you're saying , but the
numbers are very good. We have some of that.  I'm trying to be very honest about if things get worse, here is what it might mean  for reserves.
That may be different because, of course, these calculations change all the tim e...",2022,3
2,6,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,Yeah.,2022,3
3,6,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"The other thing, Michael, which is another thing , which in CECL, the  timing of when something happens is very important. So, if it happens – if
you said a recession is going to happen in the fourth quarter o f next year, that would be very different to you say it’s going to happen  in the
first quarter of next year.",2022,3
4,6,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Farg o Securities LLC,"Yeah, I just understood it as the lifetime losses on the loans as opposed to that...",2022,3
5,6,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"It is. But some loans – yes, but some loans have a short life and some loans have a long life.",2022,3
6,6,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Farg o Securities LLC,"So, let's just cut to the chase. Where are you versus three months ago? I mean, is it – you certainly got headlines with the hurricane comment
and all that. And it's – look, like as you said, you have debt tightening, QT, tighter capita l rules for banks, you have like the trifecta of tightening
by the Fed, and then you have wars and everything else, so I don't think anyone , and the stock market supports  your view about all the risks
out there. But are things better, worse, or the same as  they were three months ago?",2022,3
7,6,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"They're roughly the same. We're just getting closer to what you and I might consider bad events. And my hurricane, I've been very consistent .
But looking at probabilities and possibili ties, there is still, for example, a possibility of a soft landing. We can debate  what  we think that
percentage is. Yours might be different than mine, but there's a possibility of a mild recession. Consumers are in very good shape, companies
are in very good shape, and there’s a  possibility  of something worse, mostly because of the war in Ukraine and oil price and all t he things like
that. I would not change my possibilities and probabilities this quarter versus last quarter, for me.",2022,3
8,6,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Farg o Securities LLC,And then lastly...,2022,3
9,6,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,On a  different point. Yeah.,2022,3
10,6,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Yeah. Last follow -up. I know you invest through cycles. You've always done that, you're consistent, but I mean your headcount  increase is
probably going to be the highest in the industry. I mean head count from 266,000 to 288,000; your CIB, you're adding headcoun t. And if you
did expect weakness in nine months from now, wouldn't you wait to hire people? Maybe get them a little c heaper ?",2022,3
11,6,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,No.,2022,3
12,6,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.,2022,3
0,7,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,Hi. Good morning.,2022,3
1,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hey, Betsy.",2022,3
2,7,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Hi. A couple of questions. One, just on the investment spend, could you give us a sense as to the areas that you're leaning i n the most as we
should be thinking about into next year? Be cause you've obviously done a lot this year with regard s to technology advancement, companies
that you're buying to enhance your digital capabilities and international expansion, in particular, on  the consumer side. So, just thinking
through, is this a continuation on those themes or is there something else we should be looking for?",2022,3
3,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Betsy, it's exactly what we showed you at Investor Day, almost no change. So, take out that deck, we broke out by business, k ind of
investment, investment spend, tech spend . It’s pretty much on track for that.",2022,3
4,7,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"And the inflation that drives some of that cost structure, you can deal with through just efficiencies elsewhere, is that fai r?",2022,3
5,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorg an Chase & Co.,"Believe it or not, that was in the numbers we gave you in May.",2022,3
6,7,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Mor gan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Okay. And then separately on the bond restructuring that you did this quarter and the comments around, look, we don't need to  hold stuff we
don't need to hold, we don't want to hold, would that – that kind of suggests to me that th ere'll be more bond restructuring as we go through
the next quarter. Is there any reason why you didn't clean the whole thing up this quarter?",2022,3
7,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"No, I think I said we sell rich securities and buy cheap. So, you look  at – if you look  at what happened to mortgage spreads, they gapped out.
They gapped in, we bought; they gapped out, we sold, and that kind of stuff, getting 2 s, getting 2.5s. You could have different point of views,
but – and I do expect future bond losse s going forward.
I just don't think that's real earnings. So, I think – but I want our people, our experts in the investment area to know if they really want to sell
something, we're going to sell it. We're not going to sit here and lock ourselves into so mething that's gotten very, very rich because we feel like
we can't take a bond loss. And remember it doesn't affect capital. And, in fact, when you reinvest it, which we tend to do, w e actually have
higher earnings going forward.",2022,3
8,7,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,Okay. Thanks.,2022,3
0,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And let me just add too . Like you saw the CLOs gapped out in Europe . I want our people, when they gap out like 300 or 400 basis points, I
want them to be willing to buy. They might sell something to do that, but that is a very smart thing to do.",2022,3
1,8,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Okay. Thank you. This is Glenn. So, look, from time to time, weird things happen in the market. We get these losses like Archegos  and now
this UK pension LDI issue. So, my question for you is besides that, do you have risk in the derivatives book? And is t he done? It's more of
when you meet with risk committee, are there pockets of leverage that you're considering on these big market moves, whether i t be the dollar
or rates where we are not thinking of like a – or do you view the LDI issue as an isolated ev ent?",2022,3
2,8,Jamie Dimon,"C hief Executive Officer, Chairman",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hey. Yeah, hi. I'll mention , and, Jeremy, you might have something to add. So, the LDI thing is a bump in the road , and I think that the Bank of
England is also trying to get through this thing without changi ng all the policy about monetary policy and QT. And I was surprised to see how
much leverage there was in some of those pension plans. And my experience in life has been when you have things like what we' re going
through today, there are going to be other surprises. Someone is going to be offsides.
We don't see anything that looks systemic, but there is leverage in certain credit portfolios . There's leverage in certain companies, there's
leverage – so you're probably going to see some of that. I do think y ou're going to see volatile markets. You already see very low liquidity, so
something like the LDI thing could cause more issues down the road, if it happens constantly and stuff like that. But so far,  it's a bump in the
road. The banking system itself is extraordinarily strong.",2022,3
3,8,Glenn  Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Would the dollar qualify as one of those super -strong moves that could put people offsides? And if so, how do you make sure you protect
JPMorgan against that?",2022,3
4,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, we're not taking them . We generally hedge when it comes to big currencies and stuff like that. But yes, dollar flows, QT, emerging
markets, hedge funds, yes, that would be a category that might – something might happen there. It wouldn't be – it shouldn't be somethi ng
that's going to affect JPMorgan that much. In fact, it usually creates an opportunity for JPMorgan.",2022,3
5,8,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercor e ISI,All right. Thanks.,2022,3
6,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, on that point, Glenn, I was going to say the same thing what was traditionally the case that emerging markets struggle,  sovereigns
struggle with the kind of dollar strength that we're expe riencing right now, but our emerging markets franchise folks have been through these
cycles before, so we manage through it.",2022,3
7,8,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,Thank you both. Appreciate it.,2022,3
8,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I mean just to add to the strength of the franchise, I remember looking back at our emerging markets results by quarter over a decade. It was
shocking to me how few quarters and how few countries, we ever lost mon ey. We may have had low returns in some quarters, but it was
shocking. We made money in Argentina almost every year for the last 20 years, and I think there was one quarter we put up res erves for one
of the oil companies and took them down, but it's kind o f very – the stability is striking.",2022,3
0,9,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Thank you. Good morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie. You guys have been talking about the system, the liquidity with – Jamie, you
referenced QT, also the fragility of the system. Can you share with us what are the metrics you guys are looking at to see if  the system does
have a problem on liquidity? Just this week you probably saw that the Swiss National Bank upped its res erve currency swap lines to $6.3
billion. So, what are some of the things you guys focus in on to see if there's going to be maybe more – some liquidity issues that could lead to
greater problems?",2022,3
1,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, Gerard, bro adly, if you just look at standard regulatory reporting of LCR ratios in the US banking system, everyone just has very
significant surpluses. And, of course, we can go into the question of as QT plays through and how that interacts with RRP  and loan growth ,
whether that puts some pressure on banking system deposits, but that's starting from a very, very strong position. So, there' s a lot of cushion
there for that to come down before you start to have a real challenge from a liquidity perspective.",2022,3
2,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And we look at everything from the Fed repo to quantitative tightening to net issuance of treasuries, net issuance of m ortgages, and
treasury volatility and treasury bid/ask spreads and treasury markets and all that, we're looking at all of that. The banking system itself is
extremely strong, extremely strong. It is not – what you're going to see will not be in the banking – and there may be a bankers offsides
somewhere , but it'll be somewhere else. It'll be somewhere else. It might be in credit, it might be in emerging markets, it might be in FX, but
you're likely to have something like that when you have events like the ones we're talking about.",2022,3
3,9,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Very good. And then in terms of the Investment Banking and Capital Markets businesses, can you guys give us any color into pipelines ? How
they stood at the end of the third quarter , and as you're going into the fourth quarter, what you're seeing in terms of those business lines?",2022,3
4,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Of ficer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And I've always pointed out to you all , the pipelines come and go, okay? You've seen that the size we ’ve never had before. So, pipeline
is not necessary to see . I would put in your model , lower IB revenues next quarter than this quarter based on what we see today. Markets, we
have no idea. Seasonally, it's generally a low quarter in the fourth quarter, but we don't know this quarter because there's so much activity
taking place, and your guess is as good as ours.",2022,3
5,9,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,Very fair. Thank you.,2022,3
0,10,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Can you guys talk about the outlook for loan growth the next few quarters? And besides some of the obvious areas like leverag e lending and
correspondent mortgage you already talked about, any areas that you're tightening around the edges?",2022,3
1,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chie f Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Matt, let me take your last question first. So, in general, no, we underwrite through the cycle. We haven't – we didn't really loosen our
underwriting standards in the moment where everything looked great.  And so, we don't see any need to tighten now. Really, a lot of
consistency there. In terms of the actual loan growth outlook, we had said for this year, obviously  only one quarter left , that we'd have high -
single digits. No meaningful change to that outlo ok there, probably a little bit of a headwind as a function of rates as you mentioned and some
of the RWA optimization in mortgages.
As we go into next year, we remain very positive and optimistic about the Card story across a range of dimensions in terms  of both
outstandings and revolve r normalization. But for the rest of the loan growth environment, it's going to be, I think very dependent , especially in
wholesale , on the macro situation. We know that in recessionary environments, we tend to see lower lo an demand. At the same time, we've
got a lot of great initiatives going and client engagement and new clients, so we'll just have to see how that plays out next  year.",2022,3
2,10,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"And I guess when we read the headlines about home prices going down in some markets and car prices starting to roll, I mean why doesn't
that drive some tightening in those businesses?",2022,3
3,10,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, it has. I mean, look at , the volumes in mortgage have dropped, and cars quota  have dropped and stuff like that. And that's already in our
numbers , and we would expect that to continue that way.",2022,3
4,10,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,Okay. Thank you.,2022,3
0,11,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,Portales Partners,"Yeah. I'm just curious in your guidance on NII where you kind of implied fourth quarter would be peak run rate. Next year, do  you factor in any
impact f rom a possible treasury buyback program which could redirect liquidity out of the money market system into the banking system , and,
therefore, keep your deposit betas lower? Do you think about that at all as a possibility?",2022,3
1,11,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yes. I think I – I don't know if you were listening when I said it before. QT, net issuance of mortgages, net issuance of treasuries globally is
going to reduce deposits and create certain forms of volatility, and absolutely we incorporate that o n our thinking including lags, the change in
the yield curve, change in spreads and all those things in the numbers we gave you. And that's why we're trying to be conserv ative with NII ,
that while you can annualize the $19 billion to $76 billion, if you ha ve a model, put in $74 billion , and it incorporates all of that.",2022,3
2,11,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,Portales Partners,Thank you.,2022,3
3,11,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,You're welcome.,2022,3
0,12,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, thank you very much and we'll talk to you all next quarter.",2022,3
1,12,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Thank you.,2022,3
0,1,John E. McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Hi. Good morning, Jeremy. I wanted to ask about the NII outlook slide 10. The range of outcomes on deposit  costs is quite wide, as you
mentioned. It looks like 1.5% to 2% demonstrated there. Does the $74 billion NII line up with kind of the midpoint of that? M aybe you could
give some color about kind of the drivers of the $74 billion and where that lines up on  this range of deposit cost outcomes.",2022,4
1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure, John. I mean, I wouldn't take the chart on the bottom left too literally. That's just supposed to give a stylized indic ation of the fact that
relatively small changes in deposit rate paid for the company on average, as you well know, can produce quit e significant impacts on the NII.
And also that there's, as we've already talked about, a meaningful range of possible outcomes for the year -ahead as the deposit reprice path
remains uncertain.
The outlook is our best guess, as Jamie says, and the drivers within that are the usual drivers. In Wholesale, we would expect to see a little bit
of continued attrition, especially of the non -operating type balances, and you're going to see some internal migration there out of non -interest -
bearing into inter est-bearing over time.
In Consumer, CDs are flowing right now, and we're seeing good new CD production. We've got a 4% CD in the market as of this m orning. And
so continued CD production, and internal migration there will be a driver. And the rest of it i s – well, and, of course, as I said in the prepared
remarks, we do expect – across the company – modest deposit attrition as we look forward as a function of QT and the rate cycle and so on.
So we've got best guesses for all of those in the outlook, and o f course, the actual outcome will be different in one way or another and we'll
just run the business this year.",2022,4
2,1,John E. McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Okay. Thanks. And on buybacks, how will you think about approaching buybacks and putting it in that mix of capital decisions that you have
and any thoughts on kind of the size or quantifying the potential buybacks?",2022,4
3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So, sort of in the mode of like helping you g uys out to put a number in the model, if you sort of look at the way we're seeing things,
obviously, we've got another GSIB step coming next year. So, say, a 13.5% target and the sort of using your estimates, organi c capital
generation, minus dividends, et  cetera, and all of the elements of uncertainty there, I think a good number to use is something like $12 billion
of buybacks for this year for 2023.
But you know, of course, that buybacks are always at the end of our capital hierarchy. So if we have bett er uses for the money, those will
come first, and the timing and the conditions of how much we do when is entirely at our discretion, and also noting that we a re potentially
going to see a Basel III NPR sometime in the first quarter, or maybe in the second  quarter. And while that will be an NPR, and it will only cover
part of the surface area and it won't be final, so it's unlikely that it meaningfully shapes short -term decision -making – there will be some
information content of that release that could shap e our decisions as well.",2022,4
4,1,John E. McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,Got it. Thank you.,2022,4
0,2,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is just, as you can imagine, following up on the NII line of questioning, appreciate that there is a
significant amount of uncertainty in this year's NII forecast in particular. But to follow up with John's question, I'm wondering if you could give
us sort of more specific guardrails with regards to what you're expecting for deposit attrition and deposit beta in terms of the terminal deposit
beta.
I think the feedback I'm getting very early from investors is that they app reciate the headwinds that's occurring for NII this year. At the same
time, you have been consistently beating what seemed like conservative NII expectations for 2022, including printing a giant $20.3 billion
number in the fourth quarter. So that's why I t hink the more specific guardrails could be very helpful as investors try to figure out what their
own expectations are versus that.",2022,4
1,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Erika. So, look, I totally appreciate the desire fo r more specific guardrails. I would want that too, if I were you. I do think that we're
trying to be quite helpful by giving you a full year number which, if we're honest, involves a lot of guessing about how thin gs will evolve
throughout the year.
I think once you start giving guardrails, you implicitly assume that outcomes outside of the guardrails are very unlikely – and that's just a level
of precision that we're just not prepared to get into, especially because in the end, as I said, a lot of the repricing decisions that we'll be faced
with as a company are respond to data in the moment at a granular level in connection with a strategy, which is about growing  and maintaining
primary bank relationships rather than chasing every dollar of balances at  any cost. So, in that context, we do expect modest balance attrition
across the company for deposits, as I said.
Jamie, you want to add something ?",2022,4
2,2,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Erika, I just want to give a big picture about why I do not consider $74 billion conservative. So the Federal Reserve reduced  its balance sheet
by $400 billion. $1.5 trillion came out of bank deposits. And so investors can invest in T -bills, money market f unds, and of course, banks are
competing for the capital money now and banks are all in a different place. And some banks have started to compete heavily. S ome have a lot
of excess cash and maybe compete less.
But if you look at prior – and forget what ha ppened in 2016 – I think people make a huge mistake looking at that. We've never had zero rates.
We've never had rates go up this fast. So I expect there will be more migration to CDs, more migration to money market funds.  A lot of people
are there competi ng for it and we're going to have to change savings rates. We can do it at our own pace and look at what other people are
doing. We don't know the timing, but it will happen.
And I just also want to point out that even at $74 billion, we're earning quite good returns. We've always pointed out to you all that sometimes
we're over -earning and sometimes we're under -earning. I would say, okay, this time we're over -earning on NII this quarter. We're maybe over -
earning on credit. We may be under -earning on somet hing else. So these are still very good numbers and we're going to wait and see and
we'll report to you. But I don't want to give you false notions how secure it is.",2022,4
3,2,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"And my follow -up is exactly in that line of questioning. Let's zoom out for a second here – to your point, Jamie, the returns are still good. You
mentioned that your outlook already captures a mild recession, and I'm going to re -ask the question I asked in the third quarter. As you think
about 2023, do you think JPMorgan can hit that 17% ROTCE that you laid out in Investor Day even with the headwind in NII and the  headwind
in the  provision?",2022,4
4,2,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yes, we can. But a lot of factors determine that. But yes, w e can. I think when we do Investor Day in May, we may give you a more interesting
number, which is what do we think our ROTCE will be if we have a real recession. Which, I think even in a real recession, it would probably
equal the average industrial compa ny – which is good. So we're going to give you some detail around that, and those are still good returns,
and we can still grow. And remember, 17% is very good if you can compound – some growth at 17%. Those are extraordinary numbers. And I
also want to po int out we don't know exactly what capital needs to be at this point, and we have to modify that at one point.",2022,4
5,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And, Erika, let me just add a very minor clarifying point. I just want to be crystal clear about this. So, as y ou know and as we discussed a lot
through the pandemic, in terms of the way we construct and build the allowance, while it's anchored around our economist cent ral case
forecast, which as you correctly say is a mild recession, through the way we weight the different scenarios and a range of other factors, the de
facto scenario that's embedded in the forecast is actually more conservative than that from an allowance perspective. So we j ust want to be
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co. A
clear about that.",2022,4
6,2,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS S ecurities LLC,Perfect. Thank you.,2022,4
0,3,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Good morning. I guess maybe, Jeremy, just following up on the credit assumptions underlying  – if you cou ld give us a sense of what's
assumed in that reserve ratio at the end of the year, be it in terms of the unemployment rate, and your outlook around just a  lot of chatter
around commercial real estate, the struggles to reprice in the current rate backdrop. Are you concerned about that? Are you seeing pain points
in CRE customers given what's happening with cap rates and then just overall backlog today?",2022,4
1,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Let me just do CRE quickly, Ebrahim. As you know, our sort of multi -family commercial term lending business is really quite different
from the classic office type business. Our office portfolio is very small, Class A best developers, best locations. So the va st majority of the loan
balances in Commercial Real Estate are t hat sort of affordable multi -family housing, commercial term lending stuff, which is really quite secure
from a credit perspective for a variety of reasons. So we feel quite comfortable with the loss profile of that business.
And so then you were asking about the assumptions in credit overall. So,  as I said, the central case economic forecast has a mild recession,
and if I remember correctly, unemployment peaking at something like 4.9%. The adjustments that we make to the scenarios to re flect sligh tly
more conservative outlook have us imply a peak unemployment that's notably higher than that.
So I think we have appropriately conservative assumptions about the outlook embedded in our current balances. And the traject ory that we've
talked about in th e presentation, they definitely can capture something more than a very mild soft landing. But, of course, it wouldn't be
appropriate to reflect a full -blown hard landing in our current numbers since the probability of that is clearly well below 100%.",2022,4
2,3,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank  of America Merrill Lynch,"Noted. And I guess just as a follow -up – you've managed RWA growth pretty well – when you look at loan growth year -over-year versus RWA,
stayed relatively flat. As we think about just managing capital, how should we think about the evolution of RWA? Are there still opportunities to
optimize that going into whatever the Fed comes out with on Basel? Thank you.",2022,4
3,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So there are definitely still opportunities to optimize. We're continuing to work very hard and it's a big area of focus. Some of that is
reflected in this quarter's numbers, but some of the other drivers of this quarter are what you might call more passive items , particularly in
market risk RWA. And yeah, but we shou ld be clear that although we've said that the effects of capital optimization are not a material
economic headwind for the company, they're also not zero. There are real consequences due to the choices that we're making as  a result of
this capital environm ent. And in a Basel III outcome that is unreasonably punitive from a capital perspective, there will be additional
consequences  that we obviously are hoping that's not the case and believe that it's not appropriate, but we'll see what happens.",2022,4
4,3,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of Ame rica Merrill Lynch,Noted. Thank you.,2022,4
0,4,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Hi. Thank you. I'm curious – I want to talk leveraged loans for a second. You've done a good job avoiding some of these – putting on these –
loans for the better half of the last half year. So good call on your part. Things have gotten a lot cheaper. Howev er, bank balance sheets, not
yours, are still kind of mucky -ed up with a lot of the back book. I'm curious to see if things have gotten cheap enough. Do you consider
yourself back in? And how important is this in general for activity levels to pick back up to have available funding from the big banks?",2022,4
1,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. A couple things there, Glenn. So short answer is we're absolutely open for business there. Terms are better. Pricing is  better. We have
the resources needed. We'r e fully there. No overhang, no issue.
Also, I think there's a bit of a narrative that like activity in the market needs to overcome overhang. We're not convinced t hat that's true. We
think that the overhang is in the numbers and people need to look forwar d and the system has the capacity to handle the risks. So I recognize
your point, I think it's an interesting point, but we are wide open for business and not particularly concerned about the ove rhang from the
perspective of bank's ability to finance activ ity.",2022,4
2,4,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Ev ercore ISI,"Interesting. So maybe a bid-ask thing,  more so. Okay. Maybe, Jamie, while we have you, in the last annual letter, you talked about low
competitive moats and intense competition from all angles, not just fintech. And I was just trying to think out loud. Is that  better or worse, that
competitive  landscape, in a much higher rate backdrop? Maybe I'll just leave it at that to see where you go with it.",2022,4
3,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"No. I think it's the same. You have the Apples who are basically doing a lot of banking services and Walmar t starting theirs. And obviously,
higher rates will hurt some of the folks in the fintech world and maybe even help some of the folks. So we expect tough compe tition going
forward.",2022,4
4,4,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,Okay. Thanks.,2022,4
0,5,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Thank you. Hi, Jeremy.",2022,4
1,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hey, Gerard.",2022,4
2,5,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Jeremy, you mentioned in your Payments business that if you took out the equity investment write -downs, the growth was over 50%. Can you
share with us on the equity write -downs, obviously, private equity is going through some challen ging times and I'm assuming...",2022,4
3,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,It was a gain last year. It wasn't a write -down this year.,2022,4
4,5,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Oh, I got it. Okay. I thought there was a write -down there. Okay.",2022,4
5,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,I want to make that clear. Sorry about that.,2022,4
6,5,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Very good. Thank you, Jamie. Sticking just with private equity for a moment, can you share with us where the risks are in the private equity
markets to JPMorgan – when you think about it from your loan book? Or is it really just in equity investments? And maybe expand upon that.",2022,4
7,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Offi cer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sorry. Do you want me to take that Gerard? So just a couple of things. So, Jamie is right, the headwind year -on-year is primarily a function of
the fact that this is an investment that – just because of the management alternati ve accounting standard – we were forced to mark up
previously. This is an investment that we got payment in kind as part of the sale of some of our internally developed initiat ives. So anyway, it's
fine.
The point is there is a small write -down this quart er. And the important point there is that the core business is performing exceptionally well,
both because of higher rates, but also because of the strategy that Takis talked a lot at Investor Day paying off across fees  and value -added
services and so on a nd so forth.
And I guess, Gerard, your question is like private equity in general and how are we feeling about that space, did I hear that  correctly?",2022,4
8,5,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC C apital Markets LLC,"That's correct, Jeremy. And just in terms of any lending, obviously, so many of these companies have seen their valuations co me down
considerably. Is there any elevated risk lending to some of these companies considering the struggles  they're having?",2022,4
9,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, I think that's a risk that we manage quite tightly as a company, our exposures to the sort of non -bank financial sector, broadly
defined. And of course, as – we thought a little bit about what normalized Whol esale charge -offs could look like through the cycle. They're
obviously higher than effectively zero, which is what we have now. But we feel confident with our credit discipline and what we have on the
books.",2022,4
10,5,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC C apital Markets LLC,"Great. And then as a follow -up question, you guys did a good job building up that loan loss reserve this quarter. Two questions to that. First,
the Shared National Credit exam results are always released in February. Does the reserve buildup take some of that into account? And
second, how much of the reserve build was more of a management overlay versus your base case, the quantitative part of the de cision
making for building up the reserve?",2022,4
11,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, I mean, I'll give you that answer, but I'm oversimplifying a lot. I would say that...",2022,4
12,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Oversimplifying.,2022,4
13,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Yeah. No, I got it. The sort of conservatism of the management overlay did not change for all intents and purposes quar ter-on-quarter. I
think that's the best way to think about that, Gerard.",2022,4
14,5,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Oh. And the Shared National – yeah, go ahead.",2022,4
15,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,The National Shared Credit thing will not affect our results materially.,2022,4
16,5,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC C apital Markets LLC,"Very good. Thank you, Jamie.",2022,4
0,6,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Just wondering if you can help us understand the ongoing efforts on your mitigation for the RWAs in  advance of all
the points you've made already about the pending capital regime. Can you help us understand what type of eff ects that has, if any, on parts of
the income statement, whether it's NII or the Trading business?",2022,4
1,6,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, if I just take that one, just assume we're going to have modest growth in RWA and in every single business  – mortgages, loans,
derivatives – how we hedge CVA and  stuff like that. We take actions to manage RWA. It does not really affect the business that much. It might
one day, but it doesn't affect it today.
Jamie Dimon
Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A
And so, we don't build in – somehow we lose a little bit of this, a little bit of that. And the biggest opportunity down the road would be a
reopening of the securitization markets. They're still very tight. And I think one day they will reopen.",2022,4
2,6,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Okay. And then on the – one fol low-up. Just coming back to the reserving process. Can you just help us understand relative to the 5% peak in
3Q that you gave for your unemployment rate quarterly average and that 3.9% average baseline, where does this fourth quarter reserve get
you to? And just does that rule of thumb that you kind of gave us last quarter still stand in terms of scenario analysis on potential  builds ahead
of this mild recession?",2022,4
3,6,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Can I just make it real simple? The base case, okay, is where it hits almost that 5% unemployment. Then you probability -weight other
scenarios. That's why Jeremy is saying the reserve is higher than the base case. We didn't change the probability scenario we ighting.
But, of course, it got worse since the base case got worse. That's all it is. Which still is a good benchmark, for you all to keep in mind is if
we've got to a relative adverse case – call that a 6% unemployment – and then once you get there you assume the average weighting – you
have  wings. It could get better or it could get worse. At that case, we would need about $6 billion more.
When the base case itself deteriorates, we're moving closer to relative adverse. That's all it is. These are all probabilitie s and possibilities and
hypo thetical numbers. And if I were you, I'd just look at charge -offs, like actual results. And we break this out, but it's hard to describe, and
every bank does this slightly differently and every bank has a slightly different base case and a slightly differe nt weighting of adverse cases, et
cetera. And so, we're just trying to make it as simple as possible.",2022,4
4,6,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Yeah, I hear you. The challenge this time is that we're going to have the income statement effect way ahead of that charge -off. So, we're all
trying to just fit for that. But I appreciate that. Thanks, Jamie.",2022,4
5,6,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And once the ME V base case gets to where you expect relative adverse, you'll be adding the $6 billion of reserves before you have charge -
offs.",2022,4
6,6,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,Exactly. Right.,2022,4
7,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And again, and maybe just out of interest – implied in your question might be a little bit – to what extent does this quarter's build sort of, is a
down payment on the $6 billion. And the answer to that question is, much less than all of it because a lot of it was driven b y loan growth. But
since some of it, as Jam ie says, is driven by the flow -through of the downward revision of the central case, you could say – subject to the
caveat that this is a little bit art, not science – that there's some down payment on the $6 billion.",2022,4
8,6,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,Yes. Understood. Thank you for all that.,2022,4
0,7,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morg an Stanley & Co. LLC,"I wanted to understand a little bit about how you're thinking about managing the expense line as you go through this year. I know we talked
already about how it's hard to predict NII, obviously Markets has pushes and pulls. Can you help us understand how you're thinking about
delivering operating leverage, where the elements of the expense base are needing to be invested in so you really can't touch , and where
there are opportunities to potentially peel back such that if you get a we aker rev line you can still deliver positive operating leverage?",2022,4
1,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. So, I mean, as you know, obviously, we tend to break down our expenses across our three categories. And in some sense, the category
that you're addressing is the volume - and revenue -related expense, which we highligh t because it should, pretty symmetrically, respond to a
better or worse environment and thereby contribute to operating leverage.
So, for example, in this year's ultimate outcome and the number that we wound up printing for 2022, the year -on-year change i n volume - and
revenue -related expense, we're still refining the numbers, we'll probably show you more at Investor Day, but is probably close to $1 billion – in
other words, year -on-year decline. Whereas next year we're assuming something more like flat. So , while the sort of year -on-year dollar
change in the outlook sort of 2021 to 2022, 2022 to 2023 is comparable, the mix is quite different actually.
And so, for example, if we wound up being wrong about the type of environment that we're budgeting for, you would expect a significant drop
in the volume - and revenue -related expense number that's in the current outlook, and that would contribute to operating leverage. For the rest
of it, we're always generating efficiency, and we've worked ju st as hard at that whether the revenue environment is good or bad.
And as you know, we invest through the cycle. And so, broadly, our investment plans really shouldn't be that sensitive to sho rt-term changes
in the environment. Of course, certain types of  things like marketing investments in the Card business in particular, the math of what we
expect the NPV of those things to be through the cycle may change in a downturn, and that could produce lower investment, all  else equal.
But the core strategic inve stments that we're making to secure the future of the company are not going to get modified because of the ups and
downs of the environment.",2022,4
2,7,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Okay. And part of the reason for asking is one of the debate points on JPMorgan's stock ha s been around the capital charges, the capital
margin, will capital be a bigger burden for you to bear as we go through the next couple of years. As you deliver on the posi tive operating
leverage side, it gives you room to absorb some more capital, obvious ly, and still hit those IRR and ROTCE targets on incremental
investments.
Maybe you could help us understand what level of capital increase you could absorb given the operating leverage you're expect ing to
generate. And maybe that's an unfair question tod ay and it's a better question for Investor Day, but that's kind of the debate that's out there on
the stock.",2022,4
3,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I get it. I get it. I mean it's a fair question, it's a good question. I'm not going to answer it super specifically, and Jamie may have some views
here, too. But let me just quickly say we've kind of said that we feel quite confident about this company's ability to genera te 17% through the
cycle, and that's incorporating our sense of the current environment , the operating leverage that you talked about, and the expectation of
higher capital requirements with the 13.5% target in the first quarter of 2024.
The question of whether Basel III end game and other factors increase that number and how much of that w e can absorb and still produce
those returns is, of course, impossible to answer right now, but I would remind you that it's not just denominator expansion.  Unreasonable
capital outcomes will increase costs into the real economy which goes into the numerat or, too. It's not what we want, but that is a possible
outcome.",2022,4
4,7,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,Thank you.,2022,4
0,8,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Farg o Securities LLC,"Hi. Yeah. I recognize you're evolving your business model and you're spending money to make more money and that your track re cord last
decade was strong there. But as it relates to the Frank acquisition that's been in the news, I'm just  wondering what that says about the
financial discipline for the 15 deals that you pursued, the $7 billion of investing each year, and the one -fifth increase in expenses over three
years to your guide of $81 billion in 2023. So, it's really a question abou t financial discipline. And I know you can't go into details on the Frank
deal, and, look, you earn the purchase price in two days. Okay. So, I get that.
And if there's fraud  – you can't do anything about fraud, but still it diverts management resources a nd attention. So, maybe, just in the
specifics, as it relates to the acquisition strategy, like who sources them? Who negotiates them? Who does the due diligence?  Who runs it?
And ultimately who is accountable for all these 15 different deals? And when you 're having investments going across business lines, which is
a strength of you guys, but who is ultimately accountable when these investments don't go the way you want to?
And, Jamie, you recognized a couple years ago at Investor Day, you said, look, some times you're going to waste money as you're innovating
and you're growing. But ultimately who is accountable when an investment doesn't go right, like the Frank deal or another deal or some of the
other $81 billion that you expect to spend this year?",2022,4
1,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Obviously, Mike, that's a very good question which we ’re always concern ed about  – because we've always talked about complacency
and all things like that. So, obviously, when you're getting up to bat 300 times a year, you are going to have errors. And we  don't want our
company  to be terrified of errors that we don't do anything and that  the complacency is then burdened by bureaucracy which is stasis and
death. So, you have to be very careful when you make an error like you’re going to cripple the firm.
We are very disciplined, and you see that in a lot of different ways. You see it in o ur leverage lending book. You see it in the success of our
investments. You see it in the quality of our products and services. You see it in all these things. And there's no differenc e for an acquisition.
There are – so the acquisitions are done by the bu sinesses, but there's also a centralized team that does extensive due diligence. So, the
business does it. The centralized team does it. We've been doing it for 20 years, wasn’t like we just started doing something  like that. And,
obviously, there are alwa ys lessons learned.
And at one point, we'll tell you the lessons learned here when this thing is out of litigation, but we're quite comfortable. And the people who are
responsible are the people in the business. So, if that business did the acquisition, t hey are responsible. They report back, and we expect
people when they talk to all of us is the good, the bad, the ugly. We're never looking for how great everything was. And obvi ously, this thing, in
one way or another, was a huge mistake.",2022,4
2,8,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Let me follow up on that. So, that relates to the inorganic growth. As it relates to the organic growth, such as in the Payme nts business, which
I know is a focus – that cuts across a lot of different business lines. So, as you invest more in Payments, whi ch can be a 20 or 30 P/E
business, which could be great if you got there – who is responsible for that sort of organic investment that cuts across? Sometimes the way
you aggregate the data, it's Consumer, it's to the Investment Bank, it could be Asset Mana gement, it could be Commercial, it could be
everything in the Payments. Who's responsible for those?",2022,4
3,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So, just to be clarified, so I would say that Marianne and Jenn, when it comes to credit, debit, checks, and all the consumer -related stuff. And
Takis, which I think, you saw the presentation about Payments at Investor Day, reporting to Daniel, and that is  on the Wholesale Payments,
Merchant processing, a whole bunch of stuff. And those are direct responsibilities. It's quite clear this is an area that cut s across the company.
So, there is a  Payments working group that just spends time on that.
That working group has not done an acquisition, okay? And if they want to invest , which there are cases by the way , and you'll see more this
year, they’re decided jointly, and all the way up to Daniel and me.",2022,4
4,8,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"And then last follow -up to my fi rst start, the general comment. I mean, this is the third year in a row of about $5 billion of expense growth. And
you have slide 11 there, but I mean, that's a lot of certain front -loaded expenses for less certain back -ended benefits. How's your comfort l evel
that you're going to see those back -ended benefits, relative to the past?",2022,4
5,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Totally. And we tried to show you guys at Investor Day. For every branch we open, for every banker we hire, for every tech th ing we do, we're
pretty comfortable. There are certain things more like infrastructure, like getting to the cloud and stuff like that, which you can't identify all of
that. But we're pretty comfortable. And if they weren't working, we ’d change them.
So, we ask ourselves that question every day – when you're adding wealth managers or branches  or certain things. And marketing is half of
that, not quite half, but half of that number. That's a very specific, for the most part, a very specific dollar in, how many  dollars out. Not a
guess. And we're pretty accurate at that kind of stuff. And again,  if there's $1 billion that we were spending didn't give us the return, we would
cut the billion.",2022,4
6,8,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,All right. Thank you.,2022,4
0,9,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Hi. Good morning. So, wanted to start off with a question on the outlook for Trading and the Investment Banking businesses. J ust, Jeremy,
given the strong pipelines you cited, was hoping you can provide some additional color just in terms of what you're hearing from corporate
clients, especially in the context of the mild recession scenario you outlined, when you would expect to see some inflection in Invest ment
Banking activity. And similar question on the Trading side – you're facing difficult comps in the coming year, we still have QT, rate volatility
proxy is still elevated. Do you anticipate a significant moderation in Trading activity or not?",2022,4
1,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Thanks, Steve. So, let's do Banking first. So, I think the thing that's interesting about banking  right now is that the declines have been so
significant, obviously from very elevated levels, but even relative to just 2019, 2022 was a relatively weak year. And as we look into 2023, it's
possible that the actual economic environment will be worse than it was in 2022. So, that could conceivably make you pessimistic about the
Investment Banking wallet outlook. And to be sure, it's not as if we're super optimistic.
But it's important to note that part of the issue here is how quickly things changed in 202 2, specifically with respect to rates, as that affects the
debt business and valuations as it affects M&A and ECM as well. And one of the sort of necessary conditions for people to do deals or decide
to raise capital is just getting comfortable with valuat ions in the open market. So, I think there's a chance that that actually winds up helping in
2023 in the Investment Banking wallet. Of course, we don't know, but those are some of the things that we're thinking about.
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer , JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A
Similarly, on the Markets side, obviously Markets had another very strong year, better than we'd expected. Since the numbers were so strong
coming out of the pandemic, we were expecting more normalization than what we actually saw . And 2022 had a lot of themes. I think the
active management community did well. That always helps us a little bit. And we had volatility with relatively orderly and continued Markets .
As we look towards 2023, maybe some of those themes will be a little bit less obvious and that could be a little bit of a headwind. But on the
other hand, it's not like the volatility is going away, and Markets seem to continue to be quite orderly. And a 4.5%, 5% rate  environment is
probably one where there's more tr ading opportunities than a 0% rate environment.
So, of course, we don't know. We'll see. I think you would have to probably expect some normalization there. The numbers are really very
strong in Markets. But we'll see. We'll see what happens.",2022,4
2,9,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"That's really helpful color. And just for my follow -up on finalization of Basel III, sorry Jeremy, I couldn't help myself here. But in Barr's
December speech, he strongly hinted at capital requirements moving higher for you and peers. You a lso alluded in your comments, or in a
response to one of the questions, that the finalization of Basel III can potentially be very punitive.
Given the absence of the proposal, I was really just hoping you could speak to how you're scenario planning for th e eventual finalization and
any additional detail you can offer on the areas of mitigation. I think the one issue or area of confusion is that one of the  biggest sources of
RWA inflation is op risk, which can't really be mitigated. So, what are the actions  that you can take to really offset some of those potential
headwinds?",2022,4
3,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, Steve, I'd love to get into a whole lot of detail here. But I just think that the question of how to mitigate is re ally hard to discuss in a
lot of detail until we see an actual proposal. And the reason that we talk about potentially punitive increases of you studyi ng this issue closely
is, just to point out, that under the version of the world where you get the worst outcome in al l of the different moving parts of this thing – it’s a
very significant increase to the capital requirements of the system as a whole. And given how strong the system is today, tha t just like doesn't
make sense to us. So, we just want to say that. But yeah , Jamie, please.",2022,4
4,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I mean just, look, you guys know the operating risk , capital , the trading book, the CCAR, G -SIFI, all those moving parts. Let's just see what
they are. We'll deal with them when we get there, and then we'll figure  out what we have to modify our business and stuff like that. We don't
think it's necessary to increase capital ratios. We're quite clear on that.
One of the new numbers we put on the top of the press release was our Total Loss Absorbing Capacity. So, we have now almost $500 billion.
I mean, really, like at one point, when is $500 billion of that, of $1 trillion liquidity, are all those things enough? But l et's just see what it is.
They're going to work it through. There are international laws, there are i nternational requirements. We're hoping that America is the same as
international. That would be nice. G -SIFI is supposed to be corrected. We'll see if that happens. So, let's just see. We don't have to guess. And
if the number's too high, we're going to t ell you what we're going to do about it.",2022,4

6,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Steve, just a very minor expansion of that, just to expand a bit on Jamie's point , it's important to be clear, there will be time to adjust. Like
there's a long road from the NPR – that sort of supports Jamie's point. Let's see what it is and then we'll...",2022,4
7,9,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,Fair enough.  Thanks so much for taking my questions.,2022,4
0,10,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Good morning. How are you guys thinking about managing the securities book given the outlook of lower deposits? Obviously, th e yield curve
is quite inverted depending on what part you're looking at or most parts, frankly. And then at the same time, the securities boo k is cash flowing
a lot less than it was a couple years ago, just given the rate environment.",2022,4
1,10,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yes. Remember, the securities book is an outcome of investing in basically excess deposits. And you have like $2.4 trillion d eposits and $1
trillion of loans and things like that. And we manage it to manage interest rate exposure, all these various things.
And then when you say the size of it, we forecast – which I'm not going to give you the numbers – we forecast every quarter what we're going
to buy, what we're going to sell, how much is coming in, how much we need for liquidity, and we ad just it all the time based upon deposits
coming down and loans and stuff like that. Obviously, what you get to invest in is at much higher rates today. And you see JP Morgan's loss in
the HTM loan book as a percent is much lower than most other people. We'r e kind of conservative there, too.",2022,4
2,10,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"I guess a bigger picture question – we've seen such a drop in really 5, 10 -year part of the curve and even further out. And banks aren't really
buying; instead they're selling. And I guess I wa s wondering if you had thoughts on who's buying and what's driving the rates so much lower
than most people think they should be at.",2022,4
3,10,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, we do. But you should read – get the analyst reports to get that. We look at what everybody's doing: pension plans, governments. We
look at every part of the curve. We look what other banks are doing. I thin k I already mentioned earlier in this call, banks are in different
positions. Some may have to sell securities to pay off their loan books. We obviously don't. So, people are in a different po sition.
And as Jeremy pointed out, it's very important, that yi eld curve will not be the same six months from now as it is today. While we use that to
kind of look forward, it's not actually our forecast. We know it will be wrong. But the investment portfolio will be invested  when there are
opportunities. We bought a lot of Ginnie Maes when there was a 60 OAS spread.  We sold – one of the reasons we take securities losses is
because that gives you 10 -plus billion dollars you can reinvest at what you think are more attractive securities.",2022,4

0,11,Andrew Lim,Analyst,Société Générale,"Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the first one on credit quality, thanks for giving us commentary on the  shape of NCOs,
I guess, specifically for credit cards topping out at the end of this year. Could you give us a bit more color on how reserve b uilds should shape
out this year, I guess, with respect to CECL? I'm guessing they should top out quite soon. That's my first quest ion.",2022,4
1,11,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Fina ncial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Okay. Sure.,2022,4
2,11,Andrew Lim,Analyst,Société Générale,This is assuming all your macro assumptions are unchanged and so forth.,2022,4
3,11,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Andrew, well, I think we've talked about CECL quite a bit. And I think there's some decent color there in terms of Jami e's $6 billion over
a few quarters in a world where the economic outlook is worse than it is today. We're definitely not going to get into the business of giving you
an outlook for a sequential evolution of the loan loss allowance. It's appropriate today, and it will evolve as a function of  the environment.",2022,4
4,11,Andrew Lim,Analyst,Société Générale,"Sure. Okay. Let's drill down into NII then. I just want to square a few comments you made there, Jeremy. So, if I heard you correctly, I think
you are sort of talking about sequential increases in NII, so I guess looking towards like $20 billion plus for 1Q, maybe eve n 2Q. So, I guess
we're hitting about $40 billion for 1H and then a sharp drop -off as, say, deposit costs increase and maybe we get a few Fed Fund rate cuts as
well. Is that the way we should be thinking about it?",2022,4
5,11,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, no. So, let me uncontroversially say no there, Andrew, just for the avoidance of doubt. So, look, my comments about seq uential
increases were to address the sort of obvious conclusion, which you are somewhat correctl y drawing from the slide, which is that, in a world
where we're exiting the fourth quarter run rate at $81 billion, or $80 billion ex Markets or whatever, and we're telling you $74 billion for the full
year, there are obviously some sequential declines in there somewhere as a function of what plays out. We're simply saying don't project
those into the future in perpetuity. Once things adjust, we will return to normal sequential growth. Does that make sense?",2022,4
6,11,Andrew Lim,Analyst,Société Générale,"Right. Got you. Yeah. No, no, no, sure. Absolutely. That makes sense. That's great. Thanks for that.",2022,4
7,11,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yes. Thanks.,2022,4

0,1,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Hey, good morning.",2023,1
1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Good morning, Steve.",2023,1
2,1,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"So, Jamie, I was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with SVB impacting the regulatory
landscape for the big banks. In your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent  capital
requirements, the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks. But what are some of the changes that you're scenario
planning for – whether it's higher capital, increase in FDIC assessment fees? And along those same lines, how you're thinking about the
buyback given continued strong capital build, but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment.",2023,1
3,1,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, I think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there. Loo k, we're hoping that everyone just takes a deep
breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place. Obviously, when something happen s like this,
you should adjust, think about it. So I think down the road there may be some limitations on held -to-maturity, maybe more TLAC for certain
type-size banks, and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure, and stuff like that. But it doesn't have to be a revamp of the whole  system, just
recalibrating things the right way.
And I think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be. The outcome you should want is very strong community and reg ional
banks. And certain actions are taken which are drastic – it could actually make them weaker. So, that's all it is. We do expe ct higher capital
from Basel IV, effectively and, obviously there's going to be an FDIC assessment – that'll be what it is.",2023,1
4,1,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Got it. And just in terms of appetite for the buyback, just given some of the...",2023,1
5,1,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Oh, yeah.",2023,1
6,1,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,...elevated macro uncertainties.,2023,1
7,1,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, we've told you that we're kind of penciling in $12 billion for this year. Obviously, capital is more than that, but – and we did a little bit of
buyback this quarter. We're going to wait and see. We don't mind keeping our powder dry, and you've seen us do that with investment
portfolios, and we're also going to do that with capital.",2023,1
8,1,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,That's great. I'll hop back into the queue. Thanks so much for taking my questions.,2023,1
9,1,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Okay.,2023,1
0,2,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Hey, thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, I was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation
points that you made, just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep th at beta lower? And
maybe you can just  kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update? Thank you.",2023,1
1,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook. So the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid
expectations across both consumer and wholesale, which, as you mentioned, is driven by a couple factors. So, the change in th e rate
environment, with cuts coming sooner in the outlook, all else equal, does t ake some pressure off the reprice. And as you said, we're getting a
lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings. The short -term CD, in particular, is really getting a lot of positive feedback from
our folks in the branches. It's been v ery attractive to yield -seeking customers. So that's kind of working well. And then on the asset side, we
are seeing a little bit higher Card revolve, which is helping.
And I'll just remind you that at a conference in February, I suggested that we were al ready starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we
mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction, and that was one of the things that contribu ted to the
upward revision, like all of the uncertainty kind of went the s ame way. But as Jamie's pointed out – those uncertainties are all still there, we
highlight them on the page, and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the medium -term we remain very focused on those.",2023,1
2,2,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Yeah, and as a follow -up on the point about rate expectations coming now in, and potentially getting cut sooner – how do you take a look at
what that might mean just for the broader economy? Do you think it's more just because inflation's coming down? Do y ou think it's because
the Fed's just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there? Just kin d of your general
thinking about the other read -throughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broade r economy.",2023,1
3,2,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well first of all, I don't quite believe it. So the Fed has the rate curve, the forward short -term rate curve, almost at 1% higher than what the
market has. So one of the things you got to always prepare for is – it could be anything, we don't know what the rate curve is going to be in a
year. And so we're quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that. Obviously, the short -term read is higher recessionary risk and then
inflation coming dow n. So I think inflation will come down a little bit, but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore, the rat e
curve will have to go up a little bit.",2023,1
4,2,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,Okay. Thank you very much.,2023,1
0,3,John McDonald,Analyst,Auton omous Research,"Hi, thanks. Jeremy, wanted to follow up again on the drivers of the NII revision and the lower rates paid assumption. You men tioned the Fed
cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers. What about the March events? Do t he bank failures there that happened in
March – in your view, do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons? Or they intensify it indu stry-wide
because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits? How do thos e events influence your view of the reprice?",2023,1
1,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. John, it's a really good question, and we've obviously thought about that. But as we sit here today, I guess I have two  answers to that.
One is it's not meaningfully affecting our current outlook – we don't see it as  a major driver. And I think in terms of the larger dynamics that you
lay out, it's just a little too early to tell. But from where we are right now, the base case is no real impact.",2023,1
2,3,John McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Okay. And then I wanted to ask Jamie – there's a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch – banks are going to stop
lending, even Jay Powell mentioned that as a risk. Do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending and i s that a reaction
that makes sense – that banks might be retrenching a lot here? Do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch? Thanks.",2023,1
3,3,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I wouldn't use the word credit crunch if I were you. Obviously, there's going to be a little bit of tightening, and most of that will be around
certain real estate things. And you've heard it from real estate investors already, so I just look at that as a kind of thumb  on the scale. It just
makes the Fed's conditions be a little bit tighter , it increases the odds of a recession – that's what that is. It's not like a credit crunch.",2023,1
0,4,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS S ecurities LLC,"Hi. Good morning. My first question is you mentioned that your reserve build was driven mostly by worse economic assumptions.  I'm
wondering if you could update us on what unemployment rate you're assuming in your reserve.",2023,1
1,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, Erika, as you know, we take – not going to go into a lot of detail here – but we take the outlook from our economists, we run a
bunch of different scenarios and we probability -weight those. The central case outlook from ou r research team hasn't actually changed, but we
felt that in line with what Jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the events of March, it mad e sense to add a little bit of
weight to our relative adverse case. So we did that,  which changed the weighted -average expectation. And I think that the weighted -average
peak unemployment that we're using now is something like 5.8%.",2023,1
2,4,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"So, as you think about all of what you've just told us – so $81 billion of NII this year, and who knows when medium -term is going to happen of
mid-70s, the clear strength of the franchise producing 23% ROTCE in a quarter where your CET1 is 13.8% and a reserve that already  reflects
5.8% unemployment. As we think about recession and what JP Morgan can earn in a recession, do you think you can hit 17% ROTCE even in
2024 – assuming we do have a recession in 2024 as everybody is expecting – given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on
the reserve?",2023,1
3,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean that's an interesting question, Erika. I guess I'll say a couple things.",2023,1
4,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"It's a great question, so I want to see how Jeremy answers it.",2023,1
5,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Okay. Let's take a crack. Let's see what the boss thinks. I think number one, we believe, have said, and continue to believe that this is
fundamentally a 17% through the cycle ROTCE franchise, so number one. Number two, as Jamie always says, we run this company f or all
different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenari os.
On the particular question of ROTCE expectations in 2024 contingent on the particular economic outlook, obviously it depends a lot on the
nature of the recession. I think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession, but we' re a bank. A very serious
recession is of course going to be a headwind for returns, but we think even in a fairly severe recession, we'll deliver very  good returns –
whether that's 17% or not is too much detail for now.",2023,1
6,4,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,Thank you.,2023,1
0,5,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just a little bit on the deposit, your thought process there. You've seen some inflows. Why do you t hink that you
lose them going forward? And just maybe talk a little bit about the dynamic in pricing – do you feel like given the inflows, do you see some
pricing power for the larger banks?",2023,1
1,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. A couple things there. So, first of all, we don't know. Right? The deposits just came in. We don't know. We're guessing. Number two, the
deposits just came in. So, by definition, these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us, so it's prudent  and appropriate for
us to assume that  they won't be particularly stable. Number three, there's a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds so
you have to overlay that and that's embedded in our assumptions. And number four, it's a competitive market, and it's entirel y possible that
people temporarily come to us and then over time decide to go elsewhere. So, for all of those reasons, we're just being reali stic about the
stickiness of it.",2023,1
2,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"If I add, I would say, categorically, there's no pricing power that the bigger banks have because if you look at the pricing – and we look at
pricing sheets all the time – every bank is in a slightly different position and every bank is competing in three -month, six -month, nine -month
savings rates. And then you have the online banks, you got treasury bills, you got money market funds. There's no pricing pow er for the bank,
but obviously we all have different franchises and we're all in a slightly different position.",2023,1
3,5,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport  Global Securities LLC,"No, fair – all fair points. And maybe just a follow -up on John's question on the lending environment. You talked about the industry likely pulling
back. Are you changing your underwriting standards in any way? Just trying to think  through is there potential for some market share gains
given your strength of capital and liquidity? Or how you're thinking about the loan environment?",2023,1
4,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I'd say very modestly, but we look at that all the time.",2023,1
5,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle. And I think notably, we didn't loosen our underwriting standards when all the
numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic, and we're not going to overreact now and tighten unreasonably. Some of that co rrection
happens naturally – credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers whether in consumer or wh olesale, and that might make them leave our pre -
existing risk appetite, but we're not running around aggressively tightening standards right now.",2023,1
6,5,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,Okay. Great. Thanks.,2023,1
0,6,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Thank you. Hi, Jeremy.",2023,1
1,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hey, Gerard.",2023,1
2,6,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC C apital Markets LLC,"In your comments about your CET1 ratio, obviously it came in strong at 13.8%. You've got the GSIB buffer obviously going up n ext year, and
we have the stress test coming this summer or in June – the results – which maybe will lead to banks, including yours, having a higher Stress
Capital Buffer. Where should we think about that CET1 ratio being by the end of the year, do you think?",2023,1
3,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So a few things on there, Gerard. So we have previously said that we were targeting 13.5% in the first quarter of 2024 as a function of
assuming an unchanged SCB, the increased GSIB step and operating with a 50 -basis -point buffer. So, the point that Jamie made a second
ago, in light of the environment, Basel IV, dry  powder, you know, who knows how we'll tweak that going forward. But that's still our base case
assumption.
Specifically on the stress test, contrary to what I've heard some people argue, our ability to predict the SCB ahead of time from running our
own p rocess is actually quite limited. And you'll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase, we were off by a lmost a
factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being, and that was a big surprise for the whole industry. So, we want to be quite humble about
our ability to predict the SCB.
But having said that, for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged. There are some tailwinds in there through the OCI, but we believe
there will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in t he number, so for planning purposes right now we're assuming flat for SCB, and
we'll know soon enough what that actual number is.",2023,1
4,6,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Sure. And then just as a follow -up, if I heard you correctly, can you give us a little more color – I think you mentioned in building the loan loss
reserve this quarter you identified some one -off credits? I don't know if that's how you said it – there's some larger credits. Were they
commercial real estate oriented? Were they commercial? Any more color th ere?",2023,1
5,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Fina ncial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"No, it wasn't commercial real estate. It was just a couple of single name items in the Corporate segment.",2023,1
6,6,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC C apital Markets LLC,Leverage loan -type items or just regular Corporate credits?,2023,1
7,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Regular Corporate credits. I'd rather not get into too much detail...,2023,1
8,6,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Okay, very good.",2023,1
9,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,…Gerard. Sorry. Thanks.,2023,1
10,6,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC C apital Markets LLC,Thank you.,2023,1
0,7,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Hi, good morning. I guess, maybe one question, Jeremy. You reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for JPM. But, ob viously, you're
big players in the CRE market. Just give us a sense of when you look at t he two pressure points on CRE, one, how much is oversupply – and
that probably goes beyond office into apartments – how much of a issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years
going into a weakening economy? And how much of a risk is higher for longer rates in that if the central banks can't cut rates in the next year
or two, we will see a ton of more pain because of the re -fi wall that's coming up?",2023,1
1,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, so Ebrahim let me sort of respond narrowly i n connection with our portfolio and our exposure, right? So, really, the large majority of our
commercial real estate exposure is multi -family lending in supply constrained markets. And I think it's quite important to recognize the
difference between that and sort of higher end, higher price point, non -rent controlled, not supply constrained markets. So, our space is really
quite different in that respect, and I think that's a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long.
So, of cour se, we watch it very carefully and we don't assume that past performance predicts future results here, but I think our multi -family
lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things.",2023,1
2,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Can I just add also, housing is in short supply in America. It's not massively oversupplied like you saw in 2008.",2023,1
3,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And then in terms of the office space, as you know, o ur exposure is quite small. Yes, Jamie, has also mentioned all the re -fi dynamics
that you mentioned too are something that the office space is processing one way or the other. Our office exposure is quite m odest, very
concentrated in Class A buildings in sort of dense urban locations where the return to the office narrative is one of the drivers – is generally in
favor of high occupancy. So, again, watching it. There are obviously specific things here and there to pay attention to, but in the scheme of
things for us, not a big issue.",2023,1
4,7,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"And just as a follow up, I think the other risk from higher for longer rates, I think, is this – the ability of the economy, the financial markets to
sustain a 5% less Fed fund for a long period of time? Like, what are the other areas you're watching if du ration mismatch and bank balance
Ebrahim H. Poonawala
Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch  Q
sheets being one, CRE market being one, are you worrying – worried about non -banks that have grown exponentially over the last decade in
terms of risks at the non -banks if rates don't get cut? And if you can talk to the transmission mechanism of that coming back and hitting banks
given the leverage that banks provide to the non -banks.",2023,1
5,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, so I'd like to answer tha t. So there is a risk of higher rates for longer. And don't just think of just the Fed Funds rate, because I think you
should – for our planning – I'd be thinking more about it could be 6%. And then think about the five - and ten -year rate which could be 5% , and
I think if those things happen – I'm not saying they're going to happen – I just think people should prepare for them, they saw what just
happened when rates went up beyond people's expectations. You had the gilt problem in London, you had some of th e banks here. People
need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer.
If and when that happens, it will undress problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates, for those who are too
exposed to re -fi risk. Those ex posures will be in multiple parts of the economy. I say to all of our clients – now would be the time to fix it. Do
not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company, your business, your investment pools, et cetera . That's answer
number one.
Number two is, it will not come back to JPMorgan. Okay? While we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks, it is very – we think – it's
very, very secure. That does not mean it won't come back to other credit providers.",2023,1
6,7,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.,2023,1
0,8,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo  Securities LLC,"Hey Jeremy, you mentioned a degree of reintermediation to the lending markets. You said capital markets activity has gone to bank lending,
and I'm just wondering, as part of your $7 billion increased NII guide, are you assuming better lo an spreads? And on the topic of loan pricing,
why aren't your credit card yields going higher than where they are today? Thanks.",2023,1
1,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Mike. So I think, yeah, you're referring to my comments that I made in the Commercial Bank about the fact that the larger Corporate
segment within the Commercial Bank that would generally have access to capital markets but also access to bank lending, at th e margin is
choosing to draw down revolvers right now rather than access t he capital markets. That is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase
in NII guidance. There's a lot of odds and ends in there, but the major drivers are the ones that I called out.
And to be honest, I haven't actually specifically checked what 's happening with Card yields. I would imagine that they've gone up a little bit in
line with rates, but I don't know. We should follow up here.",2023,1
2,8,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"All right. And then one for you, Jamie. I guess taking the 10,000 foot level, I guess, when  you look at asset liability management, or ALM – you
could call this nightmare on ALM street, and you've seen some big problems at banks, and I guess how would you evaluate yours elf, I guess,
with this $7 billion higher NII guide? It probably is good, but  to what degree are you willing to sacrifice JPM shareholder money to help rescue
problem banks that did not get their asset liability management correctly?",2023,1
3,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, it's two really different questions. So we've been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while, and how we invest our portfolio, what
our expectations are, our stress testing. The stress test – the CCAR stress test, as you know, had rates going down. I always looked at rates
going up and being prepared – whether or not anything is going to happen. So we've been quite conservative ourselves and we don't mind
continuing to do that because I remind people that having excess capital, you haven't lost it. It's kind of earnings in store  – you get to d eploy it
later and maybe at a more opportune time, when the time comes.
And look, we like to help the system when it needs help, if we can reasonably. And we're not the only ones, you saw a lot of banks do that,
and I was proud of them. I think all of us did the right thing. Whether ultimately it works out or not, well, you could second -guess that when it
happens. But the fact is, I think people want to help the system. And this whole banking thing was bad for banks. And I knew that the second I
saw the he adline, and then you had Credit Suisse. We want healthy community banks. We want healthy regional banks. We want to help them
get through this.
We have, you'll remember, Mike, as you point out, we have the best financial system the world's ever seen. That  does not mean it won't have
problems, doesn't mean there shouldn't be changes made, but I think it's reasonable for people to help each other in times of  need. And we all
did that – all of us – did that during COVID. All of us did that – if you could, tho se who could – did it during the Great Financial Crisis, and I
would expect people to do that going forward.",2023,1
4,8,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Farg o Securities LLC,"Hey Jamie, your CEO letter said the banking crisis isn't over. So, what do you mean by that? Or was that dated two weeks late r? Are you
talking contagion or what?",2023,1
5,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So it's just – the number of banks offsides you can count on your hands, in terms of too much interest rate exposure, too much ATM,
too much uninsured deposits. And so there may be additional bank failures, something like that, which we don't know. But you' re going to see
next week regional banks have pretty good numbers. A lot of people are going to have – can take – actions to remediate some of the issues
they may have going forward.
You've already seen things calm down quite a bit, particularly in deposit flows. Warren Bu ffett was on TV talking about that he would bet $1
million – I don't know if you saw that – that no depositor will lose money in America. That he's willing to bet his own money. And of course, you
know he's a very bright man. So, this crisis is not 2008. I t will pass. And the one thing I pointed out is, when I answered the question just
before about interest rates – people need to be prepared. They shouldn't pray that they don't go up. They should prepare for them going up.
And if it doesn't happen, serendi pity.",2023,1

0,9,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Mor gan Stanley & Co. LLC,Hi. Good morning.,2023,1
1,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hey, Betsy.",2023,1
2,9,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,I do want to unpack the question here on the possibility of higher for longer rates and how that impacts you in your non -Markets NII...,2023,1
3,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Betsy, did we just lose you? I feel like you just dropped.",2023,1
4,9,Betsy L. Grasec k,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"No, hear me? Hello?",2023,1
5,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Go ahead.,2023,1
6,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah. You're back now.,2023,1
7,9,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Okay. So I just wanted to unpack the higher for longer rate possibility as to how it impacts your NII because your NII guide is assuming the
forward curve, if I understand co rrectly. So, in the event that you get that higher for longer, just how much does that impact NII ex. Markets
because I'm trying to triangulate here about – maybe you lose some deposits, but if we have higher for longer, shouldn't we expect the
trajectory goes up from this quarter as opposed to down? Is that – that's the question.",2023,1
8,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Go ahead, Jeremy. And then I'll go.",2023,1
9,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. So, Betsy, your question is very good. And I would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year, it w as pretty clear that we
were very asset -sensitive, certainly in terms of the sort of one  year forward EaR type measure. You also obviously know that our current EaR
actually shows a slight negative number, so a tiny bit liability sensitive, and I won't get into all the nuances about why th at may or may not be a
great predictor in the short -term. But the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year. And at this
level of rates, the relationship between our short -term NII evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment.
It's quite tricky, and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of, again, what I've alluded to a couple times on th is call – the
competitive environment for deposits, which is not, in fact, a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function  of the rate curve. So, that's
why we're emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the NII outlook. Yeah.",2023,1
10,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So I'll just add, so next quarter we all kind of know already. Two quarters out, we know a little bit less. Three quart ers out, we know a
little bit less. And 2024, we know very little. That number, you could imagine – this is a little inside basebal l now – the number that we're
talking about for 2024 is not based upon an implied curve. It's based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios, leveli ng them kind of out
and saying this is kind of a range.
And you're absolutely correct. You could ha ve an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that, but remember, higher for
longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it – like maybe a recession, stagflation, lower volumes. So I wouldn't look at that as higher
for longer is a positive. It might be a slight positive on that line. It would probably would be a negative on other lines.",2023,1
11,9,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Yeah. Got it. Okay, that's super helpful to understand how you think through that. And then the follow -up is just on the buybacks. So do I take
your comments to mean that you're on pause now? And if that's the case, what would be the driver of restarting?",2023,1
12,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. No. We're not on pause now. We're doing a little bit now. We obviously have a lot of excess capital. We also like to buy our stock when
it's cheap, not just when it's available. And we're also peering ahead, looking at those little bit of storm clouds so we're going to be kind of
cautious. So we're going to make thi s decision every day. We also don't like to tell the market what we're doing, just so you know.",2023,1
13,9,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Yeah. And then can you give us any sense of what Basel IV endgame means to you in your RWAs? How much should we be baking in for
those?",2023,1
14,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Betsy, we really don't have any new information there, right? I mean, I think clearly if you go back like a year, we we re maybe a little bit
more optimistic that it might be across all the different levers a nd all the different pieces of it, closer to capital neutral. I think now it feels like
it’s likely to be worse than that. Hopefully, it’s not too much worse than that. And I would just remind you that there are a  lot of different levers,
so when the NPR c omes, that's only going to be a part of it, there's going to be other pieces – the holistic review. And it's going to take a lot of
time to phase in and we're going to have time to adjust. So we'll know when we know.",2023,1
15,9,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,Got it.,2023,1
16,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Execut ive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And there were supposed – I just remembered, there were supposed to be pauses in there about how they looked at banks relative to the
global economy, which are getting smaller. The G -SIFI was supposed to be adjusted for  that. So, it may very – we're expecting it go up, but
there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn't go up. And JPMorgan – there's so much capital. I mean, so you can't look at JPMorgan and say,
well, it's a capital issue. And even the banks, by the way, whe n you look at it – even though some of the banks that are in trouble, they have
plenty of capital. Their issue wasn't capital, it was other things. And so I'm just hoping regulators are very thoughtful.
And the other thing is they should a priori decide what they want out of the banking system at this point because I've made it clear – I can look
at the banking system and say that no bank should keep a loan, if possible. That's how much capital is now being required for  loans.",2023,1
17,9,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,This is based on the current rule set.,2023,1
18,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, because the market is pricing holds. The market would take loans at much lower capital ratio than banks are being force d to hold for
them. I'm talking about just lo ans only. So that's why you're seeing a lot of capital go to – I mean a lot of credit go to non -banks, and
dramatically, by the way. Rapidly and dramatically. And so if you're a regulator, you should be looking at it and saying, do I want that? Is that a
good thing for the system? If you believe it's a good thing for the system, raise the capital and more credit will go out of t he system. That's fine.
If that's what they want, that's fine. But they should do it with a forethought, not accidentally.
........",2023,1
19,9,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"I like the NII from loans better than the gain on sale, so I'll prefer the former not the latter. But thanks, appreciate it.",2023,1
20,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yes.,2023,1
0,10,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Thank you. So you talked about in your letter about regulators avoiding the knee -jerk reaction, which you addressed earlier. I'm curious on
your thoughts around how customers have reacted and should react. Now my point, my question is – consumers can move excess cash
balances if they want more insurance. They can do that in a lot of different ways: move it, treasuries, money market, extra a ccounts, whatever.
The issue, the question I have for you is on the corporate side. Have you seen big c hanges in how corporate treasurers or CFOs are adapting
their cash balances and working capital – and should they need to? And I appreciate your Warren Buffett comments.",2023,1
1,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Glenn, in short, we really haven't seen big ch anges to speak of. And I do think it's just worth saying – I think you're sort of hinting at this
a little bit when you talk about the behavior of corporates – that when we talk about responses to the recent events through the lens of
uninsured deposits, t hat's obviously very different if you're talking about large balances of non -operating uninsured deposits from financial
institutions or de facto financial institutions versus normal large corporate operating balances, which is, of course, like c ore bankin g business
for all of us.",2023,1
2,10,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"When we saw it in Commercial Banking, Payments, Investment Banking and Custody, you did see money move – or I would call excess cash
was moved out. But they have options. What I would call more like operational cash –  so think even of a small companies, middle market
companies, et cetera – that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there, you have your money there, you're getting more and
more competitive in rates . And that's why I think you see lot of regional banks – they've got sticky middle market deposits.
If I lent you $30 million and you have $10 million, you're probably going to leave it at my bank. And they also are more comp etitive on the rate
for that. So, I think you shouldn't be looking at deposit like one class – there's a whole bunch of different types, and analytically you go through
each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is, and what the stickiness is and et cetera and so on. But I thin k they have already – as the
Fed has raised rates, you've already seen – that's the reason we expected outflows both from consumers and corporate customers.",2023,1
3,10,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Interesting. Just follow -up, the other thing that caught my eye in the letter is you mentioned that you're exploring new capital optimization
strategies including partnerships and securitizations. What's different than what you've already been doing for the last 30 y ears?",2023,1
4,10,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"We've got our smartest pe ople, we’re going to figure out every angle to reduce capital requirements for JPMorgan. That's the difference. And
we've been doing it, but there's securitizations, there are partnerships. You're seeing a lot of the private equity do the li fe insurance
companies, and I expect that we're going to come up with a whole bunch of different things over time. And we'll shed certain as sets, too.",2023,1

0,11,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Good morning. You guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely hig her credit card
balances. And I was just wondering if you could flush out what changed there on the outlook today versus three months ago. An d I guess, is it
a good or bad thing that those balances will be higher than you thought?",2023,1
1,11,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. S o the story there is kind of the same story we've been talking about for a while. It's just a matter of degree. So we had rev olving
balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar ter ms to the same
level as we'd had pre -pandemic, which I think happened last quarter. And then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the
revolve per -account, because we also have seen some account growth, and that continues to happen. And so also, to Mike's question earlier,
we're seeing a higher yield there as well.
So, and on your question of whether it's good or bad, obviously there's a point at which the consumers have too much leverage . We don't see
that yet, so.",2023,1

kind of broader, overarching…",2023,1

0,1,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jeremy, you talked about NII guidance up. Clearly, Fed Funds futures are up so it makes some sense. But
maybe I guess first, could you kind of discuss – I guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what you're seeing
there so far? It seems to be coming in a little better than expected. And th en secondly, and probably more importantly, can you help us think
about the implications of higher -for-longer rates on the outlook for NII next year and beyond? I guess the intermediate term outlook that you
guys had talked about?",2023,2
1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Fin ancial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. Thanks, Jim. So, yeah, so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision, as I said, it's higher rates cou pled with lower
deposit reprice; hard to untangle the two drivers. And specifically, I think when you look at Consumer, the combination of the passage of time
and the positive feedback we're getting from the field and the CD offerings in particular has meant that it's quite a kind of  stable environment
from that perspective. And similarly, in Wholesale we're just seeing slower internal migrations. You asked about mix. I think that obviously,
we're seeing the CD mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate c ycle into ne xt
year as we continue to capture money in motion. But as you say, the most important point is the fact that, as I said earlier,  we don't consider
this level of NII generation to be sustainable.
And we talked previously about a sort of medium -term run rat e in the mid -70s. That was before First Republic, and you could argue that
maybe that number should be a little higher. But whatever it is, it's a lot lower than the current number. We don't know when  that's going to
happen. We're not going to predict the exact moment; that's going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace. But we want to
be clear that we do expect it at some point.",2023,2
2,1,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Okay. But I guess just one follow -up on that. Just if we don't get rate cuts till middle of next year or later, does that sort of give some
confidence to the outlook for next year or are you still worried about significant reprice?",2023,2
3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I wou ldn't necessarily assume that the evolution from the current run rate into that mid -70s number is that sensitive to the rate outlook in
particular. When we put that number out there, we looked at a range of different types of rate environments and the repr ice that we think would
be associated with that. It was really meant to capture more of what we consider to be a through -the-cycle sustainable number, so I wouldn't
think of it as being particularly rate -dependent.",2023,2
4,1,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,Okay. Great. Thanks.,2023,2
0,2,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I'm just laughing to myself because I said to you at Investor Day – do you have any more NII rabbits to pull out of
the hat, and I guess you do. So I guess, I want to ask a broader question really here. And maybe, Jamie, I'd like to get your  thoughts. So you
earned 23% ROTCE on 13.8% CET1, and we hear you  loud and clear that you're more normalized NII generation is not $87 billion. That being
said, and fully taking into account the potential haircut from Basel III Endgame, is it possible that your natural ROTCE is m aybe above that
17% through -the-cycle rat e when rates aren't zero? Because when you first introduced that ROTCE target, we were in a different world from a
rate scenario and everybody's talking about even if the Fed cuts, the natural sort of bottom in Fed funds is not going to be zero. So any inp ut
on that would be great.",2023,2
1,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks, Erika. I mean, it's a good question. There's a lot in there, obviously. I guess I would start by saying that wh en we talked about
the 17% through -the-cycle ROTCE, even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound, it was
always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment, and at some level that remains true today. Furthermore, you didn't ask this
explicitly, but in the context of the proposed Basel III Endgame, one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the
denominator, what happens to that target? So I think as I said in my prepared remarks, we feel very confident about the compa ny's abi lity to
produce excellent returns through the cycle. There's a lot of moving parts right now in that; some of them could be good, som e of them could
be bad.
Narrowly, on the capital one, the one thing to point out is that the straight -up math of simply di luting down the ROTCE by expanding the
denominator misses the possibility of reprice, repricing of products and services, which of course goes back to our point tha t these capital
increases do have impacts on the real economy. So we're not suggesting that we can price our way out of it, but we obviously need to get the
right returns on products and services, and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital. So a lot of mov ing parts in there,
but I think the important point is that throug h a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results. And we'll see how the
mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the Basel III proposal and then go through the comment perio d.",2023,2
2,2,Jamie Dimon,"Ch ief Executive Officer, Chairman",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And Erika, I would just add one thing. We do have a mix of businesses that earn from like 0% ROTCE to 100%. We have some whic h are very
capital -intensive so we look at kind of all of them, and I think 17% is a good number and a good target. The other thing we're over -earning on
is credit. We've been over -earning on credit for a substantial amount of time now, we're quite conscious about it. We know that it's going to
pick up just as it normalizes, considerably  more than now. Look, we would consider credit card normalizing to be closer to 3.5%.",2023,2
3,2,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS S ecurities LLC,"And so my follow -up question there. Maybe, Jeremy, could you remind us what unemployment rate is embedded in your ACL ratio as of the
second quarter?",2023,2
4,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah. It’s still 5.8% .,2023,2
5,2,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,Thank you.,2023,2
0,3,John McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, wanted to ask about capital in the wake of the Barr speech. We don't have the details yet, but just  kind of wanted
to ask about options that you have and strategies for mitigation both on RWA and p otentially on the GSIB front as well as you contemplate
what you heard recently.",2023,2
1,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks, John. So obviously, we're thinking about that a lot. On the other hand, as much as there have been a lot of ver y detailed
rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning, it does seem like this time it's real and we are ac tually going to get a
proposal presumably sometime this month or something. So soon enough, we'll get to see something act ually on paper and we can stop kind
of the guesswork. Having said that, indulging in a little bit of guesswork, it does seem like the biggest single driver of th e increase that people
are talking about, including Chair Powell's 20% number or Vice Chair Bar r’s 2% of RWA which winds up being roughly the same, is just the
way operational risk is getting introduced into the Standardized pillar. And that is a little bit of a straight -up, across -the-board tax on everything.
It's kind of hard to optimize your way out of that, with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price, assuming you
have pricing power, but that's obviously not what we want and that's what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy. So there are
details, there  is a lot of the FRTB stuff; we can get way into the weeds there within the Markets business. And we do have a good track reco rd
of adjusting and optimizing, but this time around, it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as oppos ed to the ability
to sort of optimize in a very technical way .",2023,2
2,3,John McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Okay. That's helpful. And with a number of years for this to phase in and you generating capital at a high level even if the ROTCE comes
down a bit, how should we think about you r pace of building capital for these new changes versus doing your everyday course of investing and
buybacks and things like that over the next couple years?",2023,2
3,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, I guess I'm sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here. I mean, we're not going to sacrifice investments,
right? That won't come as a surprise to you. Generally speaking, we're always going to try to comply with new requirements ea rly. So when we
know the requirements and when w e have visibility, obviously given how much organic capital we're generating right now, whatever the
answer winds up being it'll be pretty easy to comply, narrowly speaking. But that's not the same as saying that there won't b e consequences to
returns or t o pricing. And if for whatever reason things aren't exactly as we're anticipating, I don't see us sacrificing investments tha t we see as
strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever.",2023,2
4,3,John McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous  Research,Okay. And there's some room for buybacks?,2023,2
5,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"It's unlikely, obviously. That would be an unlikely outcome.",2023,2
6,3,John McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,Okay. Thank you.,2023,2
7,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financia l Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sorry, John. Go ahead. Did you have a follow -up?",2023,2
8,3,John McDonald,Analyst,Autono mous Research,"Yeah. No, just do buybacks play a role in the next couple years strategically? Do you episodically buy back?",2023,2
9,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I mean, capital hierarchy again, right? In the end, when we have nothing else to do with the money, we'll do buybacks. And we  talked about
the $12 billion for this year. Obviously a lot of new moving parts there. Although all else equal, given what we've done so far, that's still
probably a reasonable number for the full year. But, yeah, that's always going to be at the end of the list. But, yeah.",2023,2
10,3,John McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,Got it. Okay. Thank you.,2023,2
0,4,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a little bit about how you're feeling about the trade -off between like the commercial economy and
what might come through in terms of future loan growt h versus the kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the Investment
Banking pipeline and just how it feels in terms of like re -opening of markets and the trade -off between getting some more of those fees in
versus what's happening on the loan  demand side. Thanks.",2023,2
1,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Good question, Ken. So I think in terms of Investment Banking and Markets, yeah, slightly better than expected last mon th. What I would
talk about green shoots especially in Capital Markets generally, still definitely some headwinds in M&A, lower announced activity, some
regulatory headwinds there, so we'll see. I think it's a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results, but we'll see. In terms of the
broader econom y and loan growth expectations, generally, we do still expect reasonably robust Card loan growth. But away from that for a
variety of different reasons and different products, whether it be mortgage or C&I after revolver normalization, and especial ly if we  see a little
bit of a cooling off of the economy, I would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there, so we're not really expecting meaningful growth
away from Card.
But of course, we're there for the right deals, right products, right terms. We lend through the cycle, so I see that as more of a demand -driven
narrative which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side.",2023,2
2,4,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,"That makes sense. And as a follow -up to that, on the Consumer side you mentioned that consumer s continue to spend albeit a little more
slowly, and you mentioned that consumers are also using their excess deposits a little bit more as well. Can you just elabora te a little bit more
on just your feeling about the state of the consumer? And is that Car d growth continue to be driven by people needing to revolve as opposed
to wanting to have more in their deposits? Just kind of want the trade -off on that side too?",2023,2
3,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, to us I think we still see this as a normalization, not deterioration story when we talk about consumer credit. Actually, revolve
per account has still not gotten to pre -pandemic levels actually, so I would definitely say that it's a wanting rather than needing at least for our
portfolio at t his point. And, yeah, I think the consumer continues to surprise on the upside here.",2023,2
4,4,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,Got it. Okay. Thank you.,2023,2
0,5,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Good morning, Jeremy. Good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, can you give us your view on how you're measuring the treasury functions a nd the
asset liability of your balance sheet as we go forward versus the way you guys were positioning and managing it a year ago in  view of the fact
that it looks like maybe we're approaching the terminal rate on Fed funds rates?",2023,2
1,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Gerard, I would say honestly not much changed there actually. We have been pretty consistently concerned about the risk  of higher
rates. Of course, we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenario s. But at the margin, we've
been biased towards higher rates, and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before, although a lot of th at is just the
consequence of deposit convexity playing out in the modeling. But in any case, all else equal, I think we are going to continue to focus on
making sure we're fine in a higher rate scenario while staying balanced across a range of scenarios. So not really a lot of c hange in our
positioning, and that's obviously including the fact that we took on First Republic which, even net of some of the liabilities, had a long structural
interest rate position. We did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal, and so as a result we took actions to ens ure that net -net we
are still about the same as  we were last quarter.",2023,2
2,5,Gerard  Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Very good. And then as a follow -up, you mentioned in giving us the read -through on the Commercial Banking segment of the business that
you had some reserve building tied to some office real estate and also some downgrades in the Middle Market area. Can you go a little
deeper? What are you guys seeing in this area, both Commercial Real Estate but also the C&I loans? What's happening in that s egment as
well?",2023,2
3,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So I would caution you from drawing too broad a conclusion from this. I mean, I think that when we talk about office for example, our
portfolio as you know is quite small and our exposure to sort of so -called urban dense office is even smaller. The vast majorit y of our overall
portfolio is multi -family lending so as a result, like our sample size of observed valuations on office properties is quite small. But you know we
like to be sort of ahead of the cycle, and based on everything that we saw this quarter it j ust felt reasonable to build a little bit there to get to
what felt like a comfortable coverage ratio. In the Middle Market segment, we saw downgrades in excess of upgrades, but I don 't see that as
sort of necessarily indicative of anything terribly signif icant in the broader read -across.",2023,2
4,5,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,Thank you .,2023,2
0,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Steve, you there?",2023,2
0,7,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Good morning. I guess just first question, following up on the outlook for the economy. Like, we've all been worried about the recession for a
year and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about – Jeremy, I think you mentioned your
unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried shou ld we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months
from now? Or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot bett er than we
expected a year ago?",2023,2
1,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, I  mean, I'm sure Jamie has some views here. But in my view, I would just caution against jumping to too many super -positive
conclusions based on a couple of recent prints. And I think generally, our point is less about trying to predict a particular  outcome  and more
about trying to make sure that we don't get too much euphoria that over -concentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that
there's a range of outcomes out there. So obviously, people are talking a lot about the potential for soft -landing right now, no landing,
immaculate disinflation or whatever. And whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully, I don't know. But the broad er point is that
we continue to be quite focused on Jamie's prior comment that loss rates still have  room to normalize even post -pandemic, so we're probably
over-earning on credit a little bit.
Obviously, we've talked about the expectation that the NII is going to come down quite a bit. So even forgetting about whethe r you get some
surprisingly negative  outcomes on the economy from where we stand today, even in a central case you just need to recognize that there
should be some significant normalization.",2023,2
2,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And I would just add that the 5.8% is not our predic tion. That is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have
to use which are hypothetical for CECL. So you have this prediction that's going to always look something different and we do n't know the
outcome. We try to be really clear  here – the consumer is in good shape, they're spending down their excess cash – that's all tailwinds. Even if
we go to a recession, they're going with rather good conditions, low borrowings and good house price values still. But the he adwinds are
substant ial and somewhat unprecedented. There's war in Ukraine, oil and gas, quantitative tightening, unprecedented fiscal needs of
governments, QT which we never experienced before. I just think people should take a deep breath on that. We don't know if th ose thi ngs
could put us in a soft landing, a mild recession or a hard recession. And obviously, we all hope for the best.",2023,2
3,7,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Got it. And just a follow -up on the upcoming Basel reforms, two questions. You've talked about the impact to the U.S. economy, like others
have said the same. At this point, is that falling on deaf ears? And secondly, maybe, Jeremy, if you can touch upon just structural changes that
you expect to make in the Capital Markets business because of FRTB. Thank you.",2023,2
4,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So on your first point, I mean, I think you can just read Vic e Chair Barr's speech, right?",2023,2
5,7,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,Yeah .,2023,2
6,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"He addressed that point fairly directly. He clearly doesn't agree as is his right, so we'll see what happens. We continue to feel that, all else
equal, higher capital requirements de finitely are going to increase the cost of credit, which is bad for the economy, so we'll see what happens
on that. On FRTB, it's really very nuanced. It's probably too much detail for this call, to be honest. But just to give you l ike one immaterial and
insignificant but useful example, one product under FRTB is yield curve spread options. And if the FRTB proposal goes through as currently
written, that product just becomes not viable. So, obviously, if we need to stop doing that product, no one really car es. But it's just one
example of the way sometimes, when you're really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly all the way down to individu al products and
responding accordingly, you can wind up having to change your business mix.
There are obviou sly more significant products that matter much more for the real economy like mortgage where the layering -on of the
operational risk and the way it's being proposed, especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal don't c ome through, yo u're
once again making that product even harder to offer to homeowners. So we'll see, we'll see what happens.",2023,2
7,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I would just add to that. Even if your product doesn't make money, you might do it for clients who are great clients. You're going to manage by
product, by client, and by effectively business mix, and those need a djustments. Roughly, loans don't make sense to put on your balance
sheet as a whole, almost any loan, and people have to recognize that. And so we just manage through all the various complicat ions here and
figure out what the hell to do.",2023,2
8,7,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America M errill Lynch,Okay. Thank you.,2023,2
0,8,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Hi. I had another question on Vice Chair Barr's speech from this week. To the extent that capital ratios do go up 20% for you  and perhaps
others, to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business, repricing or simply
removing activities that you used to do? It's kind of ironic, or maybe it's not ironic, that Apollo hits an all -time stock price high at the same week
of the speech. So how much business leaves JPMorgan or the industry if capital ratios do go up as much as potentially propose d?",2023,2
1,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Mike, I mean...",2023,2
2,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Wait. Before Jeremy answers the question, this is great news for hedge funds, private equity, private credit, Apollo, Blackst one – and they’re
dancing in the streets.",2023,2
3,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, exactly. And I was going to say, Mike, yes to everything, so meaning repricing, yes, definitely. To the extent that we have pricing power
and the higher capital requirements mean that we're not generating the right r eturns for shareholders, we will try to reprice and we'll see how
that sticks and how that flows into the economy and how that affects demand for products. And if the repricing is not success ful, then in some
cases we will have to remix and that means gett ing out of certain products and services. And as Jamie points out, that probably means that
those products and services leave the regulated perimeter and go elsewhere, and that's fine. As Jamie points out, those peopl e are clients
and I think that point wa s addressed also in Vice Chair Barr's speech. But traditionally, having risky activities leave the regulated perimeter has
had some negative consequences, so these are all important things to consider.",2023,2
4,8,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Alright, and separate question. I appreciate the Investor Day – gives a little bit more color on the degree that your investments may or may not
pan out; we are still all watching that closely. Having said that, you just increased revenue guidance by $10 billion for NII  between  this quarter
and the first quarter without changing expense guidance by even $1. Aren't you tempted to spend a little bit more? Why not sp end more if
you're gaining share? And I'm not saying that you should; I'm just wondering like aren't you tempted to d o so? You have $10 billion more
revenues and you're not spending $1 more of expenses. Like, why not?",2023,2
5,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Mike, let me get this right. You're actually complaining that our expenses aren't high enough? Is that right?",2023,2
6,8,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Wait, wait. Just to be clear. It's just the flip side of the question I asked for two years,  going back to it.",2023,2
7,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Fair enough. I appreciate the balance. In all seriousness, we've always been pretty clear, right, that our spending is throug h-the-cycle
spending based on through -the-cycle investment, through -the-cycle spending based on our through -the-cycle view of the earnings -generating
power of the company and the goal to produce the right returns. So broadly speaking, NII tends to flow straight through to th e bottom line, both
when it's  going up and, by the way, when it's going down too, and we've been through those moments as you well remember. So whether or
not there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that, we have actually looked at that r ecent ly. I don't see
that being a meaningful item this year, which is part of why we have not revised the expense guidance so far.
But this is about investing through the cycle and being honest and disciplined about which revenue items carry expense loadin g and which of
them don't.",2023,2
8,8,Mike M ayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,And then last quick follow -up...,2023,2
9,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Mike, I think we're kind of running as fast as we can. So if you actually sat down directly with credit compliance, auto mark et, bankers,
recruiters, traders – Mike, this is it. We're full effort right now and we want to make sure we get things right and get things thoughtful and
careful. So it's not just the money, it's the people and how many things you can change all at once and add to all at once.",2023,2
10,8,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"And then one quick follow -up to that. Your efficiency ratio this quarter is the lowest we've seen in a long, long time and I guess you're saying
don't extrapolate this efficiency ratio because NII will come down at s ome point. But when you just simply look at – you benchmark yourself
against the low -cost providers, where do you think you're there now and where can you still go because if you extrapolate this quarter, you'r e
getting closer?",2023,2
11,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, you said it yourself, right? You definitely can extrapolate the current numbers. But I think more broadly on be nchmarking
ourselves to low -cost providers, it sort of speaks to an area that you've been interested in for a long time which  is all of the investment that
we're doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed in terms  of how we
respond to volumes – that's a big part of the reason that we're doing the investments tha t we're doing, and modernization and cloud and AI
and all the type of stuff that we've talked about a lot. So I think we feel really good about our efficiency as a company, bu t there definitely is
room for improvement.",2023,2
12,8,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Farg o Securities LLC,Alright. Thank you.,2023,2
0,9,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Hey. Thanks for taking the question and apologies for the technical issues earlier. Wanted to ask on the deposit outlook – just with signs that
recent liquidity drawdown has come predominantly out of RRP versus industry deposits, just wanted to get your thoughts on what expectations
you have for deposit growth in the second half, both for you and even the broader industry, especially as Treasury issuance r eally begins to
ramp in earnest.",2023,2
1,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Good question, Steve, so let me say a couple things about this. So obviously, our deposit numbers have bounced around a  little bit as a
function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as wel l as obviously the First Republic transaction. But now, if you look at our
kind of end -of-period deposits this quarter and you project forward, our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend t o
re-assert itself from this higher start ing point, broadly as a function of QT playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for
offsets by taking share. Just to give a couple examples, like in Consumer, we've got some of our branch expansion markets sea soning and so
there are share opportunities there. And in Wholesale, we’ve obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have
compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates, and so there are potentially some share offsets there. But broadly, ou r core  view
remains modest deposit declines across the franchise.
Within that, you note the same thing we've noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the TGA build has come into effe ct, and you've
seen a lot of bill issuance, big question in the market  about whether that was going to come out of reserves or come out of RRP. And so far,
with most of the TGA build – I guess they're targeting $600 billion and they're at $550 billion – or something so they're almost done, more of it
than some people feared has come out of RRP. So as you say, I think that's a relatively good sign and highlights how the system works better
when you've got ample supply of short -dated collateral on the front end of the yield curve. So that whole RRP/TGA bank reserve dynamic is
going to continue to be significant, but it is good to see RRP coming down a little bit.",2023,2
2,9,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Helpful color, and just a follow -up on Card income. Revenues were muted in the quarter. I was hoping you could unpack just the sources of
pressure. Maybe more specifically, how much of a drag is associated with FAS 91 versus some other factors.",2023,2
3,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So actually, that Card income number, Steve, is a little bit of a one -off thing. So we had a reward liability  adjustment this quarter, kind of
a technical thing, so that's just a temporary headwind. And also, the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small p ositive one -off item
in the prior period. And obviously, I know you guys looked at it, but Card i ncome isn't sort of a thing we look at that much ourselves.",2023,2
4,9,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,Can you size the reward liability impact?,2023,2
5,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Why don't you get Mikael to give that to you? It's not that significant but it's enough to just make the sequential number lo ok a little bit wonky.,2023,2
6,9,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,Great . Thanks for taking my questions.,2023,2
0,10,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Thank you. Just want to follow -up on this pricing power conversation because you've been consistent over time that you have a limited ability
to sustain pricing power due to the competitive landscape. But I guess my question is if not now, when? Meaning, a lot has changed on the
institutional side, the European bank side, the regional bank side and I would think that there’d be certain businesses that you have a greater
ability an d willingness to push price on. And then maybe you could tie that to your comments in the press release on what are the mater ial –
what are the real -world consequences for markets and end users that you're referring to when talking about material regulator y changes?
Thanks a lot.",2023,2
1,10,Jere my Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. So, look, on pricing power, you're right – it really depends on the product and it depends on the competitive landscape across different
banks, and so it's very granular, it's very product -specific and in some cases we'll have more pricing power than in other cases. I think the
overall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel III Endgame is just that like we think the capital increases  are excessive and it
puts pressure on retu rns all else equal, that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can. That is generally a bad thing for the
real economy and how all that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen, importantly sinc e we d on't actually
have the proposal yet – so we need those details. And sorry, Glenn I forgot the second half of your question. What was it?",2023,2
2,10,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Actually, I think you hit on it so I'll just do a follow -up on a related. So the notion of private credit doing large traditional investment -grade
lending activity is maybe part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price. In Jamie's letter, you tal ked about the downside
– or my question is what's the downside if more of the mortg age credit asset -backed intermediation business is pushed out of the banking
system?",2023,2
3,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by downside. But I just think societally speaking, I think we've seen in recent history that when
home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad, when you have economic downturns, it produces b ad
outcomes for individuals and homeowners and society as a whole, and Jamie has written about this extensively. Beyond that, financially,
we've talked about how mortgage lending – I mean, the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical and the recent past has actually
been very profitable, then it was less so. Like, the correspondent channel right now is a ctually picking up a little bit. But it's a thin -margin
business, it's challenging. And when you increase the capital requirements, it makes it even harder so that just becomes one of the areas
where you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing p ower that we talked about a second ago.
And it might, in fact, mean that we do less – less credit available for homeowners and more regulatory risk as the activity moves outside the
perimeter.",2023,2

2,11,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Mor gan Stanley & Co. LLC,"I just wanted to unpack a little bit more the drivers of the change you outlined that's coming in the 10 -Q, Jeremy, regarding the asset sensitivity
going from liability -sensitive to asset -sensitive, at least that's the way I read i t. I just wanted to understand what the drivers of that is.",2023,2
3,11,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. No problem, Betsy. I mean, as you know, that's always been a challenging number. It's meant as a risk management measure of
sorts, although it's also somewhat limited in that respect, and it has been of uneven usefulness in terms of a tool to be able to predict our NII
trajectory when rates change. But as we've looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate h iking cycle,
we've come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we included in the modeling the effect  of deposit
repricing lags. And so, we've done that and that just has the effect that I talked about – it increases th e EaR number about $4 billion from
minus $1.5 billion, which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it would've been this quarter without the change to so mething more like
$2.5 billion.",2023,2
4,11,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Mor gan Stanley & Co. LLC,So then…,2023,2
5,11,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"All the usual caveats apply, right? I mean, it's never – the answer is going to always – for any given change in rates, the change in our NII is
always going to be for one reason or another different from what that disclosure shows. But we do our best to make it easy.",2023,2
6,11,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Okay. And so, is it fair for me to think about that change as a mark -to-market to where we are today? And when I think about your forward
guide here, longer -term you're saying, look, deposit betas are accelerating. So as I go through the 10 -Qs over the next four, five quarters, I
should expect that that $2.5 billion should come down because deposit betas you're anticipating are going to be acceler ating from here? I'm
just trying to put those two things together.",2023,2
7,11,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, it's a good question. It's quite a technical issue. So I think in the past, the way this number was constructed was to assume through -the-
cycle betas on all the deposits, and so your notion that like the number would  include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case
because it would've been using essentially terminal deposit betas based on the forward curve and then based on a 100% shock t o the forward
curve. The nuance that we've introduced now is to rec ognize that given the shock, the reprice that the beta predicts will not be instantaneous,
and so you get sort of just the mathematical consequences of that. But I think translating that into a statement about our ex pectation for beta
for the next 12 month s relative to our NII guide might be a bridge too far. I'm not sure you can actually draw that conclusion.",2023,2
8,11,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Mor gan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Right. But you were saying earlier deposit betas you do anticipate are going to be accelerating from here, and that's part of  the outlook for NII
longer -term to normalize in the mid -70s. Is that right?",2023,2
9,11,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yes, but let me emphasize something on that. Go ahead, Jamie.",2023,2
10,11,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, basically, yes. If you have – if the next round is going to be the beta will be 30 to 40 to 50 bps, I mean, whatever the product is,
yeah, that's the lag. And the $2.5 billion will go down over time as that actually happens – if rates actually go up. If rates don't actually go up,
that $2.5 billion may be exactly $2.5 billion again.",2023,2
11,11,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah.,2023,2
12,11,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,Got it.,2023,2
13,11,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, exactly. And what I was going to say, Betsy, is just that the projection of the $87 billion coming down to a significan tly lower number
contains both the element of internal migration as well as the potential, which is by no means guaranteed, of product -level reprice. And
furthermore then, obviously the dynamics are a little bit different in the different business segments as you move from large  corporate
Wholesale to  Consumer.",2023,2
14,11,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,Okay. All right. Thank you. Appreciate it.,2023,2
15,11,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah .,2023,2
0,12,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Good morning. So I'm in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. But I guess what wo uld make you
change your rates meaning fully? So the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share, loan -to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook
for loan growth, and I think others, is fairly sluggish, at least outside of Card. I get that it's common sense, and that's w hat we've seen
histo rically. But there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just don't ne ed to pay that
much for deposits for a slew of reasons. So what would make you change that?",2023,2
1,12,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. In the end, Matt, it's just feedback from the field. It's competition and feedback from the field. We – Jamie, go ahead.",2023,2
2,12,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I think every bank is in a different position about what they need, and so you have a whole range of outcomes. But remember, we do this also
by city, so you have different competition in Arizona – in Phoenix – than you have in Chicago, Illinois. And when you do have high interest rate
products, so it's a combination of all those things. I w ouldn't call it big bank versus small bank, and you're going to see when everyone reports
who kind of paid up a little more for things and who didn't and things like that. So, look, guys, I would take it as a given.  I think it's a mistake.
There is very li ttle pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up. Take it as a given. There is no circumstance that we 've
ever seen in the history of banking where rates didn't get to a certain point that you had to have competing products. And ra tes go up through
migration or direct rates or movement to CDs or money market funds. We're going to have to compete for that – you already see it in parts of
our business, and not in other parts.",2023,2
3,12,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,Yeah. I 100%...,2023,2
4,12,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Matt, it's really just about primary bank relationships in the end. That's the core of the strategy.",2023,2
5,12,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Yeah. I mean, again, I 100% agree, but we've never seen kind of loans -to-deposit ratios for banks like yours this low, so you could just let
deposits run off at a modest amount for quite some time and make the decision not to pay up. I mean, I've seen the trade -off that eventually
you'll...",2023,2
6,12,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"But that's a little more complicated because a lot of that loan -to-value ratio is lower because of regulatory stuff, LCR, capital ratio, etcetera.",2023,2
7,12,Matt O'Connor,Analy st,Inc.,Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you.,2023,2
8,12,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Thanks .,2023,2
0,13,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,P ortales Partners LLC,"Morning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful deterioration , or I shouldn't
say deterioration, depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republi c primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want
to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium
event – to have excess liquidity? So that's my first que stion. What's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?",2023,2
1,13,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Charlie, so I know we talked about this a little bit at Investor Day, right? So as I said in my prepared remarks, yeah,  we think about half
of the change in t he bank LCR number is a consequence of First Republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in system -wide
deposits flowing through into our HQLA balances and the bank LCR ratio. So that's all entirely as expected and therefore, I t hink that the
replenishing notion is not correct. In fact, obviously, we still have ample, ample liquidity. Now, if you want to project tre nds forward, that's a
different story but that's sort of the business of banking. We'll adjust accordingly in terms of our asset a nd liability mix across different products
and to ensure compliance to the ratios and fortress balance sheet principles as you would expect from us.",2023,2
2,13,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And I would just add to that – just look at the top of the page in the press release, $1.4 trillion of cash and marketable securities. Even if we get
down to no excess, we're going to have like, I forgot the exact number, $1.2 trillion. I think we have excess liquidity, and the liquidity ratio is
slightly somethin g different. I think there's plenty of liquidity in the system and, of course, we do multiple things to change this overnight  if we
wanted to.",2023,2
3,13,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,Portales Partners LLC,"All right. So sort of wrapped into that as a follow -up, if you take your $87 billion forecast for NII this year, and that implies at least one quarter
of maybe $22 billion of NII, and you take your eventual forecast of mid -$70 billion of NII at some point in the future, that would imply at least
one quarter of $18 billion of NII so  that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30 -basis point
Charles W. Peabody
Analyst, Portales Partners LLC  Q
drop in your margin, your NIM, to get from $22 billion to $18 billion. I mean, what is driving – is it really the deposit or are you thinking in term s
of interest reversals as credit deteriorates or is it rebuilding of liquidity? I'm just trying to get a better sense of the i mpact is.",2023,2
4,13,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Hey, Charlie. I would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story. It's just not that complicated, right? I think we did this – I
think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter – where we put a little chart on a page, just very simple terms, that shows what the
dollar consequences are of whatever – like 10 -basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of NII run rate. So whether it's as a
consequence of migration from lower -yielding to higher -yielding, going from 0% to a 4% CD is obviously a big impact on margin. Or whether
it's because  savings reprices, relatively small changes in rate there are kind of a lot of money when you've got a couple trillion dollars  of
deposits. So it's really not any more complicated than that and that's why we're being so forceful about reminding people abo ut what we
expect that trajectory to be.",2023,2
5,13,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,Portales Partners LLC,Thank you.,2023,2
0,14,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Thank you very much .,2023,2
1,14,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thank you, guys .",2023,2
0,1,John McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Hi, good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could give us a little more color in what you're seeing so far on deposit re price and
migration. What's been better than expected so far on that front? And how do you see higher -for-longer rates potentially impacting deposit
reprice pressure?",2023,3
1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So, as we talked a little bi t about on the
press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think
that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. A nd, of course, that hasn't
happened yet this year, so that's one factor.
In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting – continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money
in motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration.
But that’s sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say.
In terms of higher -for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration
and possibly moderate effects. And in the end, as we always say, we’re going to price products as a function of the competiti ve market
environment.",2023,3
2,1,John McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"And just as a follow up, it seems like you’ve done some securities repositioning the last couple quarters. How are you positi oning the balance
sheet in terms of cash and the securities portfolio, given your outlook for rates?",2023,3
3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I think I would say that while we're not predicting higher rates, I don't know if Jamie will have something to say here , we believe in being
prepared for it and that's been our position for some time and, of course, that's produced good results. And we continue to try to position
ourselves so that neither have significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large chal lenge to the company. So
probably at the margin, we're still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates. But, do keep in mind that when modeling th e duration of the
balance sheet, higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the  deposit side, so that can be a factor as well.",2023,3
4,1,John McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Okay, thanks.",2023,3
0,2,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Hey, good morning .",2023,3
1,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hey, Steve.",2023,3
2,2,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Hi. Jeremy, I was hoping to just inquire about the capital markets outlook. You cited improved activity levels in September. But given
persistently higher rates, geopolitical tensions, and just poor performance of recent IPOs, how are you thinking about the ou tlook over the near
to medium term? And how are you thinking about just the timing  of an inflection activity?",2023,3
3,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Good question. I mean, as you know obviously, the current levels in investment banking remain quite depressed; certainly relative to the
elevated levels we saw during the pandemic, but eve n relative to sort of 2019, which is what you might consider the last normal year. We do
eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels, recognizing by the time it happen s you will have
had many years of economi c growth in the meantime. And to be fair, while the current environment is a little bit complicated and mixed and
there are some headwinds as you pointed out, things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a  little bit more
optimistic than they were last quarter. So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum but o bviously significant
uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds given lower levels of announced M&A and some regulato ry headwinds on that side.",2023,3
4,2,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Thanks for the color. Just for my follow up, on some of the regulatory commentary you provided. Certainly, a lot of helpful c olor in the slides,
so thank you for that. If the proposal were to go through as written, what proportion of the inflation do you believe can be mitigated over time?
And was also hoping you could provide some context as to the quantum of how you think CECL inclusion could potentially impact  the SCB
and CCAR.",2023,3
5,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Finan cial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Those are all good questions, Steve. I think it's probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front. If I start first
with the Basel III Endgame proposal, from our perspective, we' re currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the
necessary changes. Some of which are what  you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things I highlighted in my prepared remarks,
but some of them are sort of very technical in nature, including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal. And so talking a
lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point.
I would point out that given how significant operational risk RWA is as part of the proposal, that is, you can think of that sort of as a generic tax
across the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense non -optimizable. So, we feel that it's important to manage expectations about the
level of op timization that's possible, once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed.
Also, it depends on your definition of optimization. Sometimes I use the term costless optimization, whereas these technical fixes that don’t
affect revenue and don’t require you to exit businesses; I think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past. But
as we pointed out, we may simply need to exit things. And that will be because it is better than the alternat ive, which would be to do activity
that’s shareholder value destructive but it won’t be costless.
A good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business, which as a result of the quadrupling of the ri sk weight, may no
longer make se nse. Now, that's one that we hope will be changed but it's tricky because those are very long duration assets. So between now
and the rule is finalized, it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet. So, sorry a  bit of a long answer
but then, yeah, on quantifying CECL and CCAR, I think we better wait for that one. Cause given the relative lack of transpare ncy that we have
into the Fed's exact modeling, in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth, it's  a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact
of putting CECL and CCAR is going to be. We just know probabilistically that it will, like everything else these days, tend t o push capital
higher.",2023,3
6,2,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Very helpful color, Jeremy. Thanks for taking my question.",2023,3
7,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah.,2023,3
0,3,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Hey. Good morning. Just first question, Jeremy, on credit. I think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the  change in the
central scenario. So just talk to us and remind us what the cen tral scenario is today, what changed? And then in terms of fundamentally on
credit, like where are you seeing softness either on the Consumer or the Commercial side?",2023,3
1,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So on the central scenario, you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team. No, but
in all seriousness, I think our U.S. economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with I think two quarters of
negative half a percent of G DP growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter of this year, and that then got revised out early this quarter to now
have sort of modest growth I think around 1% for a few quarters into 2024. So, just flowing that through our process while ac knowledging  that
we're still skewed to the downside, we're still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted -average basis than is in the
central case outlook. So that number we've sometimes given you is 5.5% this quarter. So, it's really not m uch more complicated than that.
We're just kind of following the process.
And I think your other question was where am I seeing softness in credit? And I think the answer to that is actually nowhere,  roughly. We're
certainly nowhere that's not expected, m eaning, we continue to see the normalization story play out in Consumer more or less exactly as
expected, and then of course, we are seeing a trickle of charge -offs coming through the office space. You see that in the charge -off number of
the Commercial Ba nk, but the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that we've already built there.",2023,3
2,3,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"That's helpful. And just going back to the details you laid out on Basel Endgame, maybe on the philo sophical side I think Jamie was speaking
last month, said that we don't expect any changes but at the same time, you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback. Is it
all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective? Are we resigned t o the fact that we are going to see more towards the worst -case
outcome play out or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized?",2023,3
3,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So I'll let Jamie speak for himself on that point, but our job is to advocate. We're not going to guess what the sentim ent is in
Washington. It's a thousand -page rule proposal, as you know. We've got the big team of very smart people studying it very  closely.
Interestingly, we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending, they sort of forgot about like – the Fed,
in their preamble, they forgot about a $1 billion (sic) [trillion] of  operational risk RWA. So it j ust highlights that there is the possibility, or seemed
to have forgotten, they simply omitted the impact of the operational risk RWA on fees.
So anyway, the point is it's long, it’s complicated, it’s technical. We do think there are probably some technical mistakes in there. We're not
going to forcefully advocate on all of those. And while we disagree with a lot of this stuff, these are technical issues that  should be, in some
sense, resolved technically, and hopefully they'll listen.",2023,3

3,4,Ryan Kenny,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Want to dig in on the NII side. So you raised the 2023 NII ex. Markets guidance by $2 billion for this year. So I know your c omments in the
press release suggest JPMorgan's over earning. So I just want to triangulate there. What does normalized NII look like? And do we get to
normalized next year or later on?",2023,3
4,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, a couple things. So, let me do the timing question first. So we're being very clear that we are not predicting when. When is going to be a
function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth. So we're just really ju st trying to
remind everyone to not bank on the current run rates, which we just don 't fundamentally think are sustainable.
You'll be aware that before Investor Day earlier this year, we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized rang e might look like,
and we put a sort of mid -70s type number out there. And at Investor Day , we talked about how the acquisition of First Republic was going to
push that number up a little bit, although there was some overlap and so on and so forth. So anyway, with the benefit of time  and having
everything settled in a little bit, if you sort of  push us for that, kind of, what is that number now look like, we think it’s probably closer to about
$80 billion, with all of the obvious caveats that this is a guess, and we don’t know when. But we’re just trying to point out  that it’s quite a bit
lower  than the current run rate.",2023,3

0,5,Ryan Kenny,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"And then on the loan growth side, industry loan growth has slowed significantly this year. What demand are you seeing for loa n growth across
the different categories? And I know it might be too early to talk about next year, but directionally, how should we think ab out loan growth
given where we are in the cycle and the higher capital requirements coming?",2023,3
1,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So on loan growth, the story is pretty consistent with what we've been saying all year. So we've, of course, seen  very robust loan
growth in Card, and that's coming from both spending growth and the normalization in revolving balances. As we look forward, we're still
optimistic about that, but it'll probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period.
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A
In Auto, we've also seen pretty robust loan growth recently, both as a function of sort of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the
industry was a little bit slow to raise rates. And so we lost some share previously, and that's come back now. And generally,  the supply chain
situatio n is better, so that's been supported. As we look forward there, it should be a little bit more muted.
And I think generally in Wholesale the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment. So depending  on what you
believe about soft landing, mild recession, no landing, you have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth. But in any case, I would ex pect it
to be relatively muted. And, of course, Home Lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions. But al so, and I think this
is true across the board, we will be managing things actively, as mentioned in light of Basel III, which may not change origi nations, but it will
change what we retain.",2023,3

2,6,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Jeremy, you guys have put up a really strong ROTCE number of 22% for the quarter. And when you dive into your different segme nts, what
really jumps out at us is the 40% ex -First Republic ROE in Consumer & Community Banking. I know you and Jamie have talked about your
over-earning on credit. We get that. But in view of all of these fintechs and all of these other nonbank competitors that we're al l supposed to
pick away at everybod y's market share, you guys have put up great numbers here. What's the drivers behind an ROE? Even when you take
that credit over -earning out, what's driving this business' profitability at such high levels?",2023,3
3,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Gerard. So I'd say a couple things there. So first, it's not just credit. It's also deposit margin, right? So when we talk ab out over -earning
on NII, a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the Consumer franchise for all of the reasons that we'v e talked about. But, I would
also point out sometimes we don't like the word over -earning because right now, customers are happy and they're doing CDs.
And the broader answer to your question about why we're able to be effectively really comes back to a d ecade, two decade long history of
investing for the future and recognizing that there's a holistic value proposition here that includes branches, and the app, and all of the online
services, and the entire suite of products and services that is around this  enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty. And we're
seeing some of the benefits of that now, although we're not complacent. The competition is still there. The fintechs are stil l there, and we know
we need to continue investing to preserve the value. And it's also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit
environment mean that the earnings are a little bit above normal, but that core franchise is extremely robust.",2023,3
4,6,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Very good. And then as a follow up, which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments you and
Jamie about the internal debate inside JPMorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side. Your non -interest -bearing
deposits I think are around 28% of total deposits which is slightly above the 26% you guys had back in 2018 or 2019 or pre -pandemic. Is this
expectation that you're going to see more of the non -interest -bearing depos its go into interest -bearing? Or, is it just the repricing of interest -
bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside JPMorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number?",2023,3
5,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. It's a good question, Ge rard. I think it's a little bit bigger picture than that. And I'm not sure – I get your questions, a good question, but
I'm not sure that the reported interest -bearing, non -interest -bearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of rea sons. So first,
like between Wholesale and Retail, we've got some amount of non -interest -bearing and Wholesale that's part of the ECR product, so you see
some dynamics there that play out. And in Consumer, in a world where savings is paying a relatively lo w-rate paid to cross -checking and
savings, the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now.
But then of course, even within Consumer across both consumers and small businesses, you've got slightly different dynamics i n terms of how
people  manage their operating balances. So I would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer, that's driven by  internal
migration from checking, savings to CDs, from ECR to interest -bearing and Wholesale and then our potential response to t he rate
environment, the competitive environment, the overall level of system -wide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not
happen in moments in the future.",2023,3
6,6,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,Great. Thank you .,2023,3
0,7,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS S ecurities LLC,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, my first question is for you, again sort of maybe re -asking the question in a different way. Your new guide for net
interest income for this year would imply an exit run rate of $22.9 billion in the fourth quarter . As we think about the dynamics in higher -for-
longer, on one hand, your fixed rate assets will continue to reprice. On the other, you even asked a lot about the deposit dy namics that could
continue to creep higher. How do we think about those puts and tak es as we think about that relative to that exit rate of $22.9 billion in the
fourth quarter?",2023,3
1,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, Erika, I think the simple answer to your question is I believe that fourth quarter exit number equates to a $90 billion run rate ex.
Markets and we're kind of saying...",2023,3
2,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,$22.5 billion.,2023,3
3,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financi al Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah. Isn't that what I meant to say?,2023,3
4,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,She said $22.9 billion.,2023,3
5,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Oh, I didn't hear that, okay. Anyway...",2023,3
6,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,We didn’t model it that way.,2023,3
7,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So call it $90 billion run rate on an exit rate basis, and we're saying that we think something a bit more normal is closer t o $80 billion, so that's
one building block.
Underneath that, I think one thing that's interesti ng actually, is that as the percentage of the deposits which are CDs increases, the sort of
balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume, it's a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother, so  when we look at this
type of stuff and  we model migration, balances, product level reprice, as you get out of that lower zero bound with 0% CD mix world, things get
a little bit smoother, I would say, overall.
So it'll be interesting to watch that, but it's obviously one of the most important  things for us as a company right now and we do everything we
can to manage it, but it's also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise and as we've often said, we're very
focused on primary bank relationships and we didn't lose any of those in the last cycle, and we're not planning to lose any in this cycle, and
that's what sort of a long -term focus means for us.",2023,3
8,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And I would just add quantitative tightening in there. That will be a large number, and we don't exactly know the effect, where wholesale,
consumer as – remember also the Fed has the R RP program which is also sucking money into the Fed directly and reducing deposits. That's
still a trillion too.",2023,3
9,7,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS S ecurities LLC,"Thank you. And my second question is on maybe zooming out on the Basel III Endgame impacts. It's clearly complex, overly comp lex, and I
completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward looking. I guess, what is not complex is the fact that you
generated 75 basis points of CET1 this quarter while your RWAs are down. And I guess my question here is, is that I understan d that we're in
the public advocacy process.
I hear you loud and clear in terms of  how this could have harm in terms of pricing for Main Street and dislocating the pipes in American capital
markets. But for JPMorgan, does this change your natural return profile of 17%? Jamie, I know you lingered a little bit on 14 % when you were
at Barc lays in September. But at the end of the day, it feels like for the portfolio managers that own JPMorgan through the cycle, d oes Basel III
Endgame really harm your natural earnings power and returns?",2023,3
10,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Okay. That's a good question, Erika. I think there's a couple pieces in there, so let me take the most important piece first, which  is the
17% through the cycle target. Are we keeping that or not in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal? So, short answer is we 're not going to
change that number today, but when you look at what we've disclosed about a 25% increase in capital, you have to start by ack nowledging
that that is a major headwind to returns.
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A
In simple terms, you talk about earnings power and returns, but they're two different things, right. We have to be a little bit pedantic and do
numerator and denominator here. Okay, so say the numerator doesn't change. If you just dilute down the numerator by the incre ased capital,
that's a significantly lower retu rn number.
I would say that that's probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the Basel III Endgame for a couple reasons. One is , we are hoping
for changes. Two is, once the rule is final, we will seek to reprice in the places where we can. And th at'll be different in Consumer and
Wholesale, some of it will be product level, some of it will be relationship level, but that hopefully can mitigate some of i t but of course the flip
side of that is that's cost getting passed into the real economy and th at's part of the point that we've made about lowering availability of
products and services and lending. There may be some opportunities for costless optimization. I'm personally a little bit mor e pessimistic about
those, but we've surprised ourselves on t hose points in the past, so we'll see.
And then finally, yeah, we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things. But, I wouldn't necessarily assume that that 's going to do a lot
to preserve returns at the 17%. That's going to be about exiting thing s that are shareholder -destructive, but not necessarily producing much
higher returns, if you know what I mean.
So that's that, and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and I think it's just very imp ortant
to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on long -term returns from our ability to meet the requirements. Of course, as Jamie always
says, JPMorgan is going to be fine and we're building a lot of capital and we were managing capital conservativ ely and we'll be able to build
the necessary capital in order to achieve on -time or early compliance, which is always what we strive to do, but that doesn't really have any
particular bearing on the question of what the long -term return target is or the im pacts on the real economy.",2023,3
11,7,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,Got it. Thank you.,2023,3
0,8,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Hi. Thank you. So I very much appreciate the comments in the release on the big picture things, what's going on in the world and their
potential impact on markets, on food ma rkets, global trade, everything that you mentioned, and sadly agree about the most dangerous time in
decades. The question I have is, does it surprise you that markets are hanging in, that you, yourself, have green shoots or s till green shoots
type of mind set about banking while that's going on? And then maybe more importantly, if you believe what obviously what you wrote, what
are you doing about it? How do you manage yourself conservatively? How do you prepare for tougher times?",2023,3
1,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorga n Chase & Co.,"Go ahead, Jeremy.",2023,3
2,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"You want to start? Okay. So, I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momen tum. I do think
we are a little bit more optimistic than we were, but obviously, markets have bee n bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been
very whippy recently. So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming in off a very low base and s o there's a
hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalizatio n and improvement. And of course, the overall economic picture at least
currently looks solid, this sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a lit tle bit optimistic in the
near-term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution.",2023,3
3,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So I would add a question. There has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system, and you can't look at, and
of course, it can drive markets in sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but you can't stay like this forever. Betwee n QT, if you never had
and how much the fiscal stimulus could continue at this rate before you h ave kind of the crowding out kind of factor. So I think people have to
be very cautious, and of course, the geopolitics I think is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prep are the company
for that?
We do 100 stress tests a week, an d we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems, interest rate problems, but usually, geopolitics
presents itself as a deep recession or a mild recession, or a recession part of the world, or markets going down a lot, and b ecause markets do
well is not a reason, ever, to say that they are going to continue to do well.
If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection p oints. But my
caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You just got to be very cautious with what you're facing. And like I said, the other
thing about the green shoots, regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out, better products and
better services, securely, safely, and all those things, so that's the ultimate goal.
We know there are going to be bad times. That's not a surprise that there are going to be bad times. We don't always know how they're
coming, and where they're coming fro m, but we'll keep on serving clients and doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of
separate from what it does to your returns. That's a slightly different issue at this point, but we'll deal with that too whe n we figure out what to
do.",2023,3
4,8,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Thank you for all that, all good.",2023,3
5,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Glenn.",2023,3
0,9,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Hi. I understand the NII strategy benefited from First Republic, asset sensitivity, CD strategy, money in motion, and I'm cur ious to how much is
the NII increase and the deposit benefits a function of the 67 million digital banking customers? Do you have more digital banking cu stomers
than branch customers now? If you can just refresh that.
And then a more general question. I guess I have the first one fo r Jeremy and the second one for Jamie. You have record tech spend. What's
the benefit of having record tech spend, if you can kind of mark -to-market your thoughts there as it relates to AI, as it relates to maybe wasted
spending, your outlook for next year ? And does it really help to be the biggest tech spender in the banking industry?",2023,3
1,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yes. Let me do digital banking, Mike. I spent some time on this actually a couple weeks ago. And it's interesting to note thi s sort of extent to
which the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts, meaning that we're co ntinuing to
increase the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged. And it sort of goes back to my prior poi nt...",2023,3
2,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,But the percent who are digital only is much lower than that .,2023,3
3,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"For sure. For sure. Which actually links to the broader point that what – in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current
NII story, it goes to the larger point of it holistic through the cycl e, multichannel, fully engaged customer strategy which requires a lot of
investment in branches, obviously, but also in digital services of all sorts. So in many ways, you can see the current enviro nment as a little bit
of a payoff of that investment. But that's not like, therefore, we stop investing, obviously.
So I guess that's part of the answer. And I guess your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender. I ju st think like it's sort
of mandatory, right? I mean we're big and it's a  very technology -centric business , and the world is competitive, and everything is changing.
Younger generations have different expectations, and we have to be nimble, and we have to be on our front foot. And otherwise , we risk
getting severely disrupted. So I don't know if Jamie wants to add anything.",2023,3
4,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Just the competition, when we look at it, it's Wells, who's coming back, which I'm happy for you guys. It's obviously Marcus,  it's Apple, it's
Chime, it's Dave. Ther e are a lot of people coming up after these businesses in different ways, and there some have been quite successful.
It's Stripe in payments. And so we want to be very good and very competitive. Some of that tech spending is things which are almost a sine
qua non, which is cybersecurity, data center resiliency, regulatory requirements, and things like that, which we simply are g oing to do and be
very, very good at to protect the company.",2023,3
5,9,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"As it relates to AI specifically, which is the tal k of the town, I guess the consensus among people outside the banking industry is that banks will
not win that battle, including JPMorgan. You won't control the front end. What are you doing with AI to make a difference now , or is this just
simply a moon s hot?",2023,3
6,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Oh, I don't agree with that statement. Banks have an extraordinary amount of proprietary data in addition to when you do like  a large language
model, that's public data, looking at everything on the internet or ev erything that's ever been published or something like that. But AI is an
extraordinarily good tool to use. We just put a woman who's running it at our table. So it's data analytics, AI, et cetera. A nd there are multiple
types of AI. So we use AI for risk, fraud, marketing, prospecting. And the management team's getting better and better at saying how can we
use the data to do a better job to reduce errors, to serve clients better, to have a salesperson have co -pilots so they know to widen the client's
coin or something like that. And so, we simply have to do it. Does it create opportunity for disruptors to come in? Yeah, of cours e. That's
always been true with technology. And, but, we'll be quite good at it .",2023,3
7,9,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"And then lastly, I think you h ad made a mention at a conference about investment spend or tech spend over the next year. Where do you
stand on that?",2023,3
8,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Now because you did ask a little bit about the expense outlook for next year. So I think at the conference we said, I think the consensus
was $88 billion, but we're still going through the budget process, et cetera, et cetera. So that's still true. I think we're still kind of in the ballpark,
but I would say at the margin there's going to be a li ttle bit of upward pressure.",2023,3
9,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Is that for First Republic too, or no?",2023,3
10,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, this is all now including First Republic. And I think there will be a little bit of upward pressure on t hat as we sort of do our usual thing and
look at all of the opportunities that we see and the investments that we want to make. So no surprise in that sense that we'r e going to invest
prudently. Nothing dramatic, but probably a little bit of upward pressur e at the margin.",2023,3

12,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Thank you.,2023,3
0,10,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, do you think there's any receptivity among regulators regarding the double counting not only of op erational risk
but I think you alluded to this earlier in the Markets business, but there's clearl y double counting in market risk in the trading book. Is there any
receptivity?",2023,3
1,10,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Can I just answer that real quickly? We don't really know. It's a one -sided conversation generally. They say put it in your comments, so
everyone is going to put in extensive comments, kind of like you heard from Jeremy and we don't really know. We don't really know what's
going on inside the Fed, how many people get involved. In my view, it's become a very politicized process as opposed to the technical
analysis I think is required to do it exactly right. So we'll see.",2023,3
2,10,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Okay. And then if it weren't to change, and you talked about the potential negative impact on liquidity in the Markets busine ss specifi cally, is
that a JPM pulling out of certain businesses type event? Or is it more a comment that there'd be fewer providers of liquidity  as less scaled
players exit, and maybe that's almost equal a market share gain opportunity for JPMorgan in a smaller bus iness?",2023,3
3,10,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I think so if you look at Markets alone, it's a huge, I think 60%, increase in capital. And if you look at it, you can do tha t by product. For some
products it's worse than for others, but general ly it's bad across all products. But the really important thing is market making is a critical
function and if you look at the world, only some of these large market makers who could make markets for governments, hospita ls, cities,
schools, states, IMF, Wo rld Bank, BlackRock, Blackstone, and all those various things who buy and sell for their clients in size. And market
makers have a different function than hedge funds, and I don't know what the real intent was with this. This is another one I  think that ne eds to
be really thought through with what are you trying to accomplish.
We do market making quite safe. We've never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global mark et shock or
something like that, but the other thing abou t market making, I do agree, it could actually force some people out. It will force lower positions
which is why I think it's a little risky, but it may also force more consolidation. And so clients, since they need it so muc h, there may be
consolidation i n an unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints, with the LCR, SLR,
capital, et cetera, you will constantly be up against limitations in what you can do.",2023,3
4,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And I think that last point of Jamie's is particularly important because, sure, if you want, you can construct what I would c onsider a very
optimistic argument that the higher cost of doing business will lead smaller scale players to exit and that's a shar e gain opportunity for us, but
if I refer back to the comments about the disincentives to beneficial diversification and scale, getting bigger, especially i n markets is quite
expensive from, for example, a GSIB perspective, and so you wind up kind of hemme d in on all sides which is one of the reasons why we're
sort of highlighting, but it does seem like the only way out, sometimes, when you look at the cumulative effect of everything  that's happened in
markets over the last 15 years, is a fundamentally very  different system, and while obviously...",2023,3
5,10,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Great opportunity for European market makers. I mean, a great opportunity, like they can do repo and FX and swaps and credit and stuff with
30% less capital. That is a big  difference in that kind of business.",2023,3
6,10,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,Right. That's helpful. Thanks.,2023,3
0,11,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Hi, good morning. You talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question. But just how do you think
about cost control overall, looking at the medium term? The outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest inc ome. Fees
might help, but the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple or few years.  So, I know you always
say you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control the nex t few years?",2023,3
1,11,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework. But in some fundamental sense, we just kind of don't agree
with the framework in the sense that and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right? In a world where rates  drop very
suddenly and recover like quite dramatic ally, and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you've seen these very significant
fluctuations in capital markets. We  saw that in 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for
reasons that can be  largely out of your control.
And while of course there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term directly sensitive to the revenue enviro nment and some
of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes, but other things are much more structural. And
the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle ret urns are. So we're
always very focused on  cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget
cycle. But there are long -term plays and you really shouldn’t expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response t o a
lower revenue environment where we didn’t balloon the costs when the revenue became as we’ve argued unsustainably high.",2023,3
2,11,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Yeah. Fair enough. And if I could just squeeze in on First Republic, obviously the contribution there is coming in multiples higher -than-
expected. How do you think about the puts and takes in terms of, I think there's probably some run -off of loans still to come, but also
opportunities to deepen the relationships there?",2023,3
3,11,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorga n Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So you're right about the contribution and about the run -off of loans, and it is notable the First Republic related net income that we've
printed this quarter – so the first thing to say is that we don't think that that First Republic related net income number from this quarter is a
sustainable indicator of the future run rate. Some of the same dynamics that we've just talked about, in particular, over -earning on deposits or
sort of above normal on deposit margins, also apply t o the First Republic franchise to some degree. So we would expect that to normalize.
And probably more significantly as the things you alluded to, we do have some accelerated pull to par on some of the commitme nts that we
took on at a fair value discount a s part of the acquisition, so that's a short -term tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next
few quarters.
And yeah, in terms of how it's going overall and deepening the relationships, that remains a focus and I think more of that w ill happen as we
continue the integration and we continue stabilizing. And yeah, I think as I said on the press call, things are going well ar guably a little bit
better than we'd sort of modeled as part of the acquisition, and we're happy to see that.",2023,3
4,11,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,Okay. Thank you very much.,2023,3
0,12,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Thank you very much.,2023,3
0,1,Matt O’Connor,Analyst,Inc.,Good morning. Thanks for all the comments on the net interest income. Any updates on that medium term outlo ok that you've put out there ?,2023,4
1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we'd put out there, and I wou ldn't exactly describe
that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over earning . So, not
particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out, again, as we highlight on the page, and as I hig hlighted in the prepared
remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiti ng below $88 billion and
some significant sequential decline. So, in that sense, you can see us kind of ma rching on the path to that $80 billion. Whether we ever get to
the $80 billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year .",2023,4
2,1,Matt O’Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Okay. And then just separately, you bought back couple of billion dollars of stock this quarter. What's your thought process on buybacks given
the strong capital generation, but also some uncertainty on regulatory proposals ?",2023,4
3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Good question. And I think you framed it exactly correctly in the sense that we obviously have a lot of buyback capacity in g eneral
based on our organic capital generation. So, the normal capital hierarchy will apply. But for now, we plan to remain on a mo dest pace of
buybacks consistent with that kind of $2 billion net buyback a quarter number that we've talked about and that you've seen us  do, in light of the
– probably the need to continue building to have a bit of a buffer, as you said, the uncertainty about the finalization of the rules. And also just
as a reminder, the SCB is probably a little bit low right now and has been quite volatile. So, that's another factor that we need to keep in mind .",2023,4

5,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Matt.",2023,4
0,2,John McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Thanks. Jeremy, could you give a little more color on what's baked into the loan loss reserve in terms of kind of weighted av erage
assumptions and how any change in macro outlook played into the dynamics of the reserve builds and releases this quarter ?",2023,4
1,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So, the weighted average unemployment rate number is still 5.5%. We didn't have
any really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers, and our skew remains as it has been – a little bit skewed to the downside.
Just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously you can see that skew in the difference between the weighted average
unemployment of 5.5%, and what's in our central outlook, which I think is somethin g like 4.6% (sic) [4.4%]  peak of the current levels.",2023,4
2,2,John McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Okay. And then, just to follow up on the NII, could you give us some sensitivity to that outlook when you flex the amount of Fed cuts? Like
what's the impact of a few Fed cuts and how much does it matter like for the first two versus if you're thinking four, five, six? I know  it's
complicated, but maybe a little bit of color on like how sensitive you are to a couple of cuts might be helpful .",2023,4
3,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Yeah, happy to do that, John. So, I think probably the best way to do this is to look at our EaR numbers. So, as you kn ow, we don't
update that until the Q. But on an estimated basis, it's going to be a little bit low er. So, I think something like $1.9 billion as opposed to $2.1
billion. So, just round numbers, about $2 billion in EaR. I think, empirically, the number is maybe a little higher than that  just because even
though we do model lags in the EaR, we've been se eing the lag effect be a little bit bigger. But just crudely, I think as I noted, we do remain
asset -sensitive. That's one way to quantify it. I would say the empirical number would maybe be a little higher than that, and hope fully, that
gives you enough t o work with .",2023,4
4,2,John McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,Okay. Thanks .,2023,4
0,3,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seapor t Global Securities LLC,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just to follow up in a different way on the NII question, just in deposits, can you, Jeremy, discuss  your assumptions
on the reprice and migration thoughts? And then, layering in if we do get six cuts, does that start to change the dynamic around growth in
deposits? How are you thinking about all that ?",2023,4
1,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the
effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product -level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal
migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in Who lesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non -interest -bearing into
interest -bearing.
And that trajectory, I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted av erage rate paid, for
example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six  cuts.
And that's actually intuitive when you think about it, as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little non -intuiti ve if you're kind of
trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid. It gets a little bit non -intuitive.
And then, in terms of balances, yeah, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down , which when you
consider the QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues and that loan growth  in the system as
a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So, I kind of agree with you that this
environment is at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system -wide deposit balances. And then, obviously, we continue to be optimistic
about our ability to take share in deposits based on our cust omer value proposition across all of our different businesses .",2023,4
2,3,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,Right. Okay. Thanks a lo t.,2023,4
0,4,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Hey. Good morning. I guess maybe one question looking at your statement, and I think Jamie is quoted as saying as he sees the  consumer as
resilient and the market expecting a soft landing. I would love to hear – I'm not sure Jamie's on the call – but maybe, Jeremy, I would love to
hear your thoughts around do you believe that the outlook for a soft landing has increased? Is the market pricing in correctl y? Or when you
look at your customer base, are you still worried abou t the lagged effects of the rate hikes ?",2023,4
1,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. Okay, Ebrahim. So, I think a lot of those things aren't actually mutually exclusive. So, statement one, I think it's u ncontroversial that the
economic outlook has evolved to include a significantly higher probability of a soft landing. That's, I think, the consensus at this point. So,
whether you believe it or not is a separate issue, but I think that is the consensus.
In terms of consumer resilience, I made some c omments about this on the press call. The way we see it, the consumer is fine. All of the
relevant metrics are now effectively normalized. And the question really, in light of the fact that cash buffers are now also  normal, but that that
means that consume rs have been spending more than they're taking in, is how that spending behavior adjusts as we go into the new year in a
world where their cash buffers are less comfortable than they were.
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A
So, one can speculate about different trajectories that that could take. But I do think it's important to take a step back an d remind ourselves
that consistent with that soft landing view, just in the central case modeling – obviously, we always worry abou t the tail scenarios – is a very
strong labor market. And a very strong labor market means, all else equal, strong consumer credit. So, that's how we see the world .",2023,4
2,4,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"And maybe just taking that a step further, there has been concern around whether we see some of the CRE pain filter into multi -family
apartments. You all have a pretty large multi -family exposure, high quality. But just give us a sense of, one, are you seeing any bleed -through
of what we've seen in office in  other areas of commercial real estate or any particular parts of C&I lending? Thank you .",2023,4
3,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, good question on the multi -family, and the short answer is that, for us, it's pretty uncontroversially  no – no bleed -through. And the
reason is that while we are aware of some of the pressure on multi -family, that's in kind of different markets from the ones that we are actually
big in. So, it's higher -end stuff in much less supply constrained markets that is under more pres sure. And as you know, our multi -family
portfolio is much more affordable, supply constrained markets. And so, the performance there remains really very robust .",2023,4
4,4,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,Got it.  Thank you.,2023,4
0,5,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS S ecurities LLC,"Hi. Good morning. My first question is a follow -up on Matt's with regarding the buyback. You printed 15% CET1 in the quarter. On a net basis,
net of RWA growth, your net income produces 51 basis points every quarter. Again, that's net of R WA growth. I'm wondering what guideposts
you're looking for, Jeremy, in terms of that buyback increasing from that $2 billion a quarter. Do we need to wait for Basel III finalization, which
seems like it could be quite delayed? Or will having clarity in th e June D -FAST results – you mentioned the SCB – sort of be enough that you
could reconsider this pace over the medium term ?",2023,4
1,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Erika, that's a good question. And I understand what you're asking – why you're asking it. I think the answer is going to be a little bit
unsatisfying, which is that this is classic decision -making under uncertainty and it's kind of a probabilistic cloud of a variety of different factors.
But, all the ingredients that you've listed are the r ight ingredients; right, very strong organic capital generation, uncertainty about the
finalization of the rule, uncertainty about the SCB requirements, and obviously, our normal capital hierarchy, which is that buybacks are always
at the bottom of the hie rarchy after we're done using the capital for our other priorities.
So, I think what I said previously stands, which is that we're sticking with the modest pace for now. But obviously, we have a lot of flexibility to
adjust that whenever we want under the  current regime, and we may well do that .",2023,4
2,5,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Thanks. And just as a follow -up, the $90 billion in expenses for 2024, does that contemplate a significant increase or the comeback of
investment banking that everybody seems to be expecting for 2024 ?",2023,4
3,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"A little bit of that is in there, yeah. So, you would see that. We often talk about the volume in revenue related category, a nd I think in my
prepared remarks, you will have noted that I talked  about a $1 billion increase in that category year -on-year as a result of an improved NIR
outlook. So, the hope and expectation of a continued rebound in the investment banking wallet and our share of that is part of that .",2023,4
4,5,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,Thank you.,2023,4
0,6,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Hi. So, you're guiding to $90 billion of expenses, that's up $7 billion year -over-year. Seems like quite a big increase. And if you could just give
some color on that. I know we've been through this before two years ago with the big  increase in expenses and without a lot of visibility. So, if
you could just upfront give us visibility, how much of that is due to incentive pay, how much is that due to tech, how much i s that due to AI and
what are the expected returns to get from that $ 7 billion pick -up? Thanks .",2023,4
1,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Mike, thanks for the question. And yeah – and of course, you will, as I noted, be hearing more from us at Investor Day and between now
and Investor Day. But I will take a little bit of extr a time here to answer your question, because you're right, it's important to give you the
transparency. And I'm going to follow the structure that we used on the page and go through each line of business.
So, starting with CCB, it's the biggest dollar dri ver overall. It's an 8% increase year -on-year, which is about the same as we had last year. One
key driver is the branch strategy and the associated staff for that. In 2023, we built 166 new branches, and we're planning a bout a similar
number this year. Ma rketing is also a driver. We're seeing great opportunities, great demand and engagement in our Card products. And so,
that shows up in marketing. And as you well know, our wealth strategy in CCB remains a big focus and priority.
I think it's worth noting here, right, that as we've talked about and as you know, Mike, some of our investments are designed to produce short -
term payoffs and some of them are much longer -term and some of them are just table stakes. But we actually see quite a bit of evidence of
current payoffs in our current results in the CCB investment. So, for example, in 2023, we had 2 million net new checking acco unts. We had
an 8% growth in active card accounts. And over the last three years, we've increased deposit market share by 180 basis  points. So, as we've
often said about the company as a whole, we're very happy to be producing very good current returns and growth while investin g for the
future.
In AWM, continued client advisor hiring is a key driver, as well as making sure that both the advisors and all of their new clients have the
support that they need. And a little bit to the prior question, in AWM, we also have a little bit of volume and revenue -related driver tied to an
improved revenue outlook.
The Commercial Bank is an i nteresting story in the sense that about half of it is the exit rate impact of ads that we did in the middle of the year
based on market disruption and all the kind of new clients and new loans that we saw and the need to support that across the entire
ecosystem. As well as the fact that that created an opportunity in the middle of the year to accelerate our longstanding and pre existing
innovation economy strategy. So, we took some opportunities to onboard some key teams in different parts of the franchise.  And then, as you
look into 2024, it's really pretty consistent themes to the ones that we had before, including hiring bankers both domestical ly and
internationally.
The CIB story is a little bit different. The percentage growth there is lower, which rec ognizes, I think, both our very, very strong share positions
as a starting point and also the fact that we've been investing quite aggressively for some time in the Payments business, wh ich has produced
meaningful payoffs already there in terms of signific ant share gains. So, as a result, the biggest driver in the CIB is really generic inflation,
including labor as well as, again to the prior question, volume and revenue -related increases tied to the improved NIR outlook. And I do want
to say for the avoida nce of doubt that despite all of this, our core strategy of looking very granularly at all the areas of strength and weakness
and making sure that we're upgrading where appropriate to have absolutely the best talent in the CIB remains fully in effect.
Jere my Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A
Finally, you'll note that I haven't actually talked about technology in any of the businesses, and that's actually because ev en though all of the
businesses in various ways are investing in technology and spending money on it, the drivers are actually very consistent across the entire
firm, even though it's very bottoms -up driven. And those drivers are consistent with what they've been, new products, features and customer
platforms, as well a s modernization. So, that's happening throughout the company both at the app level and otherwise. And I will say actually
in closing, talking about technology – which I think is interesting – that to the point about a driver being growth writ large, one of  the things that
we see is higher volume -related technology expense throughout the company. So, thanks for the question, Mike. It was a good opportunity to
give you guys a bit more color here .",2023,4
2,6,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,Okay. I have a short follow -up. I'm still here .,2023,4
3,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Sure .,2023,4
4,6,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Farg o Securities LLC,"Yeah. Can you just talk about the impact of AI on your technology approach? And I know I’ve asked you this before and you sai d you're
spending it, you're being careful, you want to see a return on your dollars. But how much difference can this make? How big is your tech
budget last year? How much should it be this year? How much could AI make a difference? Just a little more meat on the tech b ones .",2023,4
5,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So, let me address the AI point, and I think maybe I won't go into a lot of quantitative detail on this stuff and I'll save that for
Investor Day, if you don't mind. But, I will address the AI point. So, as you may be aware, we actually have Teresa Heitsenre ther now running
the AI strategy for the company as a member of the Operating Committee, which I think is an indication of the priority that we place  on this,
and in partnership with Lori and all of the technology organization.
So, I think that – I think of this as being a littl e bit barbelled, where on the one hand, we're very excited about this. There's clearly some very
significant opportunities, not for nothing, starting with technology developers themselves in terms of the opportunity for si gnificantly increased
productivity  there. At the same time, we're JPMorgan Chase. We're not going to be chasing shiny objects here in AI. We want to do this in an
extremely disciplined way, it's very commercial and very linked to tangible outcomes. And so, the current focus is on making sure we have a
contained, well -chosen list of high -impact use cases and that we're throwing resources at those in the right way, that's extremely pragmatic
and disciplined, and we're holding ourselves accountable for actual results .",2023,4

0,7,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Hi, Jeremy. How are you ?",2023,4
1,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hey, Gerard .",2023,4
2,7,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Jeremy, coming back to your outlook and forecast for net interest income for the upcoming year with the six Fed fund rate cut s that you guys
are assuming, can you give us a little insight why you're assuming six cuts? Is it your customers are telling you that their businesses are
weaker or is it your just economic outlook, the forward curve? Can you give us something behind why you're assuming so many r ate cuts ?",2023,4
3,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Gerard, I wish the answer were more interesting, but it's just our practice. We just always use the forward curve for o ur outlook, and
that's what's in there .",2023,4
4,7,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Okay, very good. And then, as a follow -up, obviously, you pointed out also in the outlook you're going to have some deposit attrition. You had
some, of course, in 2023. Can you guys give us some insights on the impact QT is having on the deposit base for your organiza tion? And
second, ar e you surprised that QT hasn't been more disruptive to the liquidity in the markets ?",2023,4
5,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I mean, I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus and one of  the complicating
elements that we have in the current environment. I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing from
system -wide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset, hopefully, by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so,  that's been
supportive of system -wide deposits.
As we g o into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know,  that there's –
the market's expectation is that QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So – and we still have reasonable levels of reserves
and some cushion from RRP. So, that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down, with the shrin kage in system -
wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share. But, a lso I think the second half of this year is going to be
interesting to watch in terms of what the Fed does .",2023,4
6,7,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,Great. Thank you .,2023,4
7,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Gerard .",2023,4
0,8,Manan Gosalia,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. There has been a lot of talk about capital markets rebound. You noted you' re starting the
year with a healthy pipeline. Could you give us some more color on what you're seeing there and how the rate in – how the change in the rate
environment is changing the conversations that you're having across M&A, ECM and DCM ?",2023,4
1,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So, as you know, all else equal, this more dovish rate environment is of course supportive for capital markets. So, if you go into
the details a little bit, if you start with ECM, that helps. Higher and – well, the recent rally in the equity markets helps. I think there've been
some modest challenges with the 2023 IPO vintage in terms of post -launch performance or whatever. So, that's a little bit of a headwind at the
margin in terms of converting the pipeline, but I'm not too concerned about that in general. So, I would expect to see reboun d there.
In DCM, ag ain, all else equal, lower rates are clearly supportive. One of the nuances there is the distinction between the absolute lev el of rates
and the rate of change, that sometimes you see corporates seeing and expecting lower rates, and therefore, waiting to r efinance in the hope
of even lower rates. So, that can go both ways. And then, M&A is a slightly different dynamic. I think there's a couple nuanc es there. One, as
you obviously know, announced volume was lower this year. So, that will be a headwind in rep orted revenues in 2024, all else equal. And of
course, we are in an environment of M&A regulatory headwinds, as has been heavily discussed. But having said that, I think we 're seeing a bit
of pick -up in deal flow, and I would expect the environment to be a  bit more supportive .",2023,4
2,8,Manan Gosalia,Analyst,Morgan  Stanley & Co. LLC,"Great. And on the flip side, in C&I, you spoke about lower revolver utilization, more muted demand. What would it take for th at to rebound? Do
you think it accelerates from here if rates come down or is there room for this to slow eve n further if the capital markets open up even more ?",2023,4
3,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. It's a good question. I mean, I think as you say, it's a little bit of a – I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say that, like, lack of debt market
access in the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that drive revolver utilization. I think the main driver the re is just a
little bit of residual anxiety in the C -suite, which increases as the companies get smaller in size.
So, it's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be, I woul d
think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapE x and so on, and
so you might see utilization even lowe r.",2023,4

5,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah .,2023,4
0,9,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercor e ISI,"Hi. Thank you. So, I want to get your perspective on private credit overall. The industry saw a lot of growth, but it's only so big relative to the
banking market. I think there's been a lot of share shift in direct lending and middle market lending. But n ow, you're starting to see more in
Glenn Schorr
Analyst, Evercore ISI  Q
asset -backed finance and you're seeing them raise a lot of money in infrastructure and energy. So, my question to you is, how big o f a trend is
this? How much do you think about it as cyclical versus secular? And most importantly, how does JPMorgan adapt and participate?",2023,4
1,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, I think the last part of your question, as you say, is the most important part, which is this as an important factor in
the competitive dynamic and what is one of the key things that we offer as a company. So, it is a meaningful shift in the env ironment and
something that we've been watching for some time.
We've made some enhancements and some new initi atives to ensure that we can compete effectively both in our traditional syndicated
lending businesses, but also go head -to-head with the private credit providers in these types of unitranche structures, if and when that's what
the client actually wants. I t tends to be a trade -off between the best possible pricing versus speed and certainty of execution, and we can
provide both off our sort of exceptionally strong long -time DCM franchise. So, that's been a priority, and we're actually already starting to se e
some results from that across both the Commercial Bank and the CIB with certain client segments.
And in the bigger picture, of course, in the context of the Basel III Endgame, people talk a lot about the risk of certain le nding activity getting
pushed o ut of the regulated perimeter. It's important to be clear, right, these are important clients of ours too. We compete with th em. They're
also clients. And in the end, our point here is just people, and regulators in particular, should just be aware of the likely consequences of
what's happening here and make sure that the results are intentional and that we're looking around the corner a little bit.",2023,4
2,9,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,Anything specific on asset -backed? It's an important part of your business too. Do you see it following the same path as direct lending ha s?,2023,4
3,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"It's interesting. I haven't heard much about that, Glenn. So, we can look into it for you. But to be honest, the fact that I haven't heard much
makes me think that it's maybe not such a big driver right now .",2023,4
4,9,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Okay, cool. Thank you for that .",2023,4
0,10,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,Po rtales Partners LLC,"Thank you. I have a question about the role that First Republic plays in your NII forecast. I'm assuming, because you'll have  a full year in 2024
of First Republic that their contribution of NII will be up, let's say, from $3.7 billi on this year to $5 billion to $6 billion next year. But given that
you're forecasting six rate cuts, is that a detractor to your assumptions of NII from First Republic? Or – I mean, you have that FDIC note, and
then you also have a significant amount of ad justable rate mortgages that I assume are repricing upwards. So, if you're talking about rate cuts,
that would hurt your NII forecast from First Republic, I'm guessing. But if rates stay higher for longer, wouldn't First Repu blic be a much bigger
contribut or? So, talk about the sensitivities of First Republic there .",2023,4
1,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks, Charlie. So, one thing that we said when we kind of gave First Republic guidance at Investor Day earlier this y ear is that while
we understood the need to track that, and we've been splitting out First Republic in our reported results in orde r to improve period -on-period
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A
comparability, we kind of want to stay out of the business of guiding on First Republic. And so, we really focused on having our guidance be
Firmwide, including F irst Republic, now that everything is embedded in the franchise.
Having said that, let me just react to a couple of the things that you said. So, again, I don't want to get into like micro -validation one way or the
other of some of your back -of-the-envelo pe math. But we did have some accelerated pull to par on some of the accretion of some of the loans
that we purchased this year. So, I think the annualization that you're doing is maybe a bit high for the 2024 number. And the n, from a
sensitivities perspec tive, I actually think I can simplify the math for you a little bit and just kind of direct you to the EaR per my response to  the
prior question. Because that EaR fully includes all of the First Republic assets and liabilities with all of the various dyna mics. And so, I think
that's kind of like an easier way to think about it for the company .",2023,4
2,10,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,Portales Partners LLC,"Just to make sure I understood what you're saying, so you have NII ex. Markets going from $94 billion to $88 billion. Within that, would the
contribution from First Republic be down as well or up ?",2023,4
3,10,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"It's going to hit… the day we did it, so.. .",2023,4
4,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, I can probably answer that question if I think about it for a second, but it sort of violates my prior statemen t that I really don't
want to get into the business of guiding on First Republic. If I do the big picture, right, so big picture, 2023, we had eight months of First
Republic NII. 2024, we're going to have 12. So, all else equal, there's calendarization in there. What's also true is that in  2023, as a result of
the impact of the NII of the pull to p ar of certain relatively short -dated assets that we fair -valued at a meaningful discount as part of the
transaction, that sort of – that pull to par happens quite quickly, and therefore, probably juiced the 2023 number a little bit. So, therefore,
straight  annualization is probably not the right way to think about it. Then, you just get into the questions about the FTP and the fu nding and
whatever, and then this is like too complicated. So, I'd rather not go there .",2023,4

1,1,Jamie Dimon,"Cha irman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMo rgan Chase & Co.,Morning .,2024,1
2,1,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"So, a couple of questions here. Just, one, Jamie, could you talk through the decision to raise the dividend kind of mid -cycle, it felt like, pre -
CCA R? And also , help us understand how you're thinking about where that payout ratio, that dividend payout ratio , range should be. Because
over the past several years, it's been somewhere between 24% and 32%. And so, is this suggesting we could be towards the  higher -end of
that range or even expanding above that?
And then I also just wanted to understand the buyback and the keeping of the CET1 at 15% here. The minimum is 11.9%. I know i t's – we
have to wait for Basel III Endgame re -proposal to come through a nd all that , but should we be expecting that, hey, we're going to hold 15%
CET1 until we know all these rules? Thanks .",2024,1
3,1,Jamie Dimon,"Cha irman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMo rgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, Betsy, before I answer the question , I want to say something on behalf of all of us at JPMorgan and , me personally, thrilled to have
you on this call. For those that don't know, Betsy has been through a terrible medical episode  and it's a reminder to all of us how lucky we are
to be here. B ut, Betsy, in particular, the amount of respect we have , not just in your work , but in your character over the last 20  plus years has
been exceptional. So, on behalf of all of us, I just want to welcome you back and thrilled to have you here.
And so, you 're asking a  pertinent  question. So, we're earning a lot of money. Our capital cup runneth over, and that's why we've increased the
dividend. And if you're asking me what we'd like to do is to pay out something like a third, a third of normalized earnings.  Of course, it's hard to
calculate always what normalized earnings are, but we don't mind being a little bit ahead of that sometimes, a little bit beh ind that sometimes.
If I could give people kind of consistent dividend guidance, et cetera, I think the fa r more important question is the 15%. So, look at the 15% ,
I'm going to oversimplify it , that basically will prepare us for the total Basel Endgame today, roughly. The specifics don't matter that much.
Jamie Dimon
Cha irman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMo rgan Chase & Co.  A
Remember, we can do a lot of things to change that in the short -run or the long -run, but it looks like Basel III Endgame may not be the worst
case. It'll be something less than that. So, obviously, when and if that happens, it would free up a lot of capital, and I'm going to say in the
order of $20 billion or something like that .
And, yes, we've always had the capital hierarchy the same way, which is we're going to use capital to build our business firs t, I mean, pay the
dividend  – steady dividend, build the business, and if we think it's a ppropriate to buy back stock. We're continuing to buy back stock at $2
billion a quarter (sic) . I personally do not want to buy back a lot more than that at these current prices. I think you've all heard me talk about
the world, things like that. So, w aiting in preparation for Basel. Hopefully we'll know something later, and then we can be much more specific
with you all.
But in the meantime, there's also – it's very important to put in mind, there are short -term uses for capital that are good for shareholders, that
could reduce our CET1  too. So, you may see us do things in the short -run that will increase earnings, increase capital, that are using up that
capital. Jeremy mentioned on the – on one of the things that we know, the balance sheet and how we use the balance sheet for credit and
trading, we could do things now.
So, it's a great position to be in. We're going to be very, very patient. I urge all the analysts to keep in mind, excess cap ital is not wasted
capital, it's earnings in store. W e will deploy it in a very good way for shareholders in due course.",2024,1

8,1,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Okay. Thank you so much, and appreciate it. Looking forward to seeing you at Investor Day on May 20 th.",2024,1
9,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Excellent. Us too .,2024,1
0,2,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seapor t Global Securities LLC,"Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're s eeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter, if there's been any
change? Have you seen that migration start to slow or not ?",2024,1
1,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Good  question, Jim. I think the simplest and best answer to that is : not really. So, as we've been saying for a while, migration from
checking and savings to CDs is sort of the dominant trend with this driving the increase in weighted average rate paid in the  consumer deposit
franchise , that continues. We continue to capture that money -in-motion at a very high rate. We're very happy about what that means about the
consumer franchise and level of engagement that we're seeing.
I'm aware that there's a litt le bit of a narrative out there about are we seeing the end of what people sometimes refer to as cash sorting. We've
looked at that data. We see some evidence that maybe it's slowing a little bit. We're quite cautious on that. We really sort of don't think  it
makes sense to assume that in a world where checking and savings is paying effectively zero and the policy rate is above  5% that you're not
going to see ongoing migration.
And frankly, we expect to see that even in a world where – even if the current yield curve environment were to change and meaningful cuts
were to get reintroduced and we would actually start to see those, we would still expect to see ongoing migration and yield -seeking behavior.
So, it's quite conceivable and this is  actually on the yield curve that we had in fourth quarter that had six cuts in it. We were still nonetheless
expecting an increase in weighted average rate paid as that migration continues. So, I would say no meaningful change in the trends and the
expect ation for ongoing migration is very much still there .",2024,1
2,2,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seapor t Global Securities LLC,"Okay. And just a follow -up on that and just sort of bigger picture on NII. Is that sort of the biggest driver of your outlook? Is it migration? I s it
the forward curve? Is it balances? It sounds like it's migration, but just I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on the bigges t drivers of upside or
downside .",2024,1
3,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, I mean I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it
was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now. But the snap from quarter -end had  roughly three
cuts in it. So, it's the current yield curve, it's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset
from Card revolve growth, which while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is s till a tailwind there.
We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down, so that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then,  there's obviously
the wild card of potential product level reprice, which we always say we're going to mak e those decisions situationally as a function of
competitive conditions in the marketplace, and you know this obviously, but in a world where we've got something like $900 bi llion of deposits
paying effectively zero, relatively small changes in the product  level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So, the error  bands here are
pretty wide, and we're always going to stick with our mantra, which has been not losing primary bank relationships and thinki ng about the long -
term health of the franchise when we think about deposit pricing .",2024,1
4,2,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seapor t Global Securities LLC,Right. Okay. Great. Thanks for the color .,2024,1
5,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Thanks .,2024,1
0,3,John McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Thanks. Jeremy, you had mentioned at a conference earlier this year that the Street might need to build in more reserve growt h – for the Card
growth, you've had more reserve build. We didn't s ee that this quarter. Is that just kind of seasonal? And would you still expect the kind of
growth math to play out in terms of Card growth and reserve build needs ?",2024,1
1,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, John. So, in short,  yes to both questions. So, yes, the relative lack of build this quarter is a function of the normal seasonal patterns of
Card. Yes, we still expect 12% Card loan growth for the full year. And yes, that still means that all else equal, we think the conse nsus for the
allowance build for the back three quarters is still a little too low , if you map it to that expected Card loan growth.
Obviously, there's the wild card of what happens with our probabilities and our parameters and the output of our internal  process of assessing
the skew in the seasonal distribution and so on, and we're not speaking to that one way or the other. So, if guys have your o wn opinions about
that, that's fine, but we're narrowly just saying that based on the Card loan growth that we expect and normal coverage ratios for that, we do
expect build in the back half of the year .",2024,1
2,3,John McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Okay. Got it. And then just to follow up to make it super clear on the idea of the Markets  NII, that outlook  being revised down by $1 billion but
revenue  neutral. I guess, the obvious thing is, there, there's typically an offset in fee income and you don't guide to that. But the  idea would be
the way you're structuring trades, the way the ba lance sheet is evolving, there ’s some offset that you'd expect in Markets fees from the lower
Markets NII , correct ?",2024,1
3,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"That is exactly right. And specifically, what's going on here is there's shift between on -balance sheet and off -balance sheet in the financing
businesses and prime and so on within Markets. And you can actually see a little bit of a pop in the Markets balance sheet in  the supplement
and these things are all related. So,  fundamentally, you can think of it as like we either hold the equities on the balance sheet, non -interest -
bearing, high -funding expense, negative for NII, or we receive that in total return form through derivatives, exactly the same economics, n o
impact o n NII.
So, that shift is a function of the sort of borrowing relationships in the marketplace in ways that are bottom line effective ly neutral. It's second
order effects, but they change the geography quite a bit, and that's what happened this quarter. A nd that's why we've been emphasizing for
some time that the NII ex . Markets is the better number to focus on in terms of an indicator of how the core banking franchise is performing .",2024,1
4,3,John McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,Got it. Thank you.,2024,1
5,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Thank you .,2024,1
0,4,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Hey. Goo d morning. I guess, just in terms of, Jeremy, when you think about the outlook for the economy, I would appreciate your thoug hts on
the health of the customer base, both commercial and consumer. And when we think about higher -for-longer, maybe the economy is too
strong  so we don't get any rate cuts, are you seeing that when you talk to your customers and the feedback you're getting from your bankers
where the momentum is picking up?
And I appreciate all the macro risks that Jamie has pointed out, but I'm just getting – trying to get to a sense of what your view is in terms of
the most likely outcome based on what you're seeing today from the customers .",2024,1
1,4,Jamie Dimon,"Cha irman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMo rgan Chase & Co.,"I would sa y consumer customers are fine. The unemployment is very low. Home prices are up. Stock prices are up. The amount of income
they need to service their debt is still kind of low, but the extra money of the lower -income folks is running out – not running out , but
normaliz ing, and you see credit normalizing a little bit. And of course, higher -income folks still have more money, they're still spending it. So,
whatever happens, the customer is in pretty good shape and they're – if they – you go into a r ecession, they'll be in pretty good shape.
Businesses are in good shape. If you look at it today, their confidence is up, their order books are up, their profits are up . But what I caution
people, these are all the same results of a lot of fiscal spending , a lot of QE, et cetera. And so, we don't really know what's going to happen.
And I also want to look at the year. Look at two years or three years, all the geopolitical effects and oil and gas and how m uch fiscal spending
will actually take place, our el ections, et cetera.
So, we're in good shape – we're okay right now. It does not mean we're okay down the road. And if you look at any inflection point, being okay
in the current time is always true. That was true in 1972. It was true in any time we've had  it. So, I just – I'm just on the more cautious side.
How people feel and confidence levels and all that, that doesn't necessarily stop you from having an inflection point. And so , everything is
okay today, but you've got to be prepared for a range of outc omes, which we are.
And the other thing I want to point out, because all of these questions about interest rates and yield curves and NII and credit losses, it's – one
thing to project it today based on what – not what we think in economic scenarios, but the generally accepted economic scenario , which is the
generally accepted rate cuts of the Fed, but these numbers have always been wrong.
You have to ask the question, what if other things happen like higher rates with this modest recession, et cetera? Then all these  numbers
change. I just don't think any of us should be surprised if and when that happens. And I just think the chance of happeni ng is higher than other
people. I don't know the outcome. We don't want to guess the outcome. I've never seen anyone actually positively predict big inflection point in
the economy , literally in my life or in history .",2024,1
2,4,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"That's helpful. And just tied to that, as we look at commercial real estate both for J .P. and for the economy overall, is higher rates alone
enough to create more vulnerability than issues beyond office CRE? Like, how woul d you characterize the health of the CRE market? Thank
you.",2024,1
3,4,Jamie Dimon,"Cha irman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMo rgan Chase & Co .,"Yeah, so I'll put it into two buckets. Okay? First of all, we're fine. We've got good reserves against office. We think ou r multifamily is fine.
Jeremy can give you more detail on that if you want.
But if you think of real estate, there's two pieces. If rates go up, think of the yield curve. The whole yield curve, not Fed  funds, but the 10 -year
bond rate, it goes up 2%, all assets, all assets, every asset on the planet, including real estate, is worth 20% less. Well, obviously, that creates
a little bit of stress and strain, and people have to roll those over and finance it more. That's not just true for real esta te, it's tru e for everybody.
And that happens, leveraged loans, real estate will have some effect.
The second thing is the, why does that happen? If that happens because we have a strong economy, well, that's not so bad for real estate
because people will be hiring a nd throwing  things out and other financial assets. If that happens because we have stagflation, well that ’s the
Jamie Dimon
Cha irman & Chief Executive Officer, JPMo rgan Chase & Co . A
worst case. All of a sudden, you are going to have more vacancies, you are going to have more companies cutting back, you are going to
have less leases. It will affect – including multifamily, that will filter through the whole economy in a way that we – people haven't really
experienced since 2010.
So, I just put in the back of your mind the why is important, the interest r ates are important, the recession is important. If things stay where
they are today, we have kind of the soft landing that seems to be embedded in the marketplace, everyone will – the real estate will muddle
through. Obviously, it will be idiosyncratic if you're in different cities and different types and B versus A buildings and all of that, but people
muddle through. They won't muddle through under higher rates with the recession. That would be tough for a lot of folks and n ot just real
estate if, in fact , that happens .",2024,1
4,4,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,Helpful. Thank you so much .,2024,1
5,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Ebrahim .",2024,1
0,5,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS S ecurities LLC,"Hi. Good morning. Given that your response to Betsy's question is that 15% CET1 today prepares you for Basel III Endgame as w ritten, you
earn 22% on – without the FDIC assessment. Ahead of Investor Day, I guess, six weeks from now or a week from now, as we think about that
17% through -the-cycle target, if you're at the right capital level per you guys, where are you over -earning today ?",2024,1
1,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. So, interesting framing of the question, Erika. So, I think we've been pretty consistent about where we're over -earning, right? So,
obviously, one major area is that we're over -earning in deposit margin, especially in  consumer and that's sort of why we're expecting
sequential declines in NII, why we've talked about compressing deposit margins and increases in weighted average rate paid. S o, I think that's
probably the single biggest source of, let's call it, excess ear nings currently.
You also have heard Jamie say that we're over -earning in credit. I mean, Wholesale charge -offs have been particularly low, but we have
builds for that. So, in the current run rate, a bit less clear the extent of what we're earning. And i n Card, of course, while charge -offs are now
close to normalized essentially, we did go through an extended period of charge -offs being very low by historical standards, although that was
coupled with NII also being low by historical standards. So, from a bottom line perspective, it's not entirely clear what the net of that was. But
broadly, it's really deposit margin that's the biggest single factor in the over -earning narrative.
Embedded in your question, I think, is a little bit of the “what are you thin king about the 17% CET1 in light of the current level of capital ” and so
on and you did talk about Investor Day. I was hoping that we would have interesting things to say about that at Investor Day in ligh t of potential
updates of the Basel III Endgame , given that the single most important factor for that 17% is how much denominator expansion do we see
through the Basel III Endgame.
At the rate we're going, we won't actually know that much more about that by Investor Day, so we might not have that much  more to say
except to reiterate what I've said in the past which is that, whatever it is, it's going to be very good, our returns in abso lute terms, very good in
relative terms. We will optimize, we will seek to reprice, we will adjust in various ways to the best of our ability. But given the structure of the
rule as proposed at least, a lot of this cannot be optimized away. And so, in the base case you have to think of it as a headwi nd.",2024,1
2,5,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Got it. And just as a follow -up question, you mentioned that the current curve that you set your NII outlook upon is stale. I guess, does it matter
that – it seems like the market down  pricing, and obviously no June cut, no September cut a nd a toss -up in December , which should  matter for
this year. As we think about that $90 billion, if we price rate cut s out totally, does that matter much given it seems like June is the only one that
would...",2024,1
3,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Sorry, Erika. So, just quick things on this. One, let's focus on NII ex ., not on total NII. So, I'd anchor you to the $89 billion. Number two, if
you want to do math for like the changes of the average fund s rate for the rest of the year and multiply that times the EaR like, be my guest ,
it's like as good as an approach as any.
But I would just once again remind you of the $900 billion of deposits paying practically zero, that very small chang es there can make a big
difference. And we've got other factors. We've got the impact of QT on deposit balances, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So , we want to make
sure that we don't get too precise here. We're giving you our best guess based on a series  of assumptions and it's going to be where it's going
to be .",2024,1

0,6,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Thanks. Good morning. Jeremy, I was wondering if you could expand a little bit on one of your prepared comments. When you tal ked about,
we'll have hopes and expectations for the Investment Banking pipeline that continued to move along, we obviously saw the good movement in
ECM and DCM and the lag in Advisory. Can you just talk about that?
You mentioned like potential cautiousness around the election. Just what are you hearing from both the corporate side and the sponsor side
with – as it relates to M&A on like go -no-go type of feel and conversation levels? And then, what are you thinking we need to have to kickstart
just another good level of IPO activity in the ECM markets? Thanks .",2024,1
1,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Yeah. Let me take the IPO first. So, we have been a little bit cautious there. Some cohorts and vintages of IPOs had pe rformed
somewhat disappointingly. I think that narrative has changed t o a meaningful degree this quarter. So I think we're seeing better IPO
performance. Obviously, Equity Markets have been under a little bit of pressure last few days. But in general, we have a lot of support there
and that always helps.
Dialogue is quite g ood. A lot of interesting different types of conversations happening with global firms, multinationals, carve -out type things.
So, dialogue is good. Valuation  environment is better , like sort of decent reasons for optimism there. But of course, with ECM,  there's always a
pipeline dynamic and conditions were particularly  good this quarter. And so, we caution ed a little bit there about pull -forward . Which is even
more acute I think on the DCM side , given that quite a higher percentage of the total amount of debt that needed to be refinanced this year,
has gotten done in the first quarter. So, that's a factor.
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A
And then, the question of M&A I think is probably the single most important question, not only because of its impact on M&A, but also because
of it's knock -on impact on DCM through acquisition, financing and so on. And there is the well -known kind of regulatory headwinds there and
that's definitely having a bit of a chilling effect. I don't kn ow, I've heard some narratives that maybe there is like some pent -up deal demand.
Who knows how important politics are in all this? So, I don't know.
We're fundamentally, as I said, I think  on the press call, happy to see momentum this quarter . Happy t o see momentum in announced M&A. A
little bit cautious about the pull -forward dynamic . A little bit cautious about the regulatory headwinds. And in the end, we're just going to fight
really hard for our share of the wallet here .",2024,1
2,6,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Got it. And I guess, I'll just stick on the theme of capital markets, and not surprising at all to see a little bit tougher c omp in FIC C. I think you
guys have kind of indicated that maybe a flattish fee pool is a reasonable place , and I know that's impossible to guide on. But just, maybe talk
to some of the dynamics in terms of activity across the Fixed Income and Equities business. And do you feel like this is the type of
environment where, given that lingering uncertainty about rates, clients are either more engaged or less engaged in terms of how they're
positioning portfolios? Thanks .",2024,1
3,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Really good question. I would say, in general, that the sort of volatility and uncertainty in the rate environment overall on balance is
actually supportive for the Market s revenue pool. And I think that , together with generally more balance sheet deployment as well as sort of
some level of natural background  growth , is one of the reasons that the overall level of Markets revenue has stabilized at meaningfully above
what was normal in the pre -pandemic period.
And well, that does occasionally make us a little bit anxious like, “Oh, is this sustainable? Might  there be downside here? ” For now, that does
seem to be the new normal. And I do think that having rates off the lower zero bound and a sort of more normal dynamic and gl obal rates, that
not only affects the rates business, but it affects the Foreign Excha nge business. It generally just makes asset allocation decisions more
important and more interesting.
And so, all of that creates risk management needs and active managers need to grapple with it, and so on and so forth. So, I think that – those
are some of the themes on the Market side at the margin. And yeah, we'll see how the rest of the year goes. But it sort of seems to be
behaving relatively normally, I would sa y.",2024,1
0,7,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Hi. Jamie, I'm just trying to reconcile some of your concerns in your CEO letter. I'm sure the 60 pages  – I can see you put a lot of effort into
that, and it's appreciated. But you talked about scenarios, tail risk, macro risk, geopolitical risk and all that over several years, if not weeks or
months. I get it. On the other hand, the firm is investing so much more outside the U .S., whether it's commercial or some digital banking,
consumer or wholesale payments. So , I'm just trying to reconcile kind of your actions with your words.
And specifically, how is global Wholesale Payments going? You mentioned you're in 60 countries. You do business a lot more. How is that
business in parti cular doing? Thanks .",2024,1
1,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right, Mike. So I ’m sorry to tell you that Jamie actually left us because he ’s at a leadership off -site. That ’s why he was here remote. So, I think
he left the call in my hands , for better or for worse. But let me try to address some of your points and without sort of speaking for Jamie here.
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A
I think that when we talk about the impact of the geopolitical uncertainty on the outlook, part of the point there is to  note that the U .S. is not
isolated from that. If we have  global macroeconomic problems as a result of geopolitical situations, that ’s not only a problem outside of the
U.S.; that affects the global economy and therefore the US and therefore our corporate customers, et cetera, et cetera.
And in that context, keeping in mind what we always say that we invest through -the-cycle, that we sort of , we don’t  go into countries and then
leave countries, et cetera. Obviously, we adjust around the edges, we manage ri sks, we do make choices as a function of the overall
geopolitical environment. But broadly , the notion that we would pull back meaningfully from one of the key competitive strengths that this
company has always had which is, its sort of global  character because of a particular moment geopolitically, would just be inconsistent with
how we've always operated.
And in terms of the Wholesale Payments business, it's going great. We're taking share. There's been a lot of innovation there, a lot of
investment in technology, a lot of connectivity to payment systems in different countries around the world. And yeah, I'm sur e we'll give you
more color in other settings on that, but it's a good story. It's a nice thing to see .",2024,1

to supply chain changes, everything else? Why is Wholesale Payments doing great ?",2024,1
3,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Well, I think one of the things about Payments business es is that, in some sense they are – I mean, recession proof is probably the wrong
word; and in any case, we're not dealing with the rec ession . We're talking fundamentally about moving money through pipes around the world,
and that's a thing that people need to do more or less, no matter what. So, that's one piece.
But I think the other piece is that, our willingness to invest which has always been a focus of yours, is one of the key things separating us in
this business right now. And so, we are seeing the benefits of that .",2024,1

0,8,Glenn S chorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Thank you. Your commentary with Ken's questions were great and clear on Investment Banking for the near term in this year. I have a bigger
picture question in terms of, you're always so good in spelling out where you're over -earning. Do you feel like you 're under -earning on the
Investment Banking side? And I just use some of your own numbers from the past of like, the market has added like $40 trillion of equity
market cap and $40 trillion of fixed income market cap last 10 years, yet the wallet is like  20% plus below the 10 -year average. So, is there
just a bigger upside and it's just a matter of when, not if .",2024,1
1,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Glenn. In short, yes. I mean, I think we're not shy about saying that we'r e under -earning in Investment Banking right now. Clearly, we're
below cycle averages, as you point out. We've been talking about when do we get back to the pre -pandemic wallet? But as you know, I mean
on this point, what it was, like March 2020, right, w as the beginning of the pandemic. So, it's like four years ago at this point. So, there has
been GDP growth, especially in nominal terms during that period, and you would expect the wallet to growth with that.
So, I do think there's meaningful upside in t he Investment Banking fee wallet. As I've noted, there are some headwinds , I think particularly in
M&A. But over time, you would hope that the amount of M&A is a function of the underlying industrial logic rather than the re gulatory
environment. So , you could see some mean reversion there. And, yeah, so that's why we're sort of leaning in. We're engaging with clients.
We're making sure that we're appropriately resourced for a more robust level of the wallet and fighting for every dollar of s hare.",2024,1
2,8,Glenn S chorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Cool. Maybe one other follow -up. You're alway s investing. You clearly get paid in growth across the franchise as you do. But relative to a lot of

of environmen t would have J .P. Morgan pull back on this tremendous investment spending wave that you've been going through ?",2024,1
3,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. So, I think the first thing to say which is somewhat obvious but I'm going to say it anyway is that, there are some like auto -governors in
this, right? Like some portion of the expense base is directly related to revenue, whether it's volume -related commissions, whether it's
incentive compensation, whether it's other thing s. So, there are some auto -correcting elements of the expense base that would happen
automatically as part of the normal discipline. So, that's point one.
Point two is that, independently of the environment, we are always looking for efficiencies. It's a little bit hard to see it, and in a world where
we're guiding to, I guess, now with the special assessment  added , $91 billion of expenses , it's hard to tell a story about all the efficiencies that
have been generated underneath. But that is part of the DNA of the company, that does happen in BAU all the time as we grind things out, get
the benefits of scale and try to extract that efficiency.
And I think to get to the heart of your question which is, okay, in what type of an environment would we mak e different strategic questions?
And in the end, I think that's a little bit about what that environment is really like. So, if you talk about like a normal r ecession,  with visibility on
the cycle, would we change our long -term strategic investment plans w hich are always built up from a financial modeling perspective
assuming resilience through -the-cycle? No, we wouldn't.
Could there be some environments that for whatever reason change the business case for certain investments , or even certain businesses ,
that lead us to make meaningfully different strategic choices? Yes, but that would be because the through -the-cycle analysis has changed for
some reason. I just don't see us fundamentally making strategically different decisions if the strategic outlook is  unchanged, simply because of
the business cycle in the short -term.",2024,1
4,8,Glenn S chorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,Awesome. Thank you .,2024,1
5,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Thanks .,2024,1
0,9,Matt O’Connor,Analyst,I nc.,"Good morning. You mentioned one use of capital is to lean into the trading businesses with your balance sheet. And we just se e the trading
assets going up Q2, which is probably seasonal, but also up a lot year -over-year, but not necessarily translate into higher revenues. And I
know they don't like match up necessarily each quarter, but maybe just elaborate like how you're leaning into the trad ing with the balance
sheet and how you expect that to benefit you over time .",2024,1
1,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, sure. So, let me break this question down into a couple of different parts. So, I think what Jamie was sort of suggesting is that, you can
think of the concept as kind of like strategic capital versus tactical capital for lack of a better term. And what he's kind of saying is that, in a
moment where you're carrying a lot of excess capital sort of for strate gic reasons, you have the ability at least in theory to deploy portions of
that with kind of like – into relatively short -duration assets or strategies or client opportunities in whatever moment for whatever reason, and
what might be thought of as a tactic al sense.
So, he's just pointing out that that's an option that you have. And the extent to which this quarter's increase in Markets RW A is a reflection of
that, maybe a little bit, but probably not. I agree with you that it's hard in any given quarter to specifically link the change in capital and RWA to
a change in revenue versus too many moving parts there.
But for sure, one thing that's true is the higher run rate of the Markets businesses as a whole that we talked about a second  ago, is lin ked also
to higher deployment of balance sheet into those businesses. So, as you well know, we pride ourselves on being extremely anal ytical and
extremely disciplined in how we analyze capital liquidity, balance sheet deployment, G SIB capacity utilization , et cetera, in the Markets
business. And we don't just chase revenue; we go after returns fully measured. And that's part of the DNA, and we continue to  do it and we
will.
So – that we still are operating under multiple binding constraints. And obviousl y, the environment is complex, so the ability to sort of throw a
ton of capital at opportunities is not quite that simple always. But big picture, we are clearly in a very, very strong capit al position which is, in
no small part in anticipation of all the uncertainty, but it does also mean that if opportunities arise between now and when the Basel III
Endgame is final, we are very well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities .",2024,1
2,9,Matt O’Connor,Analyst,I nc.,"Got it. An d then just separately, within the Consumer Card businesses, you highlighted volumes were up 9% year -over-year. Obviously, still a
very strong piece. Any trends within that that are worth noting in terms of changes in spend category ? Either overall or amo ng certain
segments? Thank you .",2024,1
3,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Maybe a little bit. Jamie already alluded somewhat to this. So, I do think spend is fine but not boomy, broadly speaking, I w ould say. You can
look at it a lot of different ways: inflation, cohorts, et cetera. But when you kind of triangulate that, you get  back to this kind of flattish picture.
There is a little bit of evidence of substituting out of discretionary into nondiscretionary.
And I think the single most notable thing is just this effect, where in the – while it is true that real incomes have gon e up in the lowest income
cohorts, within that there's obviously a probability distribution. And there's some – or rather just a distribution of outcomes. And there are some
set of people whose real incomes are not up, they're down, and who are therefore s truggling a little bit unfortunately. And what you observe in
the spending patterns of those people is, some meaningful slowing rather than what you might have feared which is sort of agg ressive levering
up.
So, I think that's maybe an economic indicator of sorts, although this portion of the population is small enough that I'm not sure the reader cost
is that big. But it is encouraging from a credit perspective because it just means that people are behaving kind of rationall y and in a sort of
normal post -pandemic type of way as they manage their own balance sheets, and that's sort of the margin good news from a credit
perspective .",2024,1

0,10,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Hi, Jeremy .",2024,1
1,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hey, Gerard. How are you doing ?",2024,1
2,10,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Good. Thanks. Notwithstanding your guys' outlook for uncertainty, and of course Jamie talked about it in his shareholder letter and addressed
it also on this call when he was here earlier. Can you guys share or can you share with us the color on what's going on in th e corporate
lending market in terms of spreads seem to be getting tighter ? It's not reflecting, I don't think, a real fear out there in the global geopolitical
world. And any color just on what you guys are seeing in the leveraged loan market as well ?",2024,1
3,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. So, I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the
leverage lending space, is that they are exceptionally tight. So, I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days.  But bro adly throughout
the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, wh ere losses in OCI that
we would've had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in  the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with
the big run -up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary
markets.
That, I think, has manifested itself a little bi t in the leverage lending space in the normal way that it does, and that there's a lot of competition
among providers for the revenue pool, and you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms which always makes us a little bit concerned. And
as we have  in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromis e on
structure there. So, you are seeing a little bit of that.
I think that, away from the leverage lending space in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I thin k, in no small
part, as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disc iplining a little bit their lending, you're
seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived ove r the last few weeks,
and  it was little bit hard to observe in any case .
But I would say broadly, the dynamics are the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the f act that overall
asset prices and conditions are quite supportive and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot .",2024,1
4,10,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Thank you. And I guess, as a tie -in to that question  and answer, we've read and seen so much about the private credit growth in this country
by private credit companies. Can you give us some color on what yo u're seeing there, both as a competitor , but also as a client of JPMorgan?
How you balance the two out, where you may see them bidding on business that you'd like but at the same time you're supportin g their
business?",2024,1
5,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. Yeah. I mean, I think that tension between us as a provider of secured financing to some portions of the private credi t, private equity
community, you're talking about different parts of the capital structu re. But we do recognize that we compete in some areas and we are clients
of each other in other areas, and that's part of the franchise and it's all good at some level.
But narrowly, on private credit, it is interesting to observe what's going on there. S o I would say, for us, the strategy there is very much to be
product agnostic actually. It's not so much like, oh, is it private credit or is it syndicated lending? It's, what does it take to be good at this stuff?
And what it takes is, stuff that we h ave and have always had and that we're very good at in each individual silo . So, you need underwriting
skill, structuring skill, origination, distribution, secondary trading, risk appetite, credit analysis capabilities. And this  is what we do and we're
really good at it.
And increasingly, what you see actually is that, as you see us doing a little bit, as the private credit space gets bigger, i t starts to make sense
to actually bring in some co -lenders so that you can sort of do big enough deals without having undue concentration risks. I mean, even if you
have the capital, you just may not want the concentration risk.
And so, in a funny way, the private credit space becomes a little bit more like the syndicated lending space. And at the same  time, the
syndicated lending space being influenced a little bit by these private credit uni tranche structures, gets pushed a little bit in the private credit
direction in terms of like speed of execution and other aspects of how that business works. So, we'r e watching it. The competitive dynamics
are interesting. Certainly, there's some pressure in some areas. But we really do think that our overall value proposition an d competitive
position here is second to none, and so we're looking forward to the future h ere.",2024,1

0,11,Charles W. Peabo dy,Analyst,Portales Partners LLC,"Good morning. A couple of questions on the First Republic acquisition. Some of us obviously thought that would be a homerun, and I'm glad to
see that Jamie Di mon validated that in his annual letter. When you look at the first quarter, it annualizes out to $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion,  above
the $2 billion that Jamie published in the letter. I know you don't want to extrapolate that.
But can you remind us what so rt of cost savings you still have in that, because this quarter did see expenses come down to $800 million down
from $900 million? And then, secondly, is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less and that's why yo u don't want to
extrapolate the $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion? So, that's my first question .",2024,1
1,11,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Okay. Thanks, Charlie. And I'm going to do my best to answer your question, while sticking to my sort of guns  on not giving too much First
Republic  specific guidance. But I do think that the kind of framework you're articulating is broadly correct. So, let me go through th e pieces.
So yes, the current quarter's results annualized to more than the $2 billion Jamie talked about. Yes, a big part of that reason is discount
accretion which was very frontloaded as a result of short -dated assets. So, that's part of the reason that you see that converge. Yes, it's also
true that we expect the expense run rate  to decline later in the year as we continue making progress on integration. Obviously, as I think as I
mentioned to you last quarter, from a full year perspective you just have the offset of the full year calendarization effect.
There's maybe an embedded  question in there, too, about we had talked about $2.5 billion of integration expense. And the integration is real,
the expenses are real, and also the time spent on that is quite real. It's a lot of work for a lot of people. It's going well , but we're no t done yet;
and it takes a lot of effort. But broadly, I think that our expectations for integration expense are probably coming in a bit  lower than we
originally assumed on the morning of the deal, for a couple of reasons.
One is that the framework aroun d the time was understandably quite conservative and sort of assumes that we would kind of lose a
meaningful portion of the franchise, and would sort of need to size the expense base accordingly. And of course, it's worked out, to your poin t,
quite a bit better than that. And therefore, the amount of expenses that is necessary to keep this bigger franchise is higher . And that means,
less integration expense associated with taking down those numbers.
It's probably also true that the integrat ion assumptions were conservative. They were based on kind of more typical type of bank M&A
assumptions as opposed to the particular nature of this deal including the FDIC and so on and so forth. So, yeah, I think tha t probably is a
pretty complete answer to your question. Thanks, Charlie .",2024,1
2,11,Charles W. Peabo dy,Analyst,Portales Partners LLC,"As a quick follow -up. Where are the next homeruns going to come from? And this is more strategic beyond just JPMorgan, but there are
probably going to be more regional bank failures, whether it's this year or next year, and opportunities to pick those up. But what you're seei ng
is that, private equity and family offices are setting up to participate in this next round of bank failures. Mnuchin's buyin g of NYCB is clearly to
create a platform for rollups of failed banks, and then there are other family offices that have filed shelf registrations fo r bank holding
companies whose specific purpose is to buy failed banks.
So, do you think that these opportuni ties are going to be competed away by private credit? And as part of that, do you think the regulators are
going to view private credit as a different party and less attractive party versus bank takeovers of failed banks? So, that's  my question .",2024,1
3,11,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. Okay, Charlie. There's a lot in there. And to be honest, I just don't love the idea of spending a lot of time on this call speculating about
bank failures. You obviously have a particular view about the next wave in the landscape. I'm not going to bother debating that with you. But I
guess, let me just try to say a couple of things, doing my best to answer your question.
As we talked about earlier, we have a lot of capital. And as Jamie says, the capital is earnings in store, and right now we don't see a lot of
really compelling opportunities to deploy the capital. But if opportunities arise despite the uncertainty about the Basel III  Endgame, we will be
well positioned to deploy it. I think embedded there is also sort of a question about the FDIC and the FDIC's attitude towards dif ferent types of
bidders, and obviously there's a lot of thinking and analysis happening about the entire process and some recent fo rums and speeches on
bank resolution and so on and so forth.
And I think probably we can all agree that it's better, all else equal for the system, to have as much capital available and as many different
types of capital available to ensure that things ar e stabilized if anything ever goes wrong. But the mechanics of how you do that when you're
talking about banks are not trivial and not to be underestimated. So I guess, that's probably as much as I have on that .",2024,1

1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Good morning, Steve.",2024,2
2,1,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"So, wanted to start off with a question on capital just given some indications that the Fed is considering favorable revision s to both Basel III
Endgame and the GSIB surcharge calculations, which I know you've been pushing for some time. As you evaluate just different capital
scenarios, are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized ROTCE at the Firm versus the 17% target? And
if so, just how that might impact or inf orm your appetite for buybacks going forward?",2024,2
3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. Okay. Thanks, Steve. And actually, before answering the question, I just want to remind everyone that Jamie is not abl e to join because
he has a travel conflict overseas, so it's just going to be me today.
Okay. Good question on the capital and the ROTCE. So, let me start with the ROTCE point first. In short, my answer to that qu estion would be
no. It's hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an  upward revision on ROTCE.
If you think about the way we've been talking about this, we've said that before the Basel III Endgame proposal, we had a 17%  through the
cycle target, and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes, the vast majori ty of them involve expansions of the denominator.
And while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing, all of which are still sort of in effect, most of those wo uld be thought of as
mitigants rather than things that would actually, like incre ase the ROTCE. And I don't really think that answer has particularly changed.
So, as of now, that's what I would say, which is a good pivot to the next point, which is, yeah, we've been reading the same press coverage
you've been reading and it's fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here. But in reality, we don't know anything you
don't know. We don't know how reliable the press coverage is. And so, in that sense, I feel like on the overall capital retur n and buyback
trajectory, no t much has actually changed relative to what I laid out at Investor Day, the comments that I made then, the comments that Jam ie
made then, as well as the comments that Jamie made the subsequent week at an industry conference.
So, maybe I'll just briefly s ummarize for everyone's benefit what we think that is, which is, one, we do recognize that our current practice on
capital return and buybacks does lead to an ever -expanding CET1 ratio. But obviously, we're going to run the company over the cycle over
time at a reasonable CET1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement. So, after all the uncertainty is sorted out, the question of
the deployment of the capital, one way or another, is a matter of when, not if.
On the capital hierarchy, it's al so worth noting that's another thing that remains unchanged, so I'll review it quickly. Growing the business
organically and inorganically, sustainable dividend, and in that context it's worth noting that the board's announced intenti on to increase it to
$1.25 is a 19% increase prior to last year. So, that's a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital.
And then, finally buybacks. But that hierarchy does not commit us to return 100% of the capital generation in any given quart er. And so, as we
sit here today, when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportuni ties to deploy the
capital outside the Firm, it's kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience. So, given all
that, putting it all together, and sorry for the long answer, we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital . And as Jamie has
said, we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else.",2024,2
4,1,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"No need to apologize, Jeremy. That was a really helpful  perspective. Maybe just for my follow -up on NII, you've been very consistent just in
flagging the risk related to NII overearning, especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwin ds. In the second
quarter, we did see at leas t some moderation in repricing pressures, deposit balances were also more resilient in with a seasonally weak
Steven Chubak
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q
quarter for deposit growth. So, just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating, do you see the pote ntial for NII
normali zing higher? And where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization?",2024,2
5,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressu res are slightly
abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, QT is still a bit of a headwind, loan grow th is modest and not enough to
offset that. And our PE seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it migh t not go down that
much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves  into the system. But on balance net across all those
various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So, when we think of our balance outlook, w e see it as flat to
slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and gro wth ambitions offsetting those system -wide headwinds.
So, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what, but I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the
overearning narrative or the normalization narrati ve. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the
year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So, two cuts versus six cuts is the  main difference
there. But obvious ly, based on the latest inflation data and so on, you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield
curve. So, we'll see how it goes and in the end, we're kind of focused on, on just running the place, recognizing, and trying  not to be distracted
by what remains some amount of overearning, whatever it is.",2024,2
6,1,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Understood, Jeremy. Thanks so much for taking my questions.",2024,2
7,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Steve.",2024,2
0,2,Saul Martinez,Analyst,Inc,"Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Jeremy, can you give an update on the stress capital buffer? You noted obviously that you
think there is an error in the Fed's calculation due to OCI. Can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the Fed l ooks like? Is there a
process to modify the SCB higher and if you could give us a sens e of what that process looks like?",2024,2
1,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, I'm not going to comment about any conversations with the Fed – not to confirm or deny that they even exist. That stuff is private.
And so, then if you talk about, like the timing here, right, so you know that the stress capital buffer that's bee n released at 3.3% is a preliminary
number. By rule, the Fed has to release that by August 31. It may come sooner. You talked about an error in the calculation. We haven't used
that word. What we know, what we believe rather is that the amount of OCI gain that came through the Fed's disclosed results looked non -
intuitively high to us. And if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable, you would get a slightly higher stress c apital buffer. Whether
the Fed agrees and whether they decide to make that  change or not is up to them, and we'll see what happens.
I think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro forma’d SCB,
whatever it might suitably be, you actually see once ag ain quite a bit of volatility in the year -on-year change in the stress capital buffer for
many firms. And just sort of reiterating and another example of what we've said a lot over the years that it's volatile, it's  untransparent, it makes
it very hard to manage capital of a bank. It leads to excessively high management buffers, and we think it's really not a great way to do thi ngs.
So, I'll leave it at that.",2024,2
2,2,Saul Martinez,Analyst,Inc,"Okay, got it. That's helpful. Just following up on capital returns on Steve's question, I think you highlighted in response it's a matter of when,
not if, and obviously, Jamie’s not there, you can’t speak for Jamie, but seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special  dividend or
buybac ks at current valuations. Can you just give us a sense of how you’re thinking about the various options? Any updated thoughts  on a
special dividend? And can you do other things like, for example, have a material increase in your dividend payout, sort of a step function
increase, where keep that flat and grow into that, grow your earnings into that over time? Can you just maybe give us a sense  of how you're
thinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital?",2024,2
3,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Yeah. I mean, I would direct you to read, I'm sure you have, Jamie's comments at the industry conference, where he part icipated the
week after Investor Day because he went into just good amount of detail on this stuff, addressing some of these points. And I think this
comment there about the special dividend was that it's not really our preference. We hear from people that many of our invest ors wouldn't find
that particularly appealing, and he said as much that it wouldn't be sort of our f irst choice.
So, I think the larger point is just that, a little bit to your question, there are a number of tools in the toolkit and they 're really the same tools that
are part of our capital hierarchy. So, first and foremost, we're looking to deploy the  capital into organic or inorganic growth. And then, the
dividend, I think we're always going to want to keep it in that sort of, like sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment so that
continues to be the way we think about that. And then,  at the end of it, it's buybacks and Jamie's been on the record for over a decade, I think,
over many shareholder letters, talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation and price is a factor. So, that's sort of the
totality of the set of options, I guess.",2024,2

0,3,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Thanks a lot. Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy, great to see the progress on Investment Banking fees up sequentially and 50% year -over-year,
and I saw you on the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space and we clearly didn't see the debt
pull-forward play through because your DCM was great again. I'm just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the
potential and just w here the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of, like how does this feel in terms of a current
environment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead. Thanks.",2024,2
1,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks, Ken. It's p rogress, right? I mean, we're happy to see the progress. People have been talking about depressed banking fee
wallet for some time and it's nice to see not only the year -on-year pop from a low base, but also a nice sequential improvement. So, that's the
first thing to say.
In terms of dialog and engagement, it's definitely elevated . So, the dialog on ECM is elevated, and the dialog on M&A is quite robust as well.
So, all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this  space. But there
are some important caveats. S o, on the DCM side, yeah, we made pull -forward comments in the first quarter, but we still feel that this second
quarter still reflects a bunch of pull -forward and therefore, we're reasonably cautious about the second half of the year. Importantly, a lot o f the
activity is refinancing activity as opposed to, for example, acquisition finance. So, the fact that M&A remains still relativ ely muted in terms of
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A
actual deals has knock -on effects on DCM as well. And when a higher percentage of the wallet is refied,  then the pull -forward risk becomes a
little bit higher.
On ECM, if you look at it kind of at a remove, you might ask the question, given the performance of the overall indices, you would think it
would be a really booming environment for IPOs for example . And while it's improving, it's not quite as good as you would otherwise expect,
and that's driven by a variety of factors, including the fact that, as has been widely discussed, the extent to which the per formance of the large
indices is driven by, like a few stocks, the sort of mid -cap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving IPOs have had
much more muted performance.
Also, a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple years ago was raised at pretty high valuations. And  so, in some cases, people looking
at IPOs could be looking at down -rounds, that's an issue. And while secondary market performance of IPOs has improved meaningfully, in
some cases people still have concerns about that. So, those are a little bit of overha ng on that space. I think we can hope that over time that
fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust. And, yeah, on the advisory side, the regulatory overhang is there, remains t here, and so,
we'll just have to see how that plays out.",2024,2
2,3,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,"Great. T hank you for all that, Jeremy. And just one on the Consumer side, just anything you're noticing in terms of people just have been
waiting for this delinquency stabilization on the Credit Card side. Obviously, your loss rates are coming in as you expected,  and we did see 30
days pretty flat and 90 days come down a little bit. Is that seasonal? Is it just a good rate of change trend? Any thoughts t here? Thanks.",2024,2
3,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I still feel like when it comes to Card charge -offs and delinquencies, there's just not much to see there. It's still – it's normalization, not
deterioration. It's in line with expectations. As I say, we alw ays look quite closely inside the cohort, inside the income cohorts. And when you
look in there, specifically, for example, on spend patterns, you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior that's consiste nt with a little bit of
weakness in the lower inc ome segments where you see a little bit of rotation on the spend out of discretionary into non -discretionary.
But the effects are really quite subtle and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment t hat we're seeing,
which while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions,  say, like
they've been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever, you are seeing slightly higher unemployment, you are seein g moderating GDP
growth. And so, it's not entirely surprising that you're seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend. So, it all k ind of hangs together
in what is in some sense actually not a very interesting story.",2024,2

0,4,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Hi, thanks very much. So, Jeremy, the discussions so far around private credit and you all, your recent comments have been th e ability to add
on balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front. And I do think that most of the discussion has been
about the direct lending component. So, I'm curious if you're showing more progress and activity on that front. And then, ver y importantly, do
Glenn Schorr
Analyst, Evercore ISI  Q
you see the same  trend happening on the asset -backed finance side because that's a bigger part of the world and it's a bigger part of your
business? So, I'd appreciate your thoughts there. Thanks.",2024,2
1,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Thanks, Glenn. So, on private credit, so nothing really new to say there. I think, I guess, one way the environment's e volving a little bit
is, as you know, a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals. And sort of a littl e bit to my prior comment, in a
relatively muted acquisition finance environment, at this point you've got a lot of money chasing, like not that many deals. So, the space is a
little bit quieter than it was at the margin.
Another interesting thing to note  is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged
finance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you  probably need
some of t hose protections in some cases, which is sort of supportive of the theme that we've been talking about, about convergence bet ween
the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space, which is kind of our core thesis here, which is that we can offer best-in-class
service across the entire continuum, including secondary market trading and so on. So, we feel optimistic about our offering there. I think the
current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was. So, it's maybe not a great moment to , like kind of test whether we're doing a lot
more or less in the space, so to speak.
And then, on asset -backed financing, you actually asked me that question before, and at the time, my answer was that I hadn't heard much
about that trend and that contin ues to be the case. But clearly, there must be something I'm missing. So, I can follow up on that and maybe we
can have a chat about it.",2024,2
2,4,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercor e ISI,"No. That's great for you if you're not hearing much about it, so we can leave it at that. Maybe just one quick follow -up in terms of your just
overall posturing. You were patient and smart when rates were low, waited to deploy, worked out great, w e know that story. Now, it seems like
you have tons of excess liquidity and you're being patient and rates are high, and I'm curious on how you think about what ki nd of triggers,
what kind of things you're looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration.",2024,2
3,4,Jeremy  Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. I mean, on duration, in truth, we have actually added  a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters. So, that's one thing to say.
That was more last quarter than this quarter. But, I guess, I would just caution you from a little bit away from looking at k ind of our reported
cash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that, when you look at the duration concept holistically, that there is a lot to be done
differently on the duration front. So, clearly, it's true that empirically we behaved, like very asset -sensitively in this rate hiking cyc le and that
has resulted in a lot of excess NII generation sort of on the way up in the near term.
But when we look at the Firm's overall sensitivity to rates, we look at it through both, like the EaR -type lens, a short -term NII sensitivity, but
also a va riety of other lenses, including various types of scenario analysis, including impacts on capital and higher rates. And as I think Jamie
has said a couple times, we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front. Also, given, like the inverted yield curve, it's not as if extending
duration from these levels means that you're locking in 5.5% rates. In fact, the forwards are not sort of that compelling giv en our views about
some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on. So, I think whe n you put that all together, I don't think that kind of a big
change in duration posture is a thing that's front of line for us.",2024,2
4,4,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,Super helpful. Thanks so much for that.,2024,2
5,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Glenn.",2024,2
0,5,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Good morning. I was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the ROTCE being too high at 20% and mo re
normalized at 17%. Obviously, you've pointed to overearning on NII. And I guess, the question is, is that all of it to go from 20% to 17%? And i f
so, is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us?",2024,2
1,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Good question, Matt. I mean, I guess, the way I think about it is a couple of things, like our returns tend to be a bit  seasonal, right? So, if
you kind of build yourself out a full -year forecast and make reasonable,  just based on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you
think about fourth quarter, like better look at this on a full -year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you
obviously have to strip out kind of the one -time items. And so, if you do that, like whatever you get for this year, is still clearly a number that's
higher than the 17%. So, yeah, one source of headwinds is normalization of the NII, primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs.
That's – we've talked about that. Part of it is also the yield curve effects. Some cuts will come into the curve at some point.
And in the normal course, if you kind of do a very, very, very simple mental model of the company, you would have, like reven ues growing at
some organic GDP, like rate maybe higher, and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead
ratio. But even if the amount of NII normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior poi nt, you still have some
background – you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen. So, as much as our discipline on expense
management is as tight as it always has been there, inflation is still non -zero. There are still inv estments that we're executing. There's still
higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of, in part, the normalization of NII.
And then, the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on Basel III Endgame and all the other pieces, you have to assume some
amount of expansion of the denominator, at least based on what we know so far. So, of course, any of those pieces could be wr ong, but that's
kind of how we get to our 17%. And if you look at the various scenari os that we showed on the last page of my Investor Day presentation, it
illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and othe r factors.",2024,2
2,5,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Yeah, that was a really helpful chart. Just the one follow -up, on the yield curve effects, I guess, what do you mean by that because right now
the yield curve is inverted, maybe you're still breathing in the impact of that. But kind of longer term, you'd e xpect little bit of steepness of the
curve, which I would think would help. But what did you mean by that? Thank you.",2024,2
3,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, you and I have talked about this before, I guess. I sort of – I guess, I don't really agree fundamentally with the notion that the
way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond what's priced in by the forewords is a sourc e of structural NII
or NIM for banks, if you know what I mean. Like, I mean, pe ople have different views about the so -called term premium and obviously, in a
moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics, people's thinking on that may be changing.
But I think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10 -year note was below 2%, everyone sort of – many people were kind of tempted to try to
get extra NIM, extra NII by extending duration a lot. But when the steepness of the curve implies, it is driven by the expect ation of actually
aggressive Fed tightening, it's just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from a capital and other perspectives, so.
There're some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the  road and
whether that c ould be sort of earning the term premium, so to speak, could be a source of NII. But that feels a bit speculative to me at th is
point.",2024,2
4,5,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,Got it. Okay. Thank you for the details.,2024,2
5,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Matt.",2024,2
0,6,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Hi. Jeremy, you said it's too early to end the overearning narrative and you highlighted higher deposit costs and the impact of lower rates and
lower NII and DCM pull-forward and credit costs going higher. Anything I'm missing in that list? And what would cause you to end the
overearning narrative?",2024,2
1,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"No. Actually, I think that is the right list, Mike. I mean, frankly, I think one thi ng that would end the overearning narrative is if our annual returns
were closer to 17%. I mean, to the extent that that is the through the cycle number that we believe and that we're currently producing more
than that, that's one very simple way to look a t that. But the pieces of that are the pieces that you talked about and the single most important
piece is the deposit margin. Our deposit margins are well above historical norms, and that is a big part of the reason that w e still are
emphasizing the overe arning narrative.",2024,2
2,6,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Your 17% through the cycle ROTCE expectation, what is the CET1 ratio that you assume for that?",2024,2
3,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I mean, we would generally assume requirements plus a reasonable buffer, which, depending on the shape of rules, could be a l ittle bit
smaller or a little bit bigger and no small part is a function of the volatility of tho se rules, which goes back to my prior comments on SCB and
CCAR. But obviously, as you well know, what actually matters is less the ratio and more the dollars and at this point, the do llars are very much
a function of where rules land and where the RWA land s and obviously, things like GSIB recalibration and so on. So, we've done a bunch of
scenario analysis along the lines of what I did at Investor Day that informs those numbers. But that is obviously one big ele ment of uncertainty
behind that 17%, which is why at Investor Day when we talked about it, both Daniel and I were quite specific about saying that we thought
17% was still achievable, assuming a reasonable outcome on the Basel III Endgame.",2024,2
4,6,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Let me just zoom out for one more question on the return target. I mean, when I asked Jamie at the 2013 Investor Day, would it make sense to
have 13.5% capital, he was basically telling me to take a hike, right? And now, you have 15.3% capital and you're saying, wel l, we might want
to have  a lot more capital here. I mean, at some point, if you're spending $17 billion a year to improve the company, if you're gaini ng share
with digital banking, if you're automating the back office, if you're moving ahead with AI, if you're doing all these thi ngs that I think you say
others aren't doing, why wouldn't those returns go higher over time or do you just assume you'll be competing those benefits away? Thanks.",2024,2
5,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, I think in short, Mike, and we've talked abo ut this a lot and Jamie's talked about this a lot, it's a very, very, very competitive
market, and we're very happy with our performance. We're very happy with the share we've taken, and 17% is like an amazing nu mber
actually. And like, to be able to do th at, given how robust the competition is from banks, from non -banks, from U.S. banks, from foreign banks,
and all of the different businesses that we compete in, is something that we're really proud of. So, the number has a range a round it,
obviously. So, i t's not a promise, it's not a guarantee, and it can fluctuate. But we're very proud to be in the ballpark of being able to th ink that
Jeremy Barnum

we can deliver it, again, assuming a reasonable outcome on Basel III Endgame. But it's a very, very, very competitive mark et across all of our
products and services and regions and client segments.",2024,2

0,7,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jeremy.",2024,2
1,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hi, Betsy.",2024,2
2,7,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Mor gan Stanley & Co. LLC,"So, I did want to ask one drill -down question on 2Q, and it's related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do. I think in the press
release, right, in the slide deck, it's $4.9 billion common stock net repurchases. So, the  question here is, what's the governor for you on how
much to do every quarter? And, I mean, I understand it's a function of, okay, how much do we organically grow. But even with that, so you get
the organic growth, which you had some nice movement there. But you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we
want to buy back our earnings or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time ? And I
remember over at Investor Day the whole debate arou nd I don't want to buy back my stock, but we are, right? So, I get this question from
investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here.",2024,2
3,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. That's a very good and fair question, Betsy. So, let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability. So, in no particula r order, one thing that
we've really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings, including in our recent 10 -Qs actually i s that we don't want to get into the
business of guiding on buybacks. So, we're going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve
the right to sort of change that at any time. So, I recognize that not everyone lov es that, but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so, I might
as well say it explicitly. It was pretty clear in the Q also, but I'm just going to say that again. So, that's point one.
But having said that, let me nonetheless try to address your poin t on framework and governors. So, generally speaking, we think it doesn't
make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now, let's say . Obviously, when
for whatever reason, if we ever need to  build capital in a hurry, we've done it before and we're always comfortable suspending buybacks
entirely. But I think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when you're generating your kind of capital.  And so, we were
talking before ab out this $2 billion pace. We're kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace, but that's where that idea comes from ,
let's put it that way.
You talked about the $4.9 billion, which I recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number. But w here that actually comes from is the
other statement that we've made that we have these significant item gains from Visa. And if you think about what that means, it means that we
have, post the acceptance of the exchange offer, a meaningful long position a nd a liquid large cap financial stock, i.e., Visa, which realistically
is highly correlated to our own stock. And so, in some sense, why carry that instead of just buying back JPMorgan stock. So, we talked about
– Jamie talked about, as we liquidate the Vi sa, deploying those proceeds into JPM and that’s what we did this quarter. So, that is why the $4.9
billion is a little higher, and it’s consistent with my comments at Investor Day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks.
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A
And beyond that, what you’re left with is my answer to Steve’s question, which is that, to your point about buying back earnings or whatever,
when we’re generating these types of earnings and there’s this much organic capital being generated in the absence of opportu nities  to deploy
it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy, but sustainable dividend, if we don’t return th e capital we are going
to keep growing the CET1 ratio to levels, which, if you think about the long strategic outlook of  the company, are not reasonable. They’re just
artificially high and unnecessary. So, one way or the other, that will need to be addressed at some point. It’s just that we don’t feel that now is
the right time.",2024,2
4,7,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"All right. Thank you, Jeremy. Appreciate it.",2024,2

1,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hi, Gerard.",2024,2
2,8,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Jeremy, I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question. I noticed on the average balances the n on-interest -
bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter -to-quarter versus prior quarters wh en they’ve steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of
course, investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate,  if you can, what
you’re seeing in that non -interest -bearing deposit  account? I know this is average and not period, and the end number may actually be lower.
But what are you guys seeing here?",2024,2
3,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I have to be honest,  I hadn’t focused on that particular sequential explain, i.e., quarter -on-quarter change and
average non -interest -bearing deposits. But I think the more important question is the big picture question, which is what do we expect? How
are we thinking about o ngoing migration of non -interest -bearing into interest -bearing in the current environment and how that affects our NII
outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits?
And the answer to that question is that, we do continue to expec t that migration to happen. So, if you think about it, in the Wholesale space,
you have a bunch of clients with some balances and non -interest -bearing accounts, and over time for a variety of reasons, we do see them
moving those balances into interest -bearing. So, we do continue to expect that migration to happen and therefore, that will be a source of
headwinds. And that migration sometimes happens internally, i.e., out of non -interest -bearing into interest -bearing or into CDs. Sometimes, it
goes into mone y markets or into investments, which is what we see happening in our Wealth Management business and some of it does leave
the company. But one of the things that we're encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that y ield-
seeking flow through CDs and money market offerings, et cetera, across our various franchises. So, big picture. I do think th at migration out of
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A
non-interest -bearing into interest -bearing will continue to be a thing and that is a contributor to the mo dest headwinds that we expect for NII
right now. But, yeah, I'll leave it at that, I guess.",2024,2
4,8,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Very good. And as a follow -up, you've been very clear about the Consumer Credit Card charge -offs and delinquency levels, and we all know
about the Commercial Real Estate Office. And you always talk about overearning on net interest income, of course. One o f the great credit
quality stories for everyone, including yourselves, is the C&I portfolio, how strong it's been in this elevated rate environm ent? And I know your
numbers are still quite low, but in the Corporate and Investment Bank, you had about a $500  million pickup in non -accrual loans. Can you
share with us what are you seeing in C&I? Are there any early signs of cracks or anything? And, again, I know your numbers ar e still good, but
I'm just trying to look forward to see if there's something here ov er the next 12 months or so.",2024,2
5,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. It's a good question. I think the short answer is no. We're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes , I agree with you,
like the C&I charge -off rate has been very, very  low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember
correctly. I think the C&I charge -off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical
standards. And while  we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of
our credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not – we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss exp ectation. So, you
have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy a nd quite
idiosyncratic. So, I don't think that anything in the current quarter's results is indicative of anythin g broader, and I haven't heard anyone
internally talk that way, I would say.",2024,2

0,9,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Hi, good morning. I just had one clean -up question, Jeremy. The consensus provision for 2024 is $10.7 billion. Could you maybe clarify for
once and for all sort of Jamie's comments a t an industry conference earlier and try to sort of triangulate if that $10.7 billion provision is
appropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in Card?",2024,2
1,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial  Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Happy to clarify that. So, Jamie's comments were that the allowance – the build and the Card allowance, so we're talking about Card
specifically, we expected something like $2 billion for the full year. As I sit here today, our expectation for that n umber is actually slightly
higher, but it's in the ballpark. And I think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change f or the year, last time
I checked, it still looked a little low on that front. So, who knows what it'll a ctually wind up being, but that remains our view.
One question that we've gotten is how to reconcile that build to the 12% growth in OS that we've talked about because it seem s like a little bit
high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if yo u apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth. But the reason
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial  Officer, JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A
that's the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix, as we continue to see some normalization revolve in tha t 12%, as well as
seasoning of earlier vintages, whic h comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of OS growth.",2024,2

0,10,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Oh, hey, good morning. Maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital. It seems like the two primary ways t o do that
organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So, maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year -over-
year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand? And is there further opportunities to grow that?
And then, secondly, outside of Card, loan demand has been quite weak and any thoughts from yo u on if you're seeing any change in demand
or how you're thinking about loan demand going forward? Thanks.",2024,2
1,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Jim. Good questions. So, yeah, trading assets have been up. That is basically client activity, primarily secured fina ncing -related sort
of matchbook repo -type stuff and similar things that are – gross up the balance sheet quite a bit, but are quite  low risk and therefore, quite low
RWA intensity. So, while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that we're happy about and it's very mu ch represents us
leaning into the franchise to serve our clients. It's not really particularly R WA and therefore, capital intensive and therefore, doesn't really
reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital, so to speak.
On the loan demand front, yeah, I mean, unfortunately, I just don't have much new to say there on loan demand, meani ng, to your point, loan
demand remains quite muted everywhere except Card. Our Card business is, of course, in no way capital constrained. So, whatev er growth
makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and reta in accounts and what fits inside our credit
risk appetite, is growth that's going to make sense. And so, we're very happy to deploy capital to that. But it's not constra ined by our
willingness or ability to deploy capital to that.
And, of course, for the rest of the loan space, the last thing that we're going to do is have the excess capital, meaning tha t we lean into lending
that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box, especially in a world where spreads are quite  compressed and terms are under
pressure. So, there's always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally and frankly, that is , in some sense,
a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now. When I talked about if  there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not
deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are, now would be it in t erms of being
patient. That's a little bit one example of what I was ref erring to.",2024,2

0,1,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Hey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex. Markets about 6%. So, can you
just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit  behavior and pricing since
the 50 basis point cut?
And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow -up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a
month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for 2025? Thanks.",2024,3
1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Sure, Jim. I'll try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability. So, as we sit here today, the biggest single driver of the
sequential decline is, in fact – that we're expecting – is, in fact, the yield curve. So, that yield curve has changed a little bit since Daniel made
his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter, but not that significantly.
In terms of deposit balances, which is obviously another important factor here in light of the Fed starting the cutting cycle , it feels to us like
right now, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks for Consumer, we're pretty much in the trough right now as w e speak. When you look at
yield-seeking behavior that has come down quite a bit, so that's no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal. And then if you look at
checking account balances, those have been pretty stable for some time, which we see as  an indication that consumers are kind of done
spending down their cash buffers. So that's kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances.
And in that context, the other relevant point is the CD mix where, with the rate cuts coming, we expect CD balances to price down with pretty
high betas and probably the CD mix actually peaking around now.
And then as we move to Wholesale, we've actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there, and when you combine that with the sort of
increasing view that many people in the market have that it's likely that the end of QT will be announced sometime  soon, that's also a little bit
supportive for deposit balances.
So, maybe, I'll – well, I guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year. So, I guess one thing to say, right, is that we did have a
sequential increase in NII this quarter and, as you may recall, at Investor Day, I said that there was some chan ce that we would see sequential
increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we'd hit the troug h when that
happens. So that's essentially exactly what we're seeing now.
But from where we sit now, given the yield curve, assuming the yield curve materializes obviously, we do see a pretty clear p icture of
sequential declines in NII ex. Markets, but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year, at which poi nt the combination of
balances, Card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth, obviously.
We're guessing it's pretty far out in the future, and we'll give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter, but I th ink that gives you a better
framework to work with.",2024,3
2,1,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,All right. Thanks a lot.,2024,3
3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Thanks.,2024,3
0,2,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Hi. Good morning. So Jeremy, how are you? So I do want to ask on expenses, just in light of some of the comments that Daniel had made
recently, just noting that consensus expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light. I believe at the time it w as just below $94 billion.
If we adjust for the one -timers this year, that would suggest a core expense base that's just below  $90 billion, so pretty healthy step -up in
expenses. I know you've always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment. Just want to better understand where  those
incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prior itized in particular looking out to next year.",2024,3
1,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. So good question and I agree with your numbers. I agree with the way you've normalized this year for the one -time type of significant
items and also where the consensus was when Daniel made his comments.
And while we're at it, I would also just remind you on the NII comments at the time, the consensus for this year was $91.5 bi llion and for next
year it was $90 billion so that was implying at the time a sequential decline of $1.5 billion. It was because we  felt that decline wasn't big
enough that we made the comments that we made. So happy to expand more on that, but anyway.
To expenses. Yeah. So if you start for the sake of argument with a base of $90 billion, obviously, inflation is normalizing a nd obviously we're
always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation. But, that having been said, if you assume 3% for the  sake of argument on that base,
that's a few billion dollars right out of the gates that we're working against. So that's one thing.
The other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so there's a not insignificant amount  of annualization.
You can't quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers because of the seasonality of incentive comp., but if you  were to strip that out, you
would see probably some sequential increases and so annualization as an additional headwind.
The other thing that's worth noting is that we do expect fees and volume -related businesses to grow next year. And so all else being equal,
that would come with a higher expense loading. So when you assemble all of those, that goes a long way to explain wh y sort of that
consensus number that is slightly below $94 billion just seemed light.
In terms of priorities and investments, really nothing has changed, like the strategy hasn't changed. The strategy hasn't cha nged and the plans
haven't changed and we're just kind of executing with the same long -term perspective that we've always had.
I would note that relative to NII, obviously, we're in the third quarter now, not the fourth quarter. And in the old days, we  did used to give you
the guidance until Investor Day in late February. So we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter fo r both, well, for expenses and NII
next quarter. But especially on expenses, we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little les s visibility there
than we do at the margin on NII.",2024,3
2,2,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And can I just give you just a view of expense a little bit? What you call expenses very often I call investments. If you act ually go back to
Investor Day, you'll see that we're adding private bankers in Asset & Wealth Management, we're adding ETF in Asset  & Wealth Management,
we're adding private bankers in international Private Banking. We're growing Chase Wealth Management. We've added some branch es
across the United States of America. We think there are huge opportunities for Innovation Economy that tak es bankers and certain
technology, stuff like that.
Our goal is to gain share and everything we do, we get really good returns on it. So I look at that, these are opportunities for us. These are not
expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on. And we do get, and we show you kind of extensively cost and productivity  on various
things. And also AI is going to go up a little bit and I would put that as a category that just is going to generate great stuff over time.",2024,3
3,2,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Thank you both for the color. Just a quick follow -up for me, just drilling down into NII. It appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or
excess reserves at the Fed into securities. We saw the yield expand, which was encouraging, despite the pressure at  both the long end and
SOFR contraction in the quarter. I was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment. I  know that you've
Steven Chubak
Analyst, Wolfe Research LLC  Q
had some aversion to that in the past. But do you anticipate redeploying additional excess liquidity just amid the expectatio n for deeper rate
cuts?",2024,3
4,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Sure. So on extending duration, Steve, you know this obviously, but I just think it's important to say that all else equal, extending
duration doesn't change expected NII if you assume that the policy rate follows the forward, right? So, point one.
Point two, the curve remains inverted. And so even if you don't believe that the policy rate follows the forwards, extending right now is actually
a headwind to short -term NII like that wouldn't be a consideration for us either way, but I just think that's  worth saying for the broader
audience. It's quite different from the situation that you have on the numbers...",2024,3
5,2,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"... people have mortgages at 6%, so, right.",2024,3
6,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Now so when we think of the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now, a couple things to sa y. So,
obviously, a lot of different versions of duration, but one number that we disclose is the EaR. When the 10 -Q comes out, you'll see that that
number is a little bit lower. It'll come down from $2.8 billion to about $2.1 billion if our current estimates are correct. T hat's for a number of
reasons, some of which are passive, but so me of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit.
And in the end, the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of NII against protecting t he company from
extreme scenarios on either side. And so right now, if we wanted to extend as a result of different factors, we cer tainly could. We have the
capacity inside the portfolio. But for now, we're comfortable with where we are.",2024,3
7,2,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,And the one thing I can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months.,2024,3
8,2,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Well said. Well, thank you so much for taking my questions.",2024,3
9,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Steve.",2024,3
0,3,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow -up. As you can
imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone is trying to figure out the over/under for net interest income next
year. So maybe a two -part first question, the second being inspired by what Jamie just said.
Erika Najarian
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q
Number one, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year -over-year in 2025, consensus has it down 4% from your
new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down, and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it coul d be a little bit worse
year-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, we have no idea what the curve is going to  look
like. Right? It's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPM organ to have more cuts in the short end but
steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?",2024,3
1,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right. Okay. You threw a curve ball at the end there, Erika. I wasn't expecting that to be the end of your question. But let me answer the
beginning of your question, and then I'll also answer the end of your question.
So we see the current 2025 consensus for NII ex. Markets to be currently at $87 billion, which is obviously lower than it was  at the conference
earlier in the quarter. So we're happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us. That still looks a litt le toppy, but it's definitely in the
ballpark.
Now that consists of, I already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the NII trough sometime in the middle of the year , so you can kind
of assemble the parts. You've got a fourth quarter run rate, you've got some sequential declines, you've got a tr ough in the middle of the year,
and you've got a rough ballpark for the full year.
So you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolve r esumes in the
back half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of Card revolve, although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you
might have otherwise thought. I mean, sorry. A little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind.
Obviously, the mix of those things will play out in different ways, and as you point out, who knows what the yield curve will  wind up doing. But
on our current assumptions, on the current yield curve, and remembering that we're in the third quarter now, so  we're doing this kind of early,
that's what we think.",2024,3
2,3,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Can I just say something. First of all, next time let's just give them the damn number. I don't want to spend all the time on these calls li ke going
through what they're guessing what NII is going to be next year.
Can I just also point out that NII, all things being equal, is a number, but all things are never equal. And the yield curve,  if you have a recession
the effect of the yield curve will be very different than if you have continued growth. And there are deci sions that are made nonstop by us and
the things that happen in the marketplace, and I think we spend too much time on just this irrelevancy so you get a model, a number in your
model. And so it's going to be less than $87 billion next year. Probably not a  lot, we don't know, and we don't know the environment.",2024,3
3,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Good. Okay. Now to your question about the EaR. So, a few things to say in there. So, as I already mentioned, when that comes  out, it'll show
a number around $2.1 billion. A very important thing to say is, as you know, the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical EaR
is meaningfully higher than our modeled EaR, which is what we disclose. And the main reason for that is that retail deposit b etas have, in
actuality, been lower than the modeled deposi t betas.
So as a starting point, you have to kind of adjust that EaR number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons,
actually, there's some nuances around how the dollar, non -dollar sensitivity interact. And then there's your questio n which is a little bit about
the front -end versus the back -end.
So, what you see is that actually the front -end EaR has gotten smaller and most of the EaR is now in the back -end. So, it's definitely the case
that, all else being equal, a steeper curve is better for us. But I think what I would also say is that this kin d of empirical versus theoretical
adjustment is disproportionately in the front -end. So therefore, in order to answer your question, I would say, yes, we want a steeper curve, but
having the Fed cut more than what's currently in the yield curve is definite ly at the margin, for the context of next year's numbers a headwind –
would be a headwind for us, we remain asset sensitive to Fed cuts.",2024,3
4,3,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"And if I can ask my second question, and, Jamie, I completely understand your frustration. And to be fair, your long -term shareholders really
don't care about whether it's $87 billion or $85 billion. Right? They care about your return on equity. To that end, I mean, it's insane how much
capital you generate each quarter, 72 basis points this quarter.
And so, beyond the standard boilerplate questions you're going to get on buyback and organic growth, yada, yada, dividend inc reases, how
should we think about JPMorgan deploying this capital? I mean, the world is generally your oyster, right? You're domina nt already, and you
could use this capital to further enhance your business.
And again, beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter, how should your shareholders think about h ow you're
thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital?",2024,3
5,3,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Okay. First of all, when you say dominant, I'd be very careful on that. We've got some very tough competition, different in d ifferent countries,
different around the world, fintech companies, direct lenders and I want to give you a very specific comment on  direct lending and stuff like
that. So our goal is always to serve our clients. And when I talk about some of these expenses, that is a deployment of capit al, and it's a
deployment in a different way. If you open branches, you initially experience an expe nse, but down the road you need capital to support the
deposits. Same for the Innovation Economy, same for private bankers, et cetera. If you look at it roughly, we have about a mi nimum $30 billion
of excess capital. And for me, it's not burning a hole in my pocket. I look at it as you own the whole company and you can't properly deploy it
now, it is perfectly reasonable to wait. And I've been quite clear that I think the future could be quite turbulent. And asse t prices, in my view, in
life you've got to t ake a view sometimes, are inflated. I don't know if they're extremely inflated or a little bit, but I prefer to wait.
We will be able to deploy it. Our shareholders will be very well served by us waiting. And same thing with deploying capital.  We can go buy
$100 billion, 6% mortgages, increase our net income by a couple billion tomorrow. We don't make decisions like that.  The most important thing
we do is serve our clients well, build the technology and do things like that. And we also don’t know what the real excess ca pital is yet. So,
we're a little patient. We're going to be a little patient and wait, and it'll be fine.
And so that's where we are, and that's not going to change. And if it changes, we'll let you know. We do talk to a lot of sha reholders, and they
understand that buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do, because we think we'll
have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point. Markets do not stay high forever.",2024,3
6,3,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,Thank you.,2024,3
7,3,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"One last thing. Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world. And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpilin g cash right now.
I mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we're trying to navigate in this world and grow for t he long term for our company.",2024,3
0,4,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,"Hi. Thanks very much. And so glad Jamie didn't say what he was about to say because that's the answer to this question.
So we've seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers. We've seen limited loan growth for a few y ears now,
market -related also; limited flows into fixed income funds, yet plenty of growth in private credit in general. And you're  one of the best asset
managers on the planet, but in my view, less dominant in all things private credit. So maybe you could talk about what things  you're working
Glenn Schorr
Analyst, Evercore ISI  Q
on and why that's too narrow of a view of your ability to serve all parts of clients’ lending needs, not just the public markets and public lending
side. Thanks.",2024,3
1,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So let me take time to cover this one, because obviously it has become very important. People talking about how they're  growing and
partnering and things like that.
And so first and foremost – I’m going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical, I think they're both important. First and foremost, we
are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them. Therefore, wh en a client come s
in, we will offer them both direct lending, ourselves, and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending. And they all have pluses and
minuses.
Direct lending could be done faster, maybe simpler covenants, unitranche. It is more expensive and you're just seeing a littl e things go back
and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending. But we're going to offer the clients basically what's in their best interest and tell them
what those products are across the venue.
We mentioned before in the past that we allocated $10 billion of capital to make direct loans. We've actually deployed a lot of capital. Some of
those have already been paid off, some of it’s done. So we are going to do it directly and we are going to – $10 billion could be $20 billion or
$30 billion, not limiting it today. I will say today, we're extending. We will do $500 million, we will do $1 billion, we wil l do more than $1 billion,
we'll do it sole -handed or we'll do it with partners.
Very importantly, we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner. So we have – I think we've announced a bunch of co -lenders, but that
just creates more flexibility and more size. We're not going to use that flexibility to slow it down and have to g et permission from everybody,
because like I said, JPMorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact. And we're go ing to use our own
risk measures and stuff like that, again, all in the service of the client and mak ing sure we're offering them the best thing.
And we're going with different strategies. We're not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider. I think that  would limit what we
could offer our clients, it probably would be more price competitive. We could do some of this very specific t hing and not the solution that this
is the third -party capital provider. That's our strategy. We're going to be there, we're going to do it, and we're going to do it in spite  of the fact
there's capital arbitrage taking place.
So if you look at the arbitrage today, where a bank has to hold for things, where insurance could, they are dramatically diff erent. That's a
disadvantage, but we've had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time. We are going to do what's righ t for the client.
Remember, when we do business with a client, we also get other revenues off of them. So it isn't just the loan; we look at th e whole
relationship. So we're quite comfortable we can compete. I just announced much bigger lending platforms a nd sizes and stuff like that, so I
hope if any of the press is on they heard this too.",2024,3
2,4,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore ISI,All right. Thanks for all that.,2024,3
0,5,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Good morning, Jeremy, and good morning, Jamie. Jeremy, when you guys look at your current capital ratios, they are obviously very healthy.
Can you guys give us some color on the new Basel III? We don't know what the specifics are, but as Vice Chair Barr to uched on some of the
specifics, it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original prop osal.
How are you guys thinking about that? Do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where yo u are today?",2024,3
1,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. When I said we're at $30 billion of excess, that is assuming Barr's speech, that the 20% goes to 12% or whatever it is, more. It'll be
more than that because there are other factors involved. Now, I was just giving the minimum of excess capital. In my view, it  would be more,
but it is what it is and we'll wait to see the final numbers.",2024,3
2,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"But, Gerard, just maybe to give you a bit of color. So, yeah. Obviously, everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech. It was an important
speech. But in the end, we actually just really need to see the proposal because the details matter a lot for this stuff. And so our focus is on
hoping to see the proposal so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate.
I note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed which was obviously true per the speech, but I
do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that that's like progress just because the or iginal proposal wa s so
dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable. And I would remind you, which you obviously know, that before th is proposal
came out, it was our position strongly felt, that our then -prevailing capital requirements were, if anything, alre ady more than we needed.
So we've got a long way to go here, and I think our position, which Jamie has been articulating very consistently, is that th ey need to get it
right with the right amount of work, and importantly, do it holistically so it's not just RWA. It's RWA, it's G -SIB, it's SCB, it's CCAR. So that's
really what we feel strongly about.",2024,3
3,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"We just want the numbers to be done right and justified. If they had to go up, we would be fine with that too. We just think they should be done
with real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about cost benefit, what it does to the econom y, where it pushes lending and
things like that. So we're anxiously awaiting to see the actual detail, because that's what's going to make all the differenc e.",2024,3
4,5,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Very good. And then as a follow -up, in view of this excess capital and your comments a moment ago about direct lending, you look at your
current cash and marketable securities on a risk-weighted asset basis, you put it in your presentation of course, $1.5 trillion. Average loans is
$1.3 trillion. When the dust settles, you know what your capital requirements are. Can you frame out for us, levering up the excess capital with
more loan s, is that a path that might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis? I know you're
going to grow your loans, but I'm talking about the mix.",2024,3
5,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Absolutely, positively not. Loans are an outcome of doing good business. We want to do good business. If it grows our balance  sheet, we're
fine.",2024,3
6,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And I do think, Gerard, it depends a lot on what type of loans you're talking about, right? So I think in the end, as Jamie says, like it's capital.
We're going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically, and that could include loans that are almost good loans o n a stand -alone
basis, as well as loans that are part of an overall relationshi p, what we're getting other revenue as part of that. So it's the same strategy that
we've always had, but I wouldn't think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product. I would thin k of it as it's there for a
rainy day. Let's ho pe the environment doesn't deteriorate a lot, but if it does, we'll be ready. And there will be opportunities hopefully to de ploy
it against a client franchise or against a stock. And if not, we'll return it. But not now.",2024,3

0,6,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Good morning. So lower rates was supposed to drive a pick -up in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines.
Obviously, we just had one cut and it's early. But any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing m ore, and again, conversion
of the banking pipelines?",2024,3
1,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I would say, Matt, generally no, frankly, with a couple of minor exceptions. So I think it's probably fair to say that the ou tperformance late in the
quarter in investment banking fees was to a meaningful degree, as I mentioned, driven by DCM as well as to  some degree driven by the
acceleration of the closing of some M&A transactions. And I do think that some of that DCM outperformance is in the sort of t ypes of deals that
are opportunistic deals that aren't in our pipeline, and those are often driven by tr easurers and CFOs sort of seeing improvement in market
levels and jumping on those. So it's possible that that's a little bit of a consequence of the cuts.
As I think I mentioned we did see, for example, a pick -up in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of pick -up in refi. And our multi -family lending
business, there might be some hints of more activity there. But these cuts were very heavily priced. Right? T he curve has been inverted for a
long time. So to a large degree, this is expected. So it's not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reacti ons, and that's not
really what we're seeing.",2024,3
2,6,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And also in the debt markets, rates came down, spreads are quite low, and markets are wide open. So it kind of makes sense that
people are taking advantage of that today. Those conditions may not prevail, be the ongoing conditions late next year.",2024,3
3,6,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"And then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out, you had nice growth year -over-year, up 6%, flat quarter -over-
quarter, I know there's a lot of seasonality 2Q to 3Q. I think last year, it was up about 1%. But are you seeing any kind of changes in the
consumer spend either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter? Thank you.",2024,3
4,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal, so
meaning – I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic, but maybe one last time . One
of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a  lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadn't done
before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discreti onary spending,
and that's now normalized. And you would normally t hink that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers
battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we  see it as is
actually like normalizatio n. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending.
So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on sol id footing and
consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of no -landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we
always point out, that's one scenario and there are many other scenarios.",2024,3

1,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I think it's wrong. I've always been an American patriot. My country is more important to me than my company, and I think thi s government is
very important to get this – and if you look at the world today, Mike, it is so important that we get things right for the whole geopolitical world.
I'm not just talking about the American economy, and we try to participate in policy at the local level, at the state level, at the federal level, at
the international leve l to try to help. That's our job. We try to grow economies and things like that. So nothing has changed in my view, my
opinion, or my interest. I just think it's very, very important that we try to help the government do a good job.",2024,3
2,7,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"So if you were asked by the next administration to serve the country, would you be open to considering it?",2024,3
3,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I think the chance of that is almost nil and I probably am not going to do it, but I've always reserved the right. I don't make promise to people. I
don't have to. But no, I love what I do. I intend to be doing what I'm doing. I almost guarantee I'll be doing this for a lon g period of time or at
least until the board kicks me out.",2024,3
4,7,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Let me take the flip side of that question for those of you who are worried about you leaving. The other side of the question  is we were on
these calls the last couple of years. You're saying the stock is over -valued, and I think that's what you're saying.  You're saying the stock
market is over -valued and therefore all stocks are over -valued. And on the one hand, you guys, you highlight on this call AI, tech, market
share gains, high returns, high capital. So, do you think in some ways when we think about t he value of your price, and your ability to do
buybacks, you're thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might p ut you in the
category of more tech -oriented firms, especially as it relates to your  progress with AI.",2024,3
5,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Listen, you're making a very good point, which is I think we have an exceptional company, exceptional franchises, and the pri ce point at which
you might buy the stock. But I'm not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values.
And so I'm just – we're just quite patient in that, and I think you're going to have to judge us over time about whether we're done the right t hing
to do nothing. And remember, we could always do it. We haven't lost the money. It didn't go away. It's sitting in store. The onl y time that would
be really wrong is if the stock runs way up, we've got to buy at much higher prices. And I just, I would be a rea l skeptic about that happening.",2024,3
0,8,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Yeah, good morning. I guess just wanted to follow -up. You talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending. Another area I would
appreciate if you can address is we've been hearing a lot about the likes of Jane Street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed
income trading. Is that a real risk? And is there an opportunity for a firm like JPMorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on
market making beyond traditional sort of FICC activi ty?",2024,3
1,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Ebrahim, the way I would frame that is not as a risk but as a reality. We've always emphasized in all of our businesses  that we operate
in an extremely competitive environment, and that applies to – and that competitive environment isn't limited to c ompeting against banks or
traditional financial institutions. It extends in the consumer space to fintechs. And in the market making space, it obviousl y increasingly is
extending to some of the types of firms that you're referring to.
Now those firms are, in many cases, also clients. And that's the same type of dynamic that you see, for example, in the priva te credit space
that we've discussed before. So there's no question that the ecosystem is changing. You've got new competitors. You 've got changes in
market structure, new dynamics. And as with any business, we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that we're prepared  to compete
in all the traditional ways and all the new ways.
Of course, there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that. And one of the arguments that we've made  going back to
the capital and liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of U.S. capital markets ecosys tem, which is the end view
of the world, its worked well in its current construct for a long time where some activities were inside the regulated perime ter and there was
robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts. And a world where more  and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank
market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested, and it's unclear why you would want that. And we've cautioned that if
that's the intent of the regulations, it should be intenti onal and well -studied. But in the meantime, we're going to adjust and compete to the best
of our ability given the constraints of the current rule set.",2024,3
2,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"The previous answer on the private markets, it remains to be seen how that develops. There is a little bit of that, and some people are talking
about making more active things in private markets. In some ways we're well -positioned for that too, because for that you need liquidity,
market -making valuation, buyers and sellers on bo th sides to create liquidity. So that hasn't developed yet, but we may have competition, but
we'll be there when the time comes.
And the second one is the public markets. You have seen reports about you have deal inventories, both corporate and treasurie s. And I do
think that's capital. But again, we do it, remember, for clients. So we are large market makers on both sides of the ma rkets for clients in both
credit and treasuries, which is a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account. And so t hey are both
competition from our standpoint, but we're there. We're going to do it. We're can always dep loy more capital if we want. And we would even
deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do that to service clients. So we're very conscious of it. There wil l be competition both
sides. As Jeremy said, we sat here 10 years ago talking about the electronification of the business and can we keep up with that, and so far
we have.",2024,3
3,8,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Got it. And just one quick one. And, Jeremy, you, I think, mentioned QT stopping at some point. We saw the repo sort of marke t spike at the
end of September. Give us your perspective on just the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into year -end and d o you have a view on
how quickly Fed should recalibrate QT or actually stop QT to prevent some loss? Thanks.",2024,3
4,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. It's a good question, Ebrahim. But I think you've kind of answered your own question. In other words, like the argument out there is that
the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comf ortable level of
reserves that's been heavily speculated about. And recognizing that that numbe r is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firm's
liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures.
And side point, it's just another reason why it's important to look at the whole framework holistically when we think about t he regulatory
response of the events of two springs ago. You don't want those types of spikes and it raises some questions about wh y there isn't more
readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions, albeit this one was relatively minor.
But in any case, when you put all that together, it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe QT should be wound  down and
that seems to be increasingly the consensus that that's going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter. So my  only point was if you
play that view through, it's a residual headwind for system -wide deposit growth which gets removed. And that's one of the reasons that we feel
that we're probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level of...",2024,3
5,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So I just want to add a couple policy things here. I'm not actually sure they can actually do that, because you have inflatio nary factors out
there, partially driven by QE. And also, look at the volatility. It's not a risk to JPMorgan. It's a risk to the system. And what banks have, I
already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit. So the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy the repo
markets. And is it a good policy thing that every ti me that happens, because you can do it very safely, fully collateralized, all things like that,
providing what I call flexible financing in the marketplace, that that happens, the Fed has to step in every time? I think th at becomes a policy
issue that ever y time there's some kind of fluctuation in the market, people panic and the Fed has got to step in and provide stuff. And can
they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward?
So I think you've got to be very thoughtful about this and that's why we do think they should look at calibrating SLR and ECL R and CET1, all of
these things, particularly for this. So my view is, it is going to happen again. I can't tell you exactly when, but I'd be surprised if it doesn't
happen again.",2024,3
6,8,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,Got it. Thank you both.,2024,3

5,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah. We can hear you. Can you hear us?,2024,3
6,9,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Oh, yes. Thank you. So one for Jeremy, one for Jamie. Jeremy and Jamie, Sorry about the NII question I'm going to have, but i t is more than
half your revenue so I kind of care about it.
But when I'm thinking about the trough and then the build -up, QT ending, deposit growth, I mean, that's part of the calculation for improvement
as we go into 2025. Right? I should embed that outlook. Is that right? And that's embedded in how you're thinkin g about it. I know we don't
have a number for you for NII for 2025 but it is in there. Right?",2024,3
7,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. In other words, it goes back to my prior point and to the point that I had in the prepared remarks about the consumer d eposit balances
in particular –",2024,3
8,9,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,Right.,2024,3
9,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"– that there's lots of different offsetting factors right now, right. You've got the yield curve, you've got Card revolve, you' ve got balances. And
balances have been a headwind. We now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year. And one of the
potential reasons for that is – one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of QT, but emphasize the word potential, to Jamie's
point.
You also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset, fixed -rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit. While we're on NII,
just to annoy Jamie a little bit more, I do want to make a point that I didn't get a chance to make previo usly, which is there's a reason that we
emphasize the implied fourth quarter run rate for the Markets NII in the presentation which is that if you take that and you annualize it, it gives
you a launch point run rate, which is significantly higher than what 's currently in the consensus and obviously what we've seen this year. And
I'll give you the concise version of my usual speech that changes in Markets NII are almost always bottom -line neutral and offset in NIR. But
for the purposes of trying to help you guys with your models, I would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is, the number of
cuts that are in the curve, the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past has been quite liability -sensitive, so you can draw
your o wn conclusions about what that should mean. Again, shouldn't change the overall revenue expectation. It's just a balance shee t and
income statement geography issue. But just for the sake of helping you tidy up models, I wanted to make that point.",2024,3
10,9,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,And so Daniel's comments in September were on NII in total or NII ex. Markets? Could you just clarify that?,2024,3
11,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"No. Those were core NII or NII ex.. So again, reiterating at the time, the 2024 consensus was $91.5 billion. The 2025 consens us was $90
billion on NII ex. and our point was that that number, which remains an asset -sensitive number, indicated an insufficien t amount of sequential
decline year -on-year. The current consensus as we see it for NII ex. Markets is $87 billion. And as we've noted, that's closer albeit maybe s till
a little bit toppy.",2024,3
12,9,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Okay. Then one for Jamie. Jamie, we did talk already quite a bit about the capital that you have, capital in store. Just want ed to understand
how you're thinking about that opportunity set that's in front of you with regard to using it for potentially portfolio acquisitions. I realize that
depositories are not on the docket, but we all know there's portfolios out there that might be looking for a home. And  could you give us a sense
as to how interested you might be in acquiring assets at this stage?",2024,3
13,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So asset acquisitions, I mean I always want our people to be looking at those things and thinking about those things. B ut if you listen to
what I'm saying about my caution about the world, it's hard for me to say that we're going to be in the market to buy credit assets.",2024,3
14,9,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,What about loans? The Apple card…,2024,3
15,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"But creating those assets to help clients. That's a whole different matter because when it comes to clients, we earn credit a sset spread and we
usually have other stuff. If our bankers can deploy capital that way, of course be that we want to do more. And our CIO could deploy capital in
multiple ways, we would probably do more. And we ask all the time can we do more in affordable housing, can we do more in thi ngs we're
actually quite comfortable. And yeah, if we could find ways to deplo y capital, we would be happy to do that. But put us in your closest

Well, but having – it's very important. While I say that, I always tell the management team second -guess me. I mean, we’ve done private label.
I know what it is, we've been there. I have a lot of issues with it. But is it possible it's going to be different one day an d a different thing? Yeah,
it's possible, so I don't want to cut  it off. If Marianne Lake says to me, Jamie I think clearly the world's changed, we're going to change. But

20,9,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,Thank you so much.,2024,3
0,10,Saul Martinez,Analyst,Inc .,"Hey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in 2025, but I did want to delve into the how to think about you r deposit margin in
volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years. You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit ma rgin, 2.6%, down about
30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so it put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still wel l above where
they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve now has b een going. So I guess how do we think about
both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say, to the level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward
curve is likely going to be long, but that's the reference point we have.
And conversely, volume offset. You mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. But, I guess, how much of a ta ilwind could
they be, especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sen se of sort of the push and
pull of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit, the value of the deposit franchise.",2024,3
1,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Yeah, thanks for the question, Saul. And I think you've laid out the building blocks there already. Just for simplicity , I'm going to try to
answer your question without referring to the disclosed CCB deposit margin number, just because that number i s obviously the combination of
the rate paid on the CCB deposits and the internal FTP into that. And that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of
the betas and other things. So I think it's actually more helpful to look at this  simply from a Firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of
the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly, and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of fa ctors.
And I think when you do that, what you see is we've been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purpose s is simply the
difference between the policy rate and the weighted -average rate paid of the consumer deposits, was unsustainably h igh. And that was going
to have to correct one way or the other. Either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savi ngs, and/or we
were going to see a ton of internal migration, i.e. growth in the CD mix, and/or we would se e a lower policy rate. So as we sit here right now, of
course, we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is  for deposits,
but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy. We were never going to
chase sort of the hot money at the margin.
We've leaned in heavily to CDs and gotten to the current level of CD mix, and that's been a good strategy. And from where we sit now, we
now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down. It seems that, that puts us in a pretty com fortable position from
a pricing perspective. We think the CD mix has probably peaked.
Now, on the way down, it's not going to go back down to zero, where it was at the beginning of the cycle. That's an important  thing to realize.
So all else equal, that creates a little bit of margin compression. And then through all of that, obviously, a l ower yield environment should mean
that there's a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits, as I mentioned. We're seeing a lot less yield -seeking behavior. So then when you
overlay on to that what you mentioned, which is our long -term share growth in  CCB deposits, in no small part as a function of the brand
strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top 125 markets in CCB are at that 15% share number, so we believe
there's big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on t rack at the type of average annual share growth of the order of 30 basis points or 40
Jeremy Barnum

basis points that we've seen historically. That's how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and bala nce growth in
Consumer.",2024,3
2,10,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Jeremy, correct me if you think I'm wrong. The abnormal time period was when rates were between 0% and 1% or 2%. Other than that, if
you're looking at, say, what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business, forget people going after really hot money if that
happens, it's 2% to 2.5%.",2024,3
3,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Absolutely. Yeah, we agree.",2024,3

0,1,John McDonald,Analyst,Inc.,"Hi. Good morning. Jeremy, I wanted to ask about capital, and I know you get this question a lot about the kind of high-class dilemma of your
growing capital base and your perspective of that as earnings in store. So, I guess, what's the framework for thinking about the opportunity
cost of sitting on the growing base of capital and how high you might let that go versus your patience in waiting for more attractive deployment
opportunities?",2024,4
1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Good question, John, and welcome back, by the way.",2024,4
2,1,John McDonald,Analyst,Inc.,Thank you.,2024,4
3,1,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Welcome back, John. Read your piece the other day. It took me quite a while, but it was good work.",2024,4
4,1,John McDonald,Analyst,Inc,Thanks.,2024,4
5,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So, yeah, you've noted all the points that we always make so I won't repeat them. And I think the way we're thinking about it right now is that we
feel very comfortable with the notion that it makes sense for us to have a nice store of extra capital in light of the current environment. We
believe there's a good chance that there will be a moment where we get to deploy it at better levels essentially in whatever way than the current
opportunities would suggest. And so that feels like a correct kind of strategic and financial decision for us. Having said that, having studied it
quite extensively over the last six months and have all the debates that you would expect, we've concluded that we do have enough. We have
enough excess. And given that, we would like to not have the excess grow from here.
So, when you think about the implications of that, given the amount of organic capital generation that we're producing, it means that unless we
find in the near term opportunities for organic deployment or otherwise, it means more capital return through buybacks, all else being equal, in
order to arrest the growth of the excess. And that is our current plan, although, I'll give the caveat that, as you know, is in our disclosure, which
is we don't want to get in the business of guiding on buybacks, and we reserve the right to change the trajectory at any time for any reason, but
that is our current thinking.",2024,4
6,1,John McDonald,Analyst,Inc,"Okay. Thanks, Jeremy. And then just as a follow-up, when we think about the investment spend agenda this year, how does it differ from, say,
last year or last couple of years across lines of business in this kind of certainty of return spectrum you've talked about? And then what kind of
efficiencies are baked into the outlook as well? Thanks.",2024,4
7,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. The truth is – and I guess this is a good thing that the themes are remarkably consistent. So, we are seeing the results of our kind of high
certainty investment choices across all the categories that you know very well and that we highlighted on the outlook page for expenses, and
those continue to be the main areas of focus. The execution gets tweaked at the margin as we pursue different opportunities in the
Commercial & Investment Bank. We continue drilling down and analyzing into the relative pockets of weakness that you might see if you go a
level or two below the very significantly strong share positions that you see on an aggregate level. Daniel always talked about the reds and the
ambers that are behind the greens, and that's embedded in the culture of the company. So we do that everywhere and continue analyzing and
iterating, and we throw resources against that stuff as we do that. But, broadly, the themes are very consistent.
I think, in terms of efficiency, a couple of things to say, which you know well. One is, when we think about efficiency and how we generate it at
this company, it's organic, it's BAU, it's evergreen; it happens every day in all the teams, everywhere. And so that is sort of part of the bottoms-
up culture, and that remains the case. We do have a few top-down areas of focus. I think if I go, for example, into technology for starters, we're
putting a lot of effort into improving the sort of ability of our software engineers to be productive as they do development, and there's been a
lot of focus on that – the development environment for them, in order to enable them to be more productive. And so all else equal, that
generates a little bit of efficiency. We also have a lot of focus on the efficiency of our hardware utilization. And so that's embedded in there as
well.
And another thing that's worth noting, you'll recall that, at Investor Day, I talked about how we had probably reached peak modernization
spend. As Jamie always says, we're always modernizing. So, the fact that we've gotten to a peak and then it might come down a little bit from
here still means we're going to be constantly modernizing. But, at the margin, that means that inside the tech teams, there's a little bit of
capacity that gets freed up to focus on features and new product development and so on, which is also in some sense a form of efficiency.
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A
Finally, though, what I would say is that if you look at the head count trajectory of the company over the last few years, we have grown a lot and
it has been for very good reasons. And it has contributed quite a bit to our growth and to our ability to run the company efficiently.
But any time you have that quantum of headcount growth as well as that rate of headcount growth, you have to believe, all else equal, that
some amount of inefficiency has been introduced. And so, this year, as we went through the budget cycle, we ask people, at the margin, to try
to support the growth of the company while living within their means on the headcount front. So we're going to try to run things, with some
important exceptions that I'll highlight in a second, on roughly flat head count and have that lead to people generating internal efficiencies as
they get creative with their teams, and we consider more efficient ways of doing things. The obvious exceptions are the ongoing areas of high
certainty investment and growth, so, obviously, branches and bankers and so on. And also, critical non-negotiable areas of risk and control like
cyber or whatever independent risk management needs to ensure that we're running the company safely. So that's how we're thinking about
efficiency in the current moment.",2024,4

0,2,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"Hi. Simple and then more difficult, I guess. Jamie, who's your successor? And then the second question is, I know I asked the question at
Investor Day, why not stay as CEO a little bit longer? I think what I'm hearing from investors now, it goes up and down, but I think investors
would like you to stay. So, why say you're going to stay less than five years? You're finally getting what you wanted, 15 years, your spaghetti
chart about the regulatory structure and the unpredictability of capital requirements and regulatory costs, and it seems like you're finally
getting what you've been playing for. So, why not stay around a bit longer if investors want you to do so? And what would you do otherwise
anyway? You don't play golf. You aren't going to be Treasury Secretary. Seems like your work is your hobby, right? So how much longer would
you stay around?",2024,4

people in the company. It's about the Board. If I'm here for several more years, and I may or may not be Chairman. That's going to be up to the
Board. Does it really fit the new CEO and stuff like that? You're talking potentially four, five years or more. I'll be 69 in March. I think it's the
rational thing to do. I've had a couple health problems, you know. I just think it makes a lot of sense, and so – and what was your first question

3,2,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Oh, yeah. This is an unfortunate thing for any big company like this where these people have to be in the spotlight all the time and always to-ing
and fro-ing. We have several exceptional people. You guys know most of them. There's maybe one or two you don't know. The Board reviews
and meets with them all the time. I think it's wonderful that Jenn Piepszak, who does not want to be the CEO, will be here as Chief Operating
Officer and stay after that. So, obviously, she's going to work with those people which I think is great for a company, just having continuity of
management and leadership, and will be one of those people. And obviously, we're not going to tell the press, but it's not determined yet. And
of course, the last minute, a couple years from now people get sick, they change their mind, have family circumstances. So, even if you thought
you knew today, you couldn't be completely sure.",2024,4
4,2,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,"So, you'll stay around maybe for a few more years base case right now?",2024,4
5,2,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Basic case, yeah.",2024,4
6,2,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,All right. Thank you.,2024,4
0,3,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Hey. Good morning. Maybe just on regulation, we have a new administration coming in. We have a new, soon-to-be, I guess, a new head of
regulation at the Fed. So, maybe just talk about, again, what areas of the regulatory structure, if it were to change, would be most impactful for
you. And is there any areas where you think capital requirements could actually go down? Or is this more of a story of requirements just simply
stop going up? Thanks.",2024,4
1,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hey, Jim. I mean, it's obviously something we're thinking about a lot. But I could go down some pretty deep rabbit holes speculating on all the
different parts of the framework and how they could evolve, and I just don't really think that's productive right now. But let me make some
attempt to answer your question. So, backing up a second, if you read Jamie's quotes, they're very consistent with what we've been saying as a
company for a long time, which is that all we want is a coherent, rational, holistically-assessed regulatory framework that allows banks to do
their job, supporting the economy, that isn't reflexively anti-bank, that doesn't default to the answer to every question being more of
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A
everything, more capital, more liquidity, that uses data and that balances the obvious goal that we all share of a safe and sound banking system
with actually recognizing that banks play a critical role in supporting growth, and the hope is that we get some of that.
And that also, while we're at it, some aspects of the supervisory framework get a little bit less bureaucratic and a little less adversarial and a
little bit more substantive so that at the margin, management can focus its time on the things that matter the most. So, whether capital goes
up, down, stays flat is really so complicated because it's not just Basel III Endgame, it's also a G-SIB, it's also a number of other factors. And
that's why we keep hammering away on the importance of doing all of this holistically, properly with the right analysis. And if that takes time, so
be it.",2024,4
2,3,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Can I just add, no that's great. Jeremy gave it all. Let me add three quick things. Liquidity is also equally important. There's been a lot of
recognition that what counts as liquidity and discount windows and how LCR is done I think is very important. Second is competition. All these
things should be done in light of looking at what kind of public markets you want, what kind of private markets you want, what do you want in
the banking system, what you want out of the banking system. And the third is I think most people realize there is a huge need to take a step
back and look at the Byzantine, Balkanized system we built which has negatives, and even the regulators will tell you that. So, at one point, just
take a deep breath. As Jeremy said, let's do the right thing and continue to have the best financial system in the world.",2024,4
3,3,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Yeah. No, that makes sense. And maybe just as a follow-up, just on loan growth. Have you – since the election, it seems like CEO confidence,
business confidence has increased. So, are you starting to see any improvement in demand on lending? Just any thoughts there would be
great.",2024,4
4,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, it's a good question. And I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might
have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably
explained by a combination of wide-open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets and healthy
balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets and some industries where some
aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what
they're executing in the near-term. But, we'll see what the new year brings as the current optimism starts getting tested with reality, one way or
the other.
And maybe if it materializes with tangible improvements and things one way or the other, you'll actually see that come through C&I loan growth
in particular.",2024,4
5,3,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,Okay. Great. Thanks.,2024,4
0,4,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Yes. Hi, good morning. Wanted to follow up on the questions on capital and maybe ask about some of, Jeremy, the crosscurrents in terms of
the denominator. So, if we look at the third quarter regulatory data for your G-SIB surcharge score, that would imply that your score would put
you in a range of a 5% G-SIB. So, obviously, from what we understand, if you print that – somewhere near that score at the end of this year, then
your G-SIB surcharge goes up by – to 5% or by 50 basis points two years and one day from now. At the same time, around the holidays, we did
get the press release from both the Federal Reserve and the lawsuit from the banks. In terms of the transparency, it looks like the transparency
is going to be focused on perhaps being improved as soon as this year's stress test.
So, as we think about the definition of excess, right, because part of this is like 15.7% is clearly a huge number. So, as we think about your
returns going forward, the definition of excess also continues to shift. So, how should we think about those crosscurrents in terms of two big
components, clearly, one is your G-SIB surcharge and the other is your stress capital buffer?",2024,4
1,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Right, Erika. Okay. You are tempting me with many rabbit holes that are very deep. But let's try and address this not too much great length.
First of all, G-SIB. So, yes, it was a high print in the third quarter, but we had normal seasonality third quarter and fourth quarter. So, while our
current view of G-SIB number is an estimate, we're quite confident that we wound up comfortably in the 5% bucket just as a result of normal
seasonality. It was actually a relatively quiet December in terms of the types of year-end things that sometimes create pressures of various
types. So that is more or less what you might have otherwise expected in terms of our typical seasonal patterns. So, not much to see there.
And the obvious point also being that even under the existing proposed G-SIB rule, which is obviously a little bit hung up, with the smaller
buckets and some of the recalibration and so on, it's not even sort of obvious that it would have mattered one way or the other. But, anyway, for
now, we're managing to the current rules, and normal seasonality took us back under 5%. Okay, you mentioned the lawsuit. I think the only
thing to say about that is that we are happy to see the clear recognition on the part of the Fed that many of the things that we've been talking
about for a long time in terms of transparency and volatility, and some of the non-substantive bureaucratic burden associated with the CCAR
process needs improvement. So, that's great.
I think I won't speak for the industry bodies that were the actual litigants, but it seems to me, if you just read what they said publicly in their
press releases, this is as much as anything about preserving rights in light of the statute of limitations deadlines that were coming up. So, let's
just hope that we see some significant progress on that front. And then, taking a step back, at a high level, what you're really asking me is, what
is our core view about, and I think probably the best way to think about this is just through the lens of the numerator, actually. What is our core
view about if you just, for the sake of argument, assume modest growth in the normalized amount of economic denominator, like actual need
for capital organically, what will be the likely additional numerator that will be needed or not as a function of the environment.
And the way we're increasingly thinking about that is just doing different scenario analysis of like flat numerator, up 5% numerator, up 10%
numerator, up 20% numerator. I guess there could be some versions of the world where the numerator's a little less. And then guessing about
our central case and comparing our projected capital amount to that number to determine the excess. And as you point out, at 15.7%, and I
think the actual quantum of the numerator is something like $275 billion, through pretty much any reasonable lens, it's a ton of excess, which is
why we've concluded that it doesn't need to grow anymore.",2024,4
2,4,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"And just a follow-up question – a follow-up to John's line of questioning. As a placeholder, as we think about what you said, trying to arrest the
growth of CET1, for now, should we just assume that anything that you don't need for organic growth and your dividend obligations in terms of
that 15.7% will be bought back by the company as we think about? I know you don't want to predict the buyback, but is that sort of just a
placeholder for now as we think about what can return back to shareholders in the form of repurchase?",2024,4
3,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. You've quoted our capital hierarchy, and your conclusion flows naturally from my statement that we do want to arrest the growth of the
excess.",2024,4
4,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So, we are never going to tell the market what we're going to do. You all know that everybody is out there modeling these things, trading
against these things. So, steady consistent buyers in the marketplace who are so predictable are making a mistake.",2024,4
0,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Very good. We can go to the next question. Thanks. Yeah.,2024,4
0,6,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially over-earning on net interest income. And is this all
because of the higher rate environment that's expected now? Or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically on the
consumer side, which I think you had assumed it would reprice a bit more than we've seen?",2024,4
1,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, it's a good question, Matt. I guess maybe let me try to frame this from a couple different perspectives. So, on the one hand, you're right. If
you look at the NII guidance that we're giving you, including the notion that subject to the yield curve panning out in line with the current
forwards, which, as we know, is the one thing that we know won't happen. But if you want to assume something, if you assume the forwards,
we're sort of telling you that we might return to sequential growth in the back half of the year, again, based on all of our current assumptions, all
else being equal. And you could draw the conclusion that that means that the overearning narrative is no longer applicable.
I think if you take a big step back, by historical standards, the difference between the policy rate and the weighted average rate paid on
consumer deposits remains quite elevated for a variety of reasons and subject to the fact that in the end, deposit pricing is always going to be a
response to the competitive environment that we experience in the field, the current structure of the yield curve is such that, for the time being
anyway, when we do the math, that's what we see. Do we think that's truly, truly, truly sustainable through the cycle? Unclear. But I guess we'll
cross that bridge when we come to it. For now, this is the outlook for the coming year.",2024,4
2,6,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,And we've gotten closer to normalized NII and normalized credit.,2024,4
3,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah. It is worth noting that NII ex. Markets is down year-on-year. So there's some normalization there.,2024,4
4,6,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Okay. And then just separately, a strategic question. There's been some reports about you further expanding the Consumer Banking business
globally. And I guess I just want to push on that where we really haven't seen other banks do it in a successful way. Obviously, your approach is
kind of coming from a position of strength, leading digitally. But I guess I'm just wondering like is it worth it? Is there enough upside to justify
maybe some of the increased regulatory and execution risk of doing global consumer banking?",2024,4
5,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I think you kind of answered your own questions in a sense, like we talked about this a lot when we first launched the initiative. And I just
think that the comparison to other players is not apt in the current moment. That's not to say that like we're special or anything. It's just that the
strategy is very different and it's a very different moment. So it's a new initiative. It's obviously not risk-free, but it's going pretty well. And
pointing out the obvious, if we didn't think it was worth it, we wouldn't be doing it. But we have obviously considered all of the risks and
opportunities associated with the decision. And it's one of our strategic initiatives, and those get scrutinized quite aggressively through all of
our management processes.",2024,4
6,6,Matt O'Connor,Analyst,Inc.,Okay. Thank you.,2024,4
0,7,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,Hi. Good morning.,2024,4
1,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hey, Betsy.",2024,4
2,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Hey, Betsy.",2024,4
3,7,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Guys, can you hear me okay? All right. Just want to make sure you can hear me. So this has been a great call. First, congratulations on a great
quarter. It's been a great call with a lot of robust questions here. You're like, what else is there to ask? Here's my question. As we think about the
NII outlook and you highlighted the NIM pressure, but loan – but basically, balance is increasing here, right? Maybe you could just speak to –
could you help me understand the order of the drivers? Is it QT going away, deposits going up, punch it into securities? Is it loan growth
inflecting? Is there any place in the franchise where you see loan growth opportunities for inflection this coming year? And then lastly, as I think
about your comments around you've got the green market share number one, you've got the yellow, you've got the red, places maybe we can't
see. Could you help us understand where those yellows and reds are – where they are? Are they just scattered, everybody – every single
business has one? Or are there some that have more than others and, therefore, more opportunities? And is it more balance sheet or fee-
generative? That's kind of what I'd like to just discuss if you have a minute. Thanks.",2024,4
4,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Yeah, let me take a crack at that, Betsy. So, loan growth, I think looking for areas where it might inflect, the only thing I can think of,
frankly, that would be in that category, certainly in terms of being meaningful to the company's performance, would be acquisition finance
because that's been relatively muted as a a function of the M&A environment, and if that picks up you could see more there. Now, those aren't
loans that we necessarily keep on the balance sheet for that long, so whether that shows up in fees or NII or whatever, it's a separate issue. But
as you can see like on our presentation page for the NII outlook, you know that Card loan growth and revolve normalization has been a
significant tailwind. And while that is also a driver of growth in 2025, again, based on our current guess about the future, it will be – it's
decelerating a little bit, rather than the opposite.
Still growing above trend obviously, which is great, and it's a sign of the strength of the franchise and the amount of engagement that we're
getting from our Card clients, but the big normalization tailwinds there are gone. You know well the state of the mortgage market given rates.
Rates are also a headwind in some other pockets like our multifamily lending business at the margin. So, yeah, I think a higher growth
environment, a little bit more optimism, could you see a bit more loan growth in Business Banking? Could you see a bit more growth in C&I at
the margin? Yes. But I think the place where you might see inflection is more in the areas that are deal-driven, I would say. So, we'll see. We'll
see what happens there. And in terms of the reds and the ambers under the green, I think you know them, right? And they're aligned with our
big long-standing investment strategies.
The biggest single one arguably is that in what you might call the affluent section of the Wealth Management space, we are significantly
underpenetrated relative to the number of households that we bank in the country and our capabilities and our brand and what we think we
bring to the table. So, that's why we're pushing so hard on that front, because I think we can get more share there and it completes the
franchise very nicely. There are a bunch of examples elsewhere, but we talk a lot about drilling down inside the Markets business, inside
Investment Banking and finding the places where even where at the aggregate global sector level we look great and any given region and any
given subsector we can do better. And as I mentioned, we continue to look at that as aggressively as ever.",2024,4
5,7,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,Thank you.,2024,4
6,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thank you, Betsy.",2024,4
0,8,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Inc.,"Good morning. I guess just two questions. In terms of areas of vulnerability, so I heard you, Jeremy, on the lending side, but lots of
crosscurrents. Like, if we anchor to the fact that you have a new administration that's taking place or take office with a focus on domestic
CapEx. Even if we don't get any rates cut, when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of
tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yeah, would love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no
rate cuts might mean.",2024,4
1,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Oh, I see where your question is. That took me a second. Yeah, I mean, look, wholesale credit is pretty hard to predict. It tends to be very
idiosyncratic. You obviously know that we're coming out of a 10-plus year period of an exceptionally low charge-off rate, and so at some point
that has to normalize to a slightly more reasonable level, a little bit to Jamie's comments earlier about how some things are still not fully
normalized, and arguably wholesale credit could be one of those. We do run extensive stress tests on the sensitivities to the portfolio – of the
portfolio to rate shock. A lot of what we do from an underwriting perspective is designed to protect us from that, frankly. So, you can rest
assured that we're running the relevant analysis, but I'm not inclined to go into detail on any given sector or whatever. Jamie, did you want to
add?",2024,4
2,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I would just point the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment. That's both in the consumer side and it bleeds into
the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, sub-prime, credit card. So, really, it's your forecast of unemployment, which you have to make
your own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said, vulnerabilities, it's unemployment, but the worst case would
be stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board. We're not predicting that, but
you just asked where the vulnerability is, that's the vulnerability.",2024,4
3,8,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Inc.,"And I guess – thanks for that. Just sticking with that, as far as QT is concerned, when you talk to experts, like no one knows where the right level
for the Fed to end is. I'm just wondering if you have any thoughts there on when Fed should end the pressure on the system, and what it may
imply for deposit growth?",2024,4
4,8,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I think the conventional wisdom on QT, and I'm not pretending to add to the conventional wisdom one way or the other, is that the
tapering should sort of complete and, therefore, we might see an end sometime in the middle of the year. Of course, they may change that, but
that seems to be the current market consensus. And when we sort of take a step back and look at the H.8 data and our kind of flow of funds
models and that type of stuff, when you look at the way our peers are behaving, evolution of QT, expectations for economy-wide loan growth, et
cetera, and what the impact of that might be on the growth of system-wide deposits, it's kind of consistent with the story that we're telling
about sort of the background growth in our NII outlook, plus or minus, what happens with the policy rate and stabilizing and growing deposit
balances through the second half of the year.",2024,4
5,8,Ebrahim H. Poonawala,Analyst,Inc.,Thank you.,2024,4
0,9,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Hi, Jeremy. Hi, Jamie. Jeremy...",2024,4
1,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Good morning, Gerard.",2024,4
2,9,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"...you mentioned in your comments about the overall Firmwide deposits have stabilized in the second half. You could see some growth and
you're very – I think you said you started to see maybe some of that in the consumer checking deposits. We noticed in the industry data from
the regulators, household checking deposits pre-pandemic for the industry were running about $1 trillion. Now, they have remained elevated
post-pandemic at $4 trillion. Can you – based on what you're seeing in your customer base, what can you attribute the strength to in this
consumer checking account deposits?",2024,4
3,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"That's fascinating, Gerard. I’ll have to take a look at that data. I don't actually recognize those numbers. But I can speak for ourselves, which is
that when we look at the encouraging growth that we see in our checking franchise, it's a couple of things. So, of course, there was some
excess, and there was some yield-seeking behavior. So you did see people moving money out of checking into higher-yielding alternatives
over the course of the last couple of years in the rate cycle. It feels to us as if we're in the final innings of that. We're just not seeing nearly as
much yield-seeking pressure as we had seen. In the meantime, as you well know, we are aggressively engaging with clients and acquiring all
the new clients and deepening in a lot of different markets as part of our branch expansion strategy and the deepening in all of those markets.
So the combination of the tail-end of the yield-seeking flows and excellent client engagement and success in the sort of organic build out of
that franchise is starting to show up in checking account growth, which we see as a very healthy indicator for the franchise.",2024,4
4,9,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Very good. And then as a follow-up, circling back about the capital levels, you guys have been very clear about where you want them to be. Can
you share the pros and cons from JPMorgan's perspective? Not so much from an investor, but we understand, of course, you can do a share
repurchase. Obviously, you can do non-depository acquisitions with the excess capital. But what are the pros and cons of a special dividend to
reduce that excess capital if you continue with these incredible profitability levels of 20% return on tangible common equity? You're growing
your income and capital very nicely every year. But what are those pros and cons, again, from JPMorgan's perspective?",2024,4
5,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, we made some public comments on this at a conference some time back. So he'll – he wants to go. So, go ahead.",2024,4

7,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"No, no, no. You go. Seriously.",2024,4
8,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I was just going to say we're not going to do one. We have looked at it. If you all have any great insights for us, let us know, but most people
don't want it, doesn't add shareholder value. And I've never thought of having cash in your pocket as a bad thing. I think it's a huge mistake to
look at life and you have to ""deploy capital"". So we want to be very, very patient. But special dividends, if you look at the history of special
dividends, they really basically don't work.",2024,4
9,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"If anyone has a different opinion, we're always interested.",2024,4

3,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,See you next quarter.,2024,4
0,1,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Good morning, Jeremy. Wondering if you could start by just kind of amplifying just the macro commentary that you started off on. And given
the uncertainty in the world that you referenced, just how are you seeing the activity change across the customer base from consumers to
wholesale? And can you just talk through how that's also just informing any changes in your – some of your growth and reserving
expectations? Thanks.",2025,1
1,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sure, Ken. So I mean, at a high level, I would say that obviously, some of the salient news flow is quite recent. So, we've done some soundings
and some checking both on the consumer side and on the wholesale side. I think on the consumer side, the thing to check is the spending data.
And to be honest, the main thing that we see there, what would appear to be a certain amount of frontloading of spending ahead of people
expecting price increases from tariffs. So ironically, that's actually somewhat supportive, all else equal. But I think what it sort of highlights is
that during this transitional period and this elevated uncertainty, you might see some distortions in the data that make it hard to draw larger
conclusions.
In terms of our corporate clients, obviously, they've been reacting to the changes in tariff policy. And at the margin, that shifts their focus away
from more strategic priorities with obvious implications for the Investment Banking pipeline outlook towards more short-term work, optimizing
supply chains and trying to figure out how they're going to respond to the current environment. So as a result, I think we would characterize
what we're hearing from our corporate clients as a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude.
I do think you see obvious differences across sectors. Some sectors are going to be much more exposed than others and have more
complicated problems to solve. And also across the size of the clients, I think smaller clients, small business and smaller corporates are
probably a little bit more challenged. I think the larger corporates have a bit more experience dealing with these things and more resources to
manage. So that's a little bit our read of the situation right now. But certainly, a bit of a wait-and-see attitude. It's hard to make long-term
decisions right now, and so we'll see how that plays out.",2025,1
2,1,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Yeah. And just one question on the NII ex. Markets holding at $90 billion. Can you just walk us through the puts and takes of just what's the new
curve you're using, which also is subject to change every day and what might have been some of the positive offsets to if you put in more
expected cuts than you had before? Thanks.",2025,1
3,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, that's a good question, Ken. You're right. So if you remember, last quarter we said that we had one cut in the curve. I think latest curve has
something like three cuts. And so, we've talked a lot, obviously, about how we are asset sensitive. You now see our EaR disclosed in the
supplement, and probably our empirical EaR is a little bit higher than our modeled EaR as a result of the relatively low – lower than modeled
rates paid in Consumer. So when you put that together, all else equal, the drop in the weighted-average IORB, which is about 22 basis points,
should produce a notable headwind in our NII ex. Markets.",2025,1
4,1,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,In the curve basically.,2025,1
5,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah. This is basically – that's just mechanically...,2025,1
6,1,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,This is guaranteed not to happen.,2025,1
7,1,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So that's mechanically just flowing through the curve. So yeah, your question is that given that, why are you not revising down? And the answer
to that is that across all the puts and takes actually, our number is a tiny bit lower. It's just not enough to warrant a change in the outlook. But we
do have some offsets. So we have some balance effects that are favorable. You will have noted that I talked about higher wholesale deposit
balances, for example. We see beta outperforming in a couple of different places in CDs and in wholesale.
The other thing is that you'll recall, we talked before about having a placeholder in our NII outlook for the potential impact of the Card late fee
rule. We've now removed that. So that's a little bit of an offset as well. So that's kind of how you get to unchanged, even though clearly, all else
equal, the lower expected front-end rates are a headwind.",2025,1
0,2,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Yes. Good morning. This question is for Jamie. Jamie, you were on the media today talking about potential economic turbulence. But Jeremy
also mentioned that banking should be – the banking system should be a source of strength in this turbulence. The equity market always
seems to think about the banks as weaker players given how they trade the stocks more on sentiment and fear rather than the math of – the
ability of banks to absorb provisions going forward, if we do fall into a slower economic downturn.
So, I guess, just the question here is, can you double-click on how you think this is going to impact the economy going forward and maybe
double-click on Jeremy's statement that the banking system should be a source of strength?",2025,1
1,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I just – before Jamie answers that, Erika, I just want to make one brief comment, which is the banking system being a source of strength means
what it says. In other words, banks doing their job to support the economy. That's not a statement about bank equity performance and the
extent to which banks are cyclical or not. Like obviously, a recessionary environment, as I've frequently said, all else equal, is bad for banks
from an equity performance perspective. We're talking about the financial strength of banks' balance sheets and our ability to support our
clients in a difficult moment.",2025,1
2,2,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Everyone trades stocks in a different way, so sentiment – but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets
worse, credit losses will go up, volumes can change, deal curves can change. And we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our
excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him, how they're looking at their forecast today, they think it's
about 50-50 for a recession. So I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit losses will go up and other factors will change, too.
And I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is – and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am. And I think
you're going to see a lot of companies – you guys – not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P
by 5%. So it's – now it's up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that will be zero and negative 5%, probably in the next month.
And then you're going to hear 1,000 companies report, and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is a lot will remove it.
They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every
company. But I assume you'll see that. And anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And
that's M&A, that's M&A with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So people have to adjust to this new
environment. And I think we'll see what it is.
I just also want to point out, just to – so you can round it up. This is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit,
unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period of $15 billion. And then to
show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month – three quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So, just – that just sizes up a bad
recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and
serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock.",2025,1
3,2,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,"Got it. And a second follow-up question. And I don't disagree with you guys on equity market performance of bank stocks. It's just that the
mindset of portfolio managers is they always go back to sort of the lowest common denominator of fundamental performance versus thinking
about resilience.
And to that point, the second question is on the reserve. Jeremy, you mentioned a weighted-average unemployment rate of 5.8%. I think that's
above where economists are thinking we could peak even in a recession scenario. How should we think about any incremental builds from
here? And what you are going – obviously, deterioration in the outlook, but what more do you need to see in terms of how you make decisions
about further builds from here?",2025,1
4,2,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Erika, it's a good question. But the truth is there's just a little bit too much uncertainty right now for me to sort of give an outlook for
reserves, which is generally not a thing that we do anyway. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the [indiscernible] forecast at the end of
the quarter was the sort of bog standard, no landing, barely any increase in unemployment. Given that we knew at the time that there was –
there were some big pending announcements, and there was quite a bit of elevated uncertainty around that, it felt like the forecasts were kind
of lagging because people were just waiting to actually get the information and so it felt appropriate to add a little bit of downside skew to our
probability assessment, which is what led to the increase and what led to the build.
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer, JPMorganChase A
We use this weighted-average unemployment thing as a useful way to help explain what's going on inside the reserve. But obviously, the actual
mechanisms are quite complex, the depth in any financial recession, the timing of it, distribution of outcomes, which sectors have hits,
idiosyncratic stuff in wholesale. There's a lot.
I think on consumer, as Jamie mentioned, it is worth remembering that by far the most important variable is unemployment. So if the labor
market remains very strong, consumer credit will probably be fine. If it doesn't, then you're going to see it play through the way it always does.",2025,1
5,2,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,Thank you.,2025,1
0,3,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Erika.",2025,1
0,4,John McDonald,Analyst,Truist Securities Inc.,"Hi, good morning. Jeremy, on that same topic, no change to the full year credit Card net charge-off forecast. How do we square that with the
rising recession risk? Is it because you already have a couple of months of delinquencies kind of baked in the cake and this is more an issue for
next year, or just too early to call?",2025,1
1,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,We should have not given you that forecast. We don't know what the number is going to be. That's a...,2025,1
2,4,John McDonald,Analyst,Truist Securities Inc.,Yeah.,2025,1
3,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I would say that's a short-term number, and based on what's happening today, there's a wide range of potential outcomes.",2025,1
4,4,John McDonald,Analyst,Truist Securities Inc.,"Yeah. Okay. Okay, yeah, that's what we were kind of thinking. And then...",2025,1
5,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"But, mechanically, John, though, as you alluded to, there are some mechanical elements to the way Card charge-off works that means that it's
pretty baked pretty far ahead of time.",2025,1
6,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,The next couple of quarters. Yeah.,2025,1
7,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"So, sort of echoing Jamie's point, it just doesn't necessarily tell you that much about what might actually happen through the end of the year.
Even if unemployment were to increase significantly, it probably wouldn't flow through the charge-offs until later.",2025,1
8,4,John McDonald,Analyst,Truist Securities Inc.,"Okay. Got it. And then just on capital, how does this type of macro uncertainty impact your thinking around conserving capital as opposed to
deploying it through your investment agenda and buybacks as the stock gets cheaper? Or just, are you still looking to arrest the increase or
does this kind of change it?",2025,1
9,4,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"The investment that we do in banks, branches, technology, AI is going to continue regardless of the environment. And then we have –
depending what happens to Basel III and CCAR and G-SIFI and all that, $30 billion to $60 billion of excess capital. And in the Chairman's letter, I
wrote about what we think of that. But based upon the environment, the turbulence issues, I like having excess capital. We are prepared for any
environment. And that's so we can serve clients. That's not for any other reason. So, we have plenty of capital and plenty of liquidity to get
through whatever the stormy seas are.",2025,1
10,4,John McDonald,Analyst,Truist Securities Inc.,Okay. Thank you.,2025,1
11,4,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Thanks John.,2025,1
0,5,Matt O’Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Good morning. Just wanted to drill down on the credit card spend. Any comments in terms of changing patterns on the consumer card spend?
There's been headlines in travel kind of going down. Just talk about some of the puts and takes in that up 7% year-over-year.",2025,1
1,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, it's a good question and we're seeing that too. So let me talk about travel. I mean we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are
seeing as headwinds for them, specifically in airline travel, and we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's
necessarily an indicator for broader patterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend.
And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading
of spending, specifically in items that might be – have prices go up as a function of tariffs. So you see people behaving rationally, and I have
noted even you hear anecdotes, and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising we have pre-tariff inventory and so on and so
forth. So it's not that surprising that you're seeing that a little bit in the spending data.
The other thing that people are kind of interested in this space is like what's happening by income band, because we have seen some of the
retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower income segment. And I think when we look at our Card data and also our cash
buffers and peoples' checking accounts, of course, it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower income segment. But when you take a step
back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the margin and cash buffers are
lower, and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments. But actually, some of
the increases in spending that we're seeing in April are actually coming from the lower income segment. So no evidence of distress, I would
say.",2025,1
2,5,Matt O’Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Okay. That's helpful color. And then just separately, if we look at the delinquencies for the Home Lending, the increase both quarter-on-quarter
and year-over-year, is that just some of the noise from the First Republic deal as you take the marks upfront and then those portfolios
essentially re-season from an accounting point of view? Or is there something else going on there?",2025,1
3,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Sorry, the – I actually didn't hear. Which fees?",2025,1
4,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Delinquencies in Home Lending.,2025,1
5,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,I didn't – interesting. I haven't looked at that. We'll have to get back to you on that,2025,1
6,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,I don't think it's anything...,2025,1
7,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Whatever it is, it wasn't important enough to get raised, so.",2025,1
8,5,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"It could be the First Republic accounting, yes",2025,1
9,5,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah. Anything is possible. We'll get back to you on that.,2025,1
10,5,Matt O’Connor,Analyst,Inc.,Okay. Thank you.,2025,1
0,6,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to start off with one on the proposed SLR changes and just the impact of rate
volatility. The Treasury is committed to providing relief to the banks under the SLR just to help mitigate some of the volatility in the 10-year. But
given the geopolitical concerns, weakening global demand for treasuries, how does it inform your appetite just for purchasing U.S. Treasuries
if those reforms are implemented and just how you're managing rate risk maybe more holistically across the Firm, just in light of some the
recent volatility?",2025,1
1,6,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yes. So SLR alone isn't going to change that much for us. It may change for other people. We really need reform across SLR, G-SIFI, CCAR,
Basel III and LCR, all of which have deep flaws in them to make a material change. And remember, it's not relief to the banks; it's relief to the
markets. JPMorgan will be fine with/without an SLR change. The reason to change some of these things is so banks – the big market makers
could intermediate more in the markets. If they don't – if they do, spreads will come in, there'll be more active traders. If they don't, the Fed will
have to intermediate, which I think is just a bad policy idea that every time there's a kerfuffle in the markets, the Fed has to come in and
intermediate. So they should make these changes.
The point – the reason why is when you have very – a lot of volatile markets and very wide spreads and low liquidity in treasuries, it affects all
other capital markets. That's the reason to do it; not as a favor to the banks themselves. And we don't take more interest rate exposure to this
in any way, shape or form. So it's not like we're going to change our position. We intermediate in the markets to help clients do what they have
to do. And if the banks could take bigger positions, they would have just larger dealer positions and take no – basically take not much more
interest rate exposure. I should say that our folks did a fabulous job trading this quarter.",2025,1
2,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And Steve, all I would add to that is that it is, of course, true, and we all remember the moment a few years ago when intermediaries were, in
fact, bound by SLR as a result of the expansion of the deposit base, and extraordinary actions needed to be taken to address that. So we've
seen when it is binding, and it works not as designed, which is why we do very much agree that it should be fixed. I think our point is a little bit,
as Jamie said in his Chairman's letter, that it's not the only thing that needs to be fixed, and there are interactions among all these things. And
we, as a bank, are not particularly bound by it.
There is some interesting nuance too in terms of the potential TLAC issuance impact there, which is quite sensitive to which particular fix gets
put in. So that will be an interesting thing to watch.",2025,1
3,6,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,"Thank you both for that perspective. And just for my follow-up, did want to ask on the Markets outlook. So, admittedly, less surprising to hear
some of the cautious IB commentary in light of the uncertainty. But was hoping you could just speak to the Markets businesses which have
been performing extraordinarily well of late and just given the combination of elevated volatility, but also some indications that clients are
taking down risk, how you expect that business to perform over the coming quarters.",2025,1
4,6,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. It's a good question. As you know, Steve, we're obviously not going to give Markets guidance. Your guess is as good as ours at some
level. But the ingredients are the right ingredients. I mean, we've often discussed about how this business, all else equal, benefits from a volatile
environment if markets are operating relatively normally, which they more or less have been. Of course, it's not guaranteed. We need to do a
good job managing the risk. And yeah, there are states of the world where if our clients are struggling or deleveraging or taking down risk, that
could be a headwind for us. So we're going to just do what we always do and try to manage the risk well and serve our clients, but we were
certainly happy to see the performance this quarter.",2025,1
5,6,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research LLC,That's great. Thank you both for taking my questions.,2025,1
0,7,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Thank you. Hi, Jeremy and Jamie. Can you guys share with us – if you take a look at the non-traditional lenders, private credit lenders, they've
been very active in grabbing market share from the traditional commercial banks over the last two or three years, particularly since the initial
Basel III Endgame proposal came out in July of 2023, which is no longer applicable. But are you guys seeing any opportunities where
customers may re-intermediate back into the banks like your bank because of this volatility?",2025,1
1,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I mean that's hard to tell, Gerard. I think it's too early to tell. But what I would say is that it kind of – your question aligns with what we've been
saying about this space for some time, which is we want to be product agnostic here and give our clients the best option that makes sense for
them in the moment. Whether that's a traditional syndicated lending facility or something that looks more like a unitranche, direct lending type
structure, we're open for business for all of it.
And I would say that when we talk about the financial system being a source – the banking system being a source of strength in this
environment, part of what we're talking about is our commitment and willingness to lend through cycles, as we've always done in the past and
that we have the underwriting capability and the capital and the liquidity and the experience to be reliable lenders in serving our clients no
matter what type of environment we're in. So, if that means that we have an opportunity to compete incrementally even more effectively in this
environment, that will be great.",2025,1
2,7,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,"Very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up, you both just talked about the potential changes to the different regulatory outcomes for you
and your peers, whether it's SLR or the G-SIB buffer, et cetera. Can you opine for us your views? Are you more confident with the new
administration, the new personnel, whether it's Treasury Secretary Bessent or others, the nominees for different regulatory heads that there
will be a better chance of real regulatory reform, they see it the way you guys do versus the prior administration?",2025,1
3,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, I mean, Gerard, we always say this, and it's true, which is that we work with all administrations and every administration as constructively
as possible to express our opinions and advocate for the things that we think are right for the banking system and for the economy as a whole,
and that was true before, and it's true now with this administration as well.
Clearly, the administration has been quite vocal about wanting more pro-growth policies at the margin and for wanting to make it easier for
banks to participate more constructively in the economy. And as we see the various folks and the various agencies go through the
confirmation process, it will be helpful to have people in seats and get to work on some of the things that we want to get done. So let's see how
that plays out, but we're looking forward to continuing to engage constructively.",2025,1
4,7,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I think there's a deep recognition of the flaws in the system, and there should be, and fortunately, they're going to take a good look at it.",2025,1
5,7,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,Very good. Thank you.,2025,1
6,7,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Gerard.",2025,1
0,8,Ebrahim Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Thank you. Good morning. I guess just wanted to follow up on the macro uncertainty. I think when you talk to investors, we've gone from
enthusiasm for a pro-business administration to a lot of headwinds. And I think Jamie mentioned you'll have companies take down guidance, et
cetera, potentially over the coming weeks. I'm just wondering what is it you think we need to see before this uncertainty abates, or the 90-day
pause that we saw with some of the other countries on tariffs. Is that enough? Or I'm just wondering when you talk to clients, corporate CEOs,
what are they looking for from the administration that would inject confidence to get back anywhere close to where we were maybe 60 or 90
days ago?",2025,1
1,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"First of all, some of all the issues that are raised existed before the new administration, like the geopolitical situation, the excess fiscal deficits,
poorly done regulations and all that. Obviously, pro-growth is good, pro-business is good, pro-dereg is good. I think the best thing to do is to
allow the Secretary of Treasury and the folks working with him and the administration to finish as quick as possible the agreements that they
need to make with – around tariffs and with our trading partners. And I think there'll be agreements in principle. They're not going to be – trade
agreements themselves would be 5,000 or 10,000 pages long. And that's the best way to go about it right now. That does not mean you won't
have some of the effects take place anyway.",2025,1
2,8,Ebrahim Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,"Got it. I guess as a follow up, I think there's a lot of concern also in the treasury markets. We've seen the 10-year move from 3.99% to 4.50% in a
matter of a week. Just your comfort level on terms of the functioning of the treasury market. Do you see the Fed stepping in, pausing QT,
maybe even initiating some treasury purchases? Just any color would be great.",2025,1
3,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. But again, I mean, we have sticky inflation. We had that before. I personally have told you all, I don't think that's going to go away, and that
relates to that. Obviously, the U.S. dollar still is the reserve currency, and that isn't going to change, though some people may feel slightly
differently about it. And the Fed – we've been inconsistent. There will be a kerfuffle of the treasury markets because of all the rules and
regulations. I've told you that consistently. It happened in COVID, it happened before, it happened. That will happen. And then when that
happens, the Fed will step in. That's what happens. And they're not going to do it now because you don't have all those issues yet. They'll do it
when they start to panic a little bit, and we don't know if and when that's going to happen, and we'll see.
But the notion that the 10-year Treasury has to go down is a false notion. If we look at history in prior times, when we have huge global deficits.
Back in the '70s, in the '60s, the guns and butter. And tariffs, at least our economists think will be inflationary to 0.5% or something like that. So
we'll have to wait and see and deal with it.",2025,1
4,8,Ebrahim Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,Thank you.,2025,1
5,8,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"For most – mostly haven't dealt with this stuff before, and you're going to see a lot of stuff taking place shortly in the next couple of months, and
then we'll know.",2025,1
6,8,Ebrahim Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,Got it. Thank you so much.,2025,1
0,9,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Hey, good morning. Jeremy, just on – with four – three to four cuts sort of mostly in the back half, June to December, how do you think about
the trajectory of NII this year? Is there a little more pressure towards the end of the year into 2026? Just trying to think of that around that
trajectory and jumping off point into next year.",2025,1
1,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yes. It's funny, Jim, because I was asked on the press call, how come we're not like suspending guidance or whatever? And my answer was
like...",2025,1
2,9,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,Right.,2025,1
3,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"...well, whatever. We give guidance and we do our best, and it's contingent on a variety of external variables, and we always make our guidance
contingent on that. So in that context...",2025,1
4,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,and the yield curve you're using...,2025,1
5,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, yeah, yeah.",2025,1
6,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,...which we know will not happen.,2025,1
7,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And the particular nuance, as you'll recall from last quarter, where we went into some detail about the various drivers of the NII outlook,
including a little bit of a suggestion about the quarterly trajectory is that it's both the timing of rates and the – our expected evolution of deposit
growth in the different businesses and how card revolve and how that was all going to interact, producing a potential trough in different
moments and then so on and so forth.
I think that given everything that's going on on that one, probably we'll wait for next quarter to give you any more color on that. Certainly, the
back-loaded cuts, all else equal, from a run-rate perspective, introduced a little bit of a headwind on an exit rate going into next year. We'll just
have to see how the balances play out through the next three quarters.",2025,1
8,9,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,Right. And maybe just to...,2025,1
9,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"It will not happen that way, and we have a lot of options in what we want to do to change our exposure to interest rate.",2025,1
10,9,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,"Right. And maybe just on that point on volumes and deposits, obviously, this kind of volatility tends to drive – as corporates and investors go to
cash, tends to drive higher deposits. Did you see that trend in March and particularly in April? What are the trends like in the deposit side of the
equation?",2025,1
11,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"It’s a little hard to tell, to be honest. It is true that wholesale deposits this quarter outperformed for us relative to our expectations. I don't think I
can say with any confidence that that's a result of the environment that we're in. So I think next quarter will probably be a better time to assess
that.",2025,1
12,9,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I'll just – I'll say it may not be deposits. It may be treasury bills or various other things. And what you've seen which is different, it's not the risk
off trade in the 10-year. That is fundamentally different this time.",2025,1
13,9,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global Securities LLC,Right. Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.,2025,1
14,9,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Thanks.,2025,1
0,10,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Thanks. Good morning, Jamie. Good morning, Jeremy. Two questions. One for Jamie, just to kick off.",2025,1
1,10,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Good morning.,2025,1
2,10,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Jamie, you've been through many cycles. And I think we're all interested in understanding how you think this next cycle is likely to progress.
And I'm wondering, is there anything that you've seen in the past that looks like this, or that you would suggest if any slowdown coming
forward, is it more likely to be similar to what kind of prior cycle you've seen?",2025,1
3,10,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"An almost impossible answer. We look at all the cycles. And you know we prepare for a full range of outcomes. We're not – I don't personally
like predicting what the future is going to hold. But I do – I've pointed out over and over, there's a lot of issues out there. I think some of those
issues, you are going to see them resolve, for better or for worse, in the next four months.
So maybe when we're doing this call next quarter, we won't have to be guessing. We'll actually know what the effect of some of these things was
with some predictability and stuff like that. But it's – the result in a bank is almost always the same, which is volatile markets, credit losses go
up, people get more conservative, investments go down, what looks like a recession. Is it mild or hard? I don't know and – but we are – I've been
quite cautious, and you can see in our capital, our liquidity, our position, our balance sheet. And so we're prepared. But we do all that so we can
Jamie Dimon

serve our clients through thick or thin. We're not guessing about what the future is going to hold. Obviously, if you look at our numbers, we
have the margins and capability to get through just about anything.",2025,1
4,10,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Excellent. Okay. No, thank you for that. And then...",2025,1
5,10,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"But Betsy, this is different, okay? This is different. This is the global economy, and please read my Chairman's Letter. The most important thing
to me is the Western world stays together economically when we get through all this and militarily to keep the world safe and free for
democracy. That is the most important thing. I really almost don't care fundamentally about what the economy does in the next two quarters.
That isn't that important. We'll get through that. We've had recessions before and all that. It's the ultimate outcome. What's the goal? How can
we get there? And it's literally that. I mean – and the China issue is a major issue. I don't know how that's going to turn out. We obviously have to
follow the law of the land, but it's a significant change that we've never seen in our lives.",2025,1
6,10,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Okay. Thank you so much for that. And yes, looking forward to the next four months and clarity coming. So then one for Jeremy. Question on
the wholesale loans. I'm going into this because I noticed your average loan growth, I think it was running at about 2% year-on-year. And then
end of period loans was up 5% and wholesale loans was up 7%. So I'm just wondering if there was some line drawdowns at quarter end. And it's
a broader question on just liquidity. Do you see your customers looking for more liquidity? Are they drawing down lines? And maybe if you
could speak to liquidity in the front end of the market, that would be helpful, too. Thank you.",2025,1
7,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, it's a good question, Betsy. So a couple of things. One is in our soundings of our wholesale clients during sort of the moments of peak
uncertainty, we did hear them talking about wanting to focus on shoring up liquidity. Interestingly, I actually asked the question like a day ago,
whether we were seeing draws, meaningfully observable draws from clients. And the answer to that question was no, at least not yet. So, I don't
know what to make of that, but perhaps it suggests that we do not see that level of heightened anxiety that people are more just focusing on
addressing their supply chain issues right now. Yeah. So on wholesale loans.
Beyond that, I don't think there's that much of a story. Now we're seeing a bit more growth in sort of like Markets loans as opposed to traditional
C&I loans in the current moment, but that's neither here nor there. Did you have – yeah, you asked – what did you ask also, front end of the yield
curve, liquidity?",2025,1
8,10,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"Yes, just in...",2025,1
9,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Was that your question?,2025,1
10,10,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,"...money markets, Fed funds, the front end seemed to suggest...",2025,1
11,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Yeah. What we've heard from our Markets colleagues is that that's actually functioning quite smoothly.,2025,1
12,10,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,Okay. Thank you.,2025,1
13,10,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,Thanks,2025,1
0,11,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Well Fargo Securities LLC,"Hey, Jamie, you just said on this call, there's a ""Deep recognition of flaws"" by the new regulatory regime. And can you put – you or Jeremy, put
some meat on the bones as far as what's been an ideal scenario? You keep the safety and soundness of the system, but you rid all – as much
red tape and bureaucracy as possible. How much could expenses potentially decline? I assume you pass on some of that to customers and
you'd keep some of that, and the regulators would save money. So, some meat on the bones about the potential concrete savings from
deregulation.
But before that, the negative, which you highlight in the press release and the Chairman Letter about trade wars, Jamie, you went from trade
wars ""Get over it"" to this week say, ""Do something."" So just as far as the tariff journey, what were you initially expecting to what happened and
do you really think next earnings call we'll be through most of the uncertainty? Thanks.",2025,1
1,11,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. No, I don't think we'll necessarily be through all the uncertainty. I think you'll just know a lot more. And my quote was about, get over it. I
wish I hadn't said it. I was specifically referring to tariffs relating to protecting national security. National security is paramount. All things
should be subordinated to it. You may need tariffs to help fix some of the problems related to national security. National security is a small part
of trade, so – and it's rare earths, penicillin, medical ingredients, certain types of – obviously, you've heard about semiconductors. That was my
quote about, get over it. I did not change my view about it.
I would like to see the administration negotiate trade deals. I think they'll be good for everybody, and they want to do it too. They've said they
want to do it. They've said they're having conversations with 70, 80 different people. And so I do think if the regulators change regulations, it
will free up capital and liquidity to finance the system. And I don't – I wouldn't expect an expense drawdown that you're going to see. There will
be thousands – hundreds of people, maybe, but it's not going to be passed on. But it will reduce net-net the cost of liquidity and the cost of
loans and the cost of mortgages, if it's done right.
I specifically pointed out the mortgage issue in my Chairman's letter this year about if they do some of these reforms, the cost of mortgages
would come down 70 basis points. If I were them, I'd be focusing on that right now.",2025,1
2,11,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Well Fargo Securities LLC,"No, and you also mentioned hundreds of billions of dollars of extra lending if you reduce the CET1 ratio, I guess, back down by one-fifth.",2025,1
3,11,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"If you do all – you have to fix LCR, G-SIFI, CCAR, SLR, and I think would free up hundreds of billions of dollars for JPMorgan annually of various
types of lending to the system. Some would be markets, some would be middle market loans, et cetera. And I pointed out, if you wanted to look
at the big numbers, that loans to deposits are now 70% for the banking system writ large. That used to be 100%, and the reason for that isn't –
it's not just capital. It is also LCR, it is also G-SIFI, also – and the question you should ask because you are very smart, Mike, is could you have
the same – and I believe you have a safer system, lend more money, have more liquidity, eliminate bank runs, eliminate what happened to First
Republic and Silicon Valley, and you could accomplish all of that with completely rational and thoughtful regulations. That's what I would like to
see them do. I don't know what's going to happen. We're going to...",2025,1
4,11,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Well Fargo Securities LLC,One short...,2025,1
5,11,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"You can read our – I think our NPRs are public and stuff like that. And so they should do that. Just make a better system. Or you have the best in
the world. We've kind of started to cripple it slowly. If you don't – I'd say, you look at these rules and regulations. See Europe. If that's where we
want to go. Let's just go there.",2025,1
6,11,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Well Fargo Securities LLC,"One short follow-up. Just first quarter, you mentioned good credit, good trading, good EPS beat. I'm not sure anyone cares. They're worried
more about the things we're talking about here. But in terms of the risk of being an international company, an international U.S. company
during trade wars. And I know JPMorgan is a firm that likes to partner with countries as well as communities and customers. So how do you
think about that risk? How should we think about that risk? And hopefully, your voice is being heard to speed things along to whatever can be
done, getting it done because you could be in the crosshairs at some point.",2025,1
7,11,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I honestly add that to the list of worries. We will be in the crosshairs. That's what's going to happen. And it's okay. We're deeply
embedded in these other countries, people like us. But I do think some clients or some countries will feel differently about American banks, and
we'll just have to deal with that.",2025,1
8,11,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Well Fargo Securities LLC,All right. Thank you.,2025,1
0,12,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,"Hi. Just one follow-up on this whole risk management/regulatory front. I see, I hear and I agree: flawed regulatory system, could be better.
We've had massive volatility. The market plumbing has held in okay so far and you and others have had borderline spectacular trading results.
So, has something changed? Are the systems better? Are they better able to handle your risk management, your people, the diversity of your
platform better? Or are there still environments where not all volatility is good? Just curious to get your big picture thoughts. Thanks.",2025,1
1,12,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"I mean, maybe I'll start with that one, Glenn. So, I guess, I think that your points aren't mutually exclusive. Meaning, I mean, we're always
continually improving the franchise. We've talked a lot about inward investment in all of our businesses, including Markets. And so we try to be
more complete and invest in technology and work more closely with our clients. So I'm sure we're kind of better at it than we were five years
ago, as I think probably everyone is at the margin. I'm not sure that you can associate that with the current performance. I think these just
happen to be very favorable conditions that we've managed very successfully.
And to your point, I think your specific question of like is there – are there still forms of volatility that can be bad for the Markets franchise? The
answer to that question is definitely yes. When you have gappy volatility with no trading volume, people paralyzed, clients unsure what to do,
active managers struggling, those environments are bad. So people make fun of the kind of good volatility, bad volatility story, but whether we
like it or not, it's real. And in the end, we just have to manage the risks and serve the clients. And as I said earlier, we're happy to see that...",2025,1
2,12,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Jeremy – I agree. Jeremy, I would add to that. Volatility leads to bigger bid-ask spreads, that, all things being equal, is better. And it leads
sometimes to higher volumes. So you've seen really high volumes in FX and interest rate swaps, a whole bunch of different things, treasuries.
That's better. But as Jeremy pointed out, sometimes that kind of volatility leads to very low volumes, like you see in DCM today when you don't
have these bond deals where you have less trading, when you have – so it will have lower volumes in certain markets and stuff like that. And
how it all filters through is almost impossible to tell. But our folks do a great job and we're here to help our clients. So we know that volumes can
go up or down and spreads can go up or down.
But the plumbing of the system, I would say the plumbing worked well during COVID too. I mean, it wasn't the plumbing that was a problem and
wasn't even a problem to go back to some of the real crises we've had, so – but you should always worry about that kind of thing, make sure it
stays true.",2025,1
3,12,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"And I do think that the fact that the revenue performance in this quarter is good shouldn't make us lose focus on the importance of the larger
fixes around financial resource deployment by regulated banks to supporting the capital markets ecosystem. Everything Jamie's been talking
about SLR, LCR, ILST, G-SIB, Basel III Endgame, RWA, the whole panoply of items, which interacts, as we've often talked about and is miss-
calibrated, it will, at the margin, make it harder for banks to serve a stabilizing function in a difficult moment. So that remains quite important as
a policy priority.",2025,1
4,12,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,That's a great point. Thanks for that. Appreciate it.,2025,1
5,12,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Thanks, Glenn.",2025,1
0,13,Saul Martinez,Analyst,Inc.,"Okay. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess I'll ask about costs
since nobody has asked it. But I guess how should we think about the cost structure and any sort of cost optimization efforts, if you do see a
revenue slowdown, but not necessarily a severe downturn? I think you do have, in the $95 billion guidance, you do have a good amount of
growth penciled in for investing in bankers and branches and tech and marketing. And I guess, do you – does it make sense or under what
conditions would it make sense for you to maybe pull back on some of these investments? Or do you think that's just completely shortsighted
unless we see a real significant downturn in the economy.",2025,1
1,13,Jeremy Barnum,Chief Financial Officer,JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So you've slightly answered your own question there, Saul, but it is nonetheless a good question. So let me unpack it a little bit. So the
way I think about it is there are some elements of the expense base which automatically reset as a function of the business environment. So we
talk about those as volume- and revenue-related expenses. So you will see those come down as a function of the environment. It's also true
that there are conceivably certain investment business cases, which depending on how the environment changes, could no longer make sense
analyzed in the same way that we analyze them originally, i.e., through the lens of their ability to generate long-term shareholder value through
a long investment cycle. And so if for whatever reason the environment changes in such a way as to make certain of those investments less
compelling, we would obviously adjust.
Of course, the thing that we're not going to do is stop investing in things that we still think are very compelling to our traditional long-term
investment lens, simply for the purposes of achieving a cosmetic reduction in expenses in an environment where you may or may not have a
reduction in revenues for unrelated reasons. As you well know, that's just not how we run the company.
This quarter, as it happens, a question you might have is how are you managing to keep your guidance the same with what you're saying about,
for example, the Investment Banking outlook? But it's worth noting that Investment Banking performance this quarter was actually fine. As you
know, Markets performance was very strong. And there are also some ups and downs in there, I should note, including the fact that there is
some sensitivity to the expense base to the strength of the dollar, or weakness in this case. And while some of that is offset in revenue, it's a
little noisy, so that's a factor as well. It's small, but I'm just highlighting that there's some slightly non-obvious things that are non-strategic,
obviously.",2025,1
2,13,Jamie Dimon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Officer",JPMorgan Chase & Co.,"Can I just add a management thing that I think is very important. And I always talk about good expenses and bad expenses and the good
expenses of the bankers and branches that we think will pay off and – but there are also bad expenses, which I would put in the category of
bureaucracy, lack of efficiency, things you don't need to do.
And you can – if you go to – if you read my Chairman's letter, the last section is called Management Learnings. And if you look at companies
that over time fail, it's almost always bureaucracy, complacency, arrogance and lack of attention to detail. And so there is – we're making a – I
shouldn't say it, but I'm mad at myself for not doing it sooner to spend a little more time that after COVID – the buildup in headcount, the
buildup in rules and regulations, the people working or not working from home. After all of those things, we just think there's more efficiency
here.
And I think some of the – and Mike Mayo mentioned the bit about regulation. He is right. There will be reductions in cost because rules and
regulations will be modified a little bit. I mean we – I pointed out resolution/recovery, which is a complete waste of time, is 80,000 pages long.
Okay. It will never happen that way. CCAR, which is virtually a waste of time, is 20,000 pages long. Okay. We report 1 trillion – I think it's 1 trillion
bits of data every day or something like that to the – all the various regulators and stuff like that. There is this excessive cost built up that we –
that hopefully we can get rid of and will reduce the cost of the system and – but it's not the new branches, so.

And the folks here are working on, we call it, streamlining. Jenn Piepszak has got a war room going on it. We already have a significant amount
of saves and stuff like that, so – and we're having fun doing it. It's like – to me, it's like exercising and eating your spinach. It's what we should be
doing. We haven't done it for a while, so – and I apologize to my shareholders for not having done this a little bit sooner.",2025,1
