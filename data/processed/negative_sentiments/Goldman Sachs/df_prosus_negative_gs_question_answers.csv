3,6,Devin Ryan,Analyst,Citizens JMP,question," okay . terriﬁc. thanks for the color . quick follow-up just on the operating leverage in the model and maybe just starting on comp ratio. i know it's very the year , so it's hard to give much of a prediction. but comp ratio net provision was 100 basis points lower than the ﬁrst quarter of last year , even with, i would say , kind of an unfavorable mix. so is there anything we should read into that just around kind of how to think about the full year and just overall leverage on comp relative to revenues based on the current backdrop?",1,2022,0.7751936316490173,negative
2,0,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore,question," okay . very much appreciated. and then one quick follow-up, obviously , ecm and dcm pipelines are down a lot given what we have seen. but you noted that your advisory backlog is actually up. i wonder if you could expand on that a little bit, because we haven’t seen a lot of activity these days in m&a? thanks.",2,2022,0.804909348487854,negative
0,4,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo,question," hi, i guess i’m thinking in terms of the trade-of fs that you have to make, david, in terms of both capital and expenses. on capital, i mean, you talked about a broader , diverse, resilient, more annuity-like business stream, but then we get the fed stress test results and you guys ﬁnished in last place, albeit better than last year but still last place. so i guess the regulators don’t see it the same way that you do. and the trade-of f between managing for lower regulatory capital requirements versus the loss of revenues. and then the other dynamic decision is managing expenses lower . as you said you’re taking a closer look at that, the trade-of f between ensuring good proﬁt margins but at the risk of maybe losing revenues if things come back.",2,2022,0.5138037204742432,negative
1,5,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so two components to your question. and obviously , we manage the ﬁrm to an efﬁciency ratio, looking at both the comp side and the non-comp side of the equation meaning as you would have seen through the ﬁrst half of the year , we’ve taken compensation expense down signiﬁcantly , $3.5 billion less comp expense in the ﬁrst half versus the ﬁrst half last year . and at the same time, we did see some increases on the non-compensation side of the equation. as we look forward into the second half, as we indicated, yes, slow velocity of hiring, decreased replacement of attrition, probably reinstating our annual performance review of our employee base at the end of the year , something that we suspended during the period of the pandemic for the most part and just being much more disciplined and focused on utilization efﬁciency of our human capital resources, given overall environment. and you’re right, some of that will take time to reﬂect itself through the p&l. so i think that’ s the right expectation. you are correct in anticipating that we’re also looking at non-compensation expenses and taking some actions there as well to slow the rate of growth and reduce certain components of our non- compensation expense. some of them are – dovetail well with investments that we’re making to grow the ﬁrm. and some of those activities will obviously look to continue. we may slow the pace, but we will continue to grow the activities that support the growth of the ﬁrm. and there are other items in non-compensation expense, occupancy as an example or travel expenses, where we actually see the impact of inﬂation, impacting on the overall level of expense. and so that’ s just going to require us to work harder to manage towards our overall efﬁciency target, which is i think the comments and references that both david and i have made with respect to our orientation on the expense front.",2,2022,0.4981035590171814,negative
2,5,Brennan Hawken,Analyst,UBS,question," okay , great. thanks for that color , denis. appreciate it. and for the second question, i am curious, we have seen – you talked a lot about m&a  and how , obviously , your investment bank franchise is holding up really well. but just sort of a question around the environment and we have seen riskier debt issuance slow a lot year-to-date and started to hear chatter that availability has actually continued to become challenging. so, curious whether or not that’ s also what you are seeing and whether or not there is any concern that, that availability , lesser availability might become a challenge and lead to some pockets of stress for some of the more levered borrowers?",2,2022,0.7605715394020081,negative
2,6,Devin Ryan,Analyst,Citizens JMP,question," okay , great. thanks. and then a follow-up here, denis just touched on this, but we heard a lot about trading client deleveraging through the second quarter that drove down prime brokerage and margin balances at a number of ﬁrms in the industry . it didn’t seem to impact your trading or ﬁnancing results. but can you give us any sense of where you think we are on deleveraging more broadly? is there another leg that could exist here or clients now operating at lower levels of leverage relative to recent history and how that interplays with your trading outlook as well?",2,2022,0.7742505669593811,negative
3,10,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC,question," very good. and just as a follow-up, maybe you guys can give us a little deeper color into the ecm business. obviously , according to the dealogic numbers, the ﬁrst six months of this year , we all know were very weak and market conditions, we recognize as being the driver . but david, you alluded to maybe the price expectations are coming down. w as it primarily just the volatility that pushed everybody to the sideline? w as it lower valuations that pushed them there? what did you guys see as the biggest drivers for these really weak numbers for the industry , not just for you folks?",2,2022,0.7916961908340454,negative
4,10,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. it’ s – i think it’ s a combination, gerard, of all those things. you had a meaningful decrease in values in the public market and in the private market. you also had real volatility . and so people go down the road, doing an ipo, it’ s like a tanker . it’s heading down the road. it takes months and months and months of preparation, sometimes years of preparation. and you get your mind and you get with all the shareholders that you are going to go public at a particular value, a particular price. and all of a sudden, the value of the price is 20% or 30% less and the whole tanker just stops. they can’t turn on a dime and get everybody’ s mind reset. and so i think a shift in valuations and that volatility had a big impact. the period in terms of the anemic nature of equity capital markets issuance kind of reminds me of the period in 2002, where we obviously had enormous growth in equity capital markets activity in 1999, 2000, 2001. and then in march 2001, you started to see a real change in market and valuation. it was the beginning of a decline in the nasdaq, where the nasdaq ultimately went down 85%. i am not saying that that’ s going to happen again here. but really , equity issuance shutof f in late 2001 and 2002 was a really , really anemic year for equity issuance and started picking back up again in 2003. and so there is a reset process with all of this. and i think we are on the journey of people’ s expectation around valuations being reset.",2,2022,0.5815638303756714,negative
0,11,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global,question," hey. good morning. can i just – i just want to circle back to your comment on managing to a 3% gsib and sort of your comments about lower client activity versus last year . but i think on the ﬂip side, you guys are pretty optimistic around growing – still growing the ﬁnancing business. it looks like trading assets are up year-over-year or ﬂat year-over-year . loans are up, balance sheet is up. so, is this just something about balance sheet and r wa growth slowing or is there speciﬁc areas you think will shrink or you can cut?",2,2022,0.705302894115448,negative
1,12,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," i would say , dan, at the moment, at a high macro level, we are not seeing signiﬁcant change in behavior . when you look at the institutional capital allocators around the world, the institutional capital allocators have signiﬁcant allocations. obviously , if the overall value of the portfolio has decreased, the allocation percentage would shift, and so that will slow down capital raising. but i think for leading big global platforms that are multiproduct and global, i still think there is a secular growth trend around alternatives that’ s very , very attractive probably not at the exact same pace and that you saw in 2021, but certainly a strong secular growth trend that kind of moves forward with respect to allocations of capital by big institutional allocators into the space. i would say one of the places that a number of participants in the market, we have not been as big a participant, but there has been a lot of retail ﬂow into the alternative space. and there my insight there is that is slowing, but it’ s not turned of f and it’ s still adequate. and from what i can see in our private wealth lens that we have with a very , very high-end private wealth business, there is still signiﬁcant interest in alternatives as people move forward, so something to watch. if the environment got much worse, may be that would change, but at the moment, not seeing indications that the changes are meaningful.",2,2022,0.575985848903656,negative
4,0,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," glenn, thank you -- thanks for the question on r wa. as you note, our r was were down slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis. w e have been focused on managing our r wa footprint tightly . within that number , you'll see reductions in terms of market-based r was and increases in credit r was. and we're being very thoughtful about the way in which we allocate and deploy r wa capacity to drive efﬁciencies as well as scale franchise growth activities. and ficc ﬁnancing happens to represent an attractive opportunity in terms of our r wa deployment. and so that's one of the reasons why you see the ongoing focus in the growth of the ficc ﬁnancing line.",3,2022,0.6104260683059692,negative
1,6,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," brennan, i'll take that for you. thanks for the question. as david indicated earlier , we remain very committed to our ﬁrm-wide targets, and we're going to look to achieve them over the medium term. the efﬁciency ratio is one of those. w e will not necessarily hit that target each and every year . this is probably one of those years. it's not been a top quartile environment for performance. but that being said, we are pulling the levers that we can pull. you'll note that our compensation and beneﬁts on a year-to-date basis is down 21%. and we're going to make sure that we size that to account for our performance in line with our pay per performance orientation but also with respect to our targets. and ﬁnally , remaining mindful that labor markets remain tight, and our talent is important to our franchise. but you can see the movement we're making in our compensation year-to-date as a component of the overall efﬁciency ratio. and then on the non-compensation side, that remains very much a focus, and we will look to continue to make progress on non-comp with the goal of driving towards the efﬁciency target.",3,2022,0.9222551584243774,negative
1,0,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," so, thanks, glenn and i appreciate the question. obviously , an improved capital markets environment would certainly help in that direction. w e talk about our targets in a normalized environment. one thing i just want to make sure people are focused on is we have to do better in asset management. this certainly has been a part of our strategy over the last 3 years is to reduce our balance sheet and asset management. and we have made real progress on that over the last 3 years, but we still have a very signiﬁcant asset management balance sheet larger than we would like to have. w e reduced it by $9 billion this past year and we intend to move forward. but given the disruption in asset prices and the density of that balance sheet, it’ s not surprising when you have $32 billion of capital allocated to that segment. and if you look at the fourth quarter , the fourth quarter , it earned zero, even with some businesses in there that are highly proﬁtable, i don’t think that’ s normal. i don’t think our expectation is that continues exactly the same way . and so i think a combination of some normalization in capital markets activities and a more balanced environment with respect to the asset management balance sheet certainly would have a big impact. i’d highlight last year , we way outperformed the peer average roe by about 900 basis points because of kind of the massive outperformance of that balance sheet, given all the stimulus and a bunch of that reversed, and we’re just more sensitive to that.",4,2022,0.7387984395027161,negative
0,5,Brennan Hawken,Analyst,UBS,question," good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i just wanted to follow-up on some of those questions for mike. and just really be honest kind of surprised to not hear that there were restructuring and severance charges in the fourth quarter , just given how elevated the expenses were. so i guess, can you provide a little bit of color on the inﬂexibility , revenues down 20% for the full year . and i understand that, of course, markets are competitive, but the positioning of comp in 2021 was – it was a remarkable year . some of it even identiﬁed or segregated as special and therefore, shouldn’t be expected to repeat. so the – was the discipline fully there? are you doing enough on comp? you have reiterated the focus on efﬁciency , but the results here in – i get it, nobody is buying goldman today for 2022 results, but still the results seem to set up sort of a challenging entry point for the beginning of the year .",4,2022,0.8907149434089661,negative
1,5,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," so brennan, a couple of questions. as for the reasons to take severance expense in 2023, that’ s the accounting rules with respect to timing of our communication to those employees. so that’ s what explains the time frame in which the expenses going to be booked. as it relates to compensation expense, variable expense ﬂexibility in the fourth quarter , i guess i would point out a couple of things. one, the overall comp and beneﬁt expense were down 15%. w e had grown headcount by 10% additionally . and when you – that’ s over $2.5 billion of less compensation and beneﬁt expense, so it’ s a meaningful number . and if you look at the components of our employee base, we have a very large number of people that earn relatively less money are impacted by inﬂation and are really important to the overall operation and delivery of our ﬁrm on behalf of our clients. and we have relatively fewer employees that are higher earning employees face clients and generate revenue, and we were able to reduce the compensation substantially there in line with the performance. but ultimately , it’s a balance. and we have excellent people. w e depend on them to deliver for clients. the market for talent remains really robust, and we had to strike the right balance between taking down that variable expense in respect of our performance while maintaining the franchise to make sure that we’re in the position that we can deliver for clients and shareholders in 2023 and beyond. certainly , we can have brighter opportunity sets on the forward and we want to make sure that we are positioned to capture that.",4,2022,0.855790913105011,negative
4,6,Devin Ryan,Analyst,Citizens JMP,question," okay . great. thanks. a follow-up here just on the market’ s ﬁnancing opportunity . so, that’s already obviously been a nice part of the story for goldman. what do you need to do to grow ﬁnancing further? is it just a lot of the same kind of blocking and tackling, or are there speciﬁc things you could point to that could drive kind of another step function there? and then just kind of more near-term, you talked about prime brokerage balances being down and declining through the quarter . has that changed at all just to start this year with risk appetite to maybe a bit better today than through most of the fourth quarter?",4,2022,0.8080437183380127,negative
1,10,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. sure. i think that – i think one of the things we are dealing with and it’ s over- ampliﬁed in our very capital market-centric business is that 2021 was not normal. the second half of 2020 and 2021 were not normal. they were way inﬂated by the massive ﬁscal stimulus that created kind of, i would call, on the spectrum of activity , excess activity , pulled a lot of activity forward. and then because of market disruption, we have tightened monetary conditions meaningfully in 2022. it’ s the ﬁrst year in over 50 years that both ﬁxed income and equity markets were down. w e had the s&p  down 20%, the nasdaq down 30%. you had a real change in asset values across the spectrum. and when that happens, it takes a period of time for people to adjust. my historical experience would be that period of time is kind of four quarters to six quarters. and so if you think about it, if somebody had a stock that was trading at $100 and the stock goes down by 30%, certainly , for the next couple of quarters, they are still thinking about $100. but if it’ s at $70 for four quarters or ﬁve quarters, six quarters, then it’ s $70. and suddenly , when you look ahead and you think about either an m&a  transaction or ﬁnancing, you have more realism about the reset of values. so, i think we are well into that journey of a reset and expectations. i think it might have another quarter or two quarters to further reset, but i think we are starting to see some additional improvements, people point to the investment-grade debt market. that would obviously be where it would come ﬁrst. but my expectations would be in the back half of ‘23 meaningfully better . and also, it’ s interesting, and i will be heading to dallas tonight with others, but i was watching some of the commentary , the macro commentary . people are softening their view of 2023. and i would say it’ s getting a little bit more dovish, a little bit more of a softer landing than kind of where people were a quarter or two quarters ago. and that too, will af fect capital markets opportunity because it’ s really tied to conﬁdence. so, i think we are going through that. i don’t think anything has fundamentally changed. i think these capital markets businesses are still very big businesses. but you shouldn’t look at 2022 as normal, just as you shouldn’t look at 2021 is normal. they normalized somewhere in the middle.",4,2022,0.6434214115142822,negative
3,10,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so, as it relates to slowing growth, we actually did slow origination activity over the course of the fourth quarter . over the course of the year , we have implemented a number of changes to our credit underwriting, tightening some of those provisions. and so we actually did see a slowing of new originations. that being said, the vast majority of the provision build was attributable to the existing balances as opposed to the new originations. so, that’ s also something that we are going to watch very carefully as things develop. you notice our overall coverage ratio increasing. that’ s a function of what we have observed in our portfolio, but as well as our macroeconomic outlook. and so we have made some adjustments, which reﬂect our best estimates for performance in the economy going forward.",4,2022,0.5823367834091187,negative
1,1,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. so i appreciate the question. i mean, it's been interesting -- this morning just watching what i'd highlight is, i think we had a very solid quarter in ficc. w e had nearly a $4 billion quarter . and just to put that in perspective, i think that's a top- decile quarter for that. i think we've had -- i think it was the eighth best quarter on record. i think we've got 96 quarters. so it was a solid performance and just the headline number of $4 billion, the way we look at it, that's a very solid ficc quarter . it was certainly a quarter there was volatility in client activity throughout the quarter , and i think we were well positioned to serve our clients and served our clients well. now, some of the noise that i see just from the early morning release, our ficc business was down versus the ﬁrst quarter of last year by 17%, but in the ﬁrst quarter of last year , we had signiﬁcant outperformance. if i remember correctly , our ficc revenues in the ﬁrst quarter of last year were up year-over-year 21% when the competitor average was kind of ﬂat or down. and you can go look at that from a base perspective. w e had much more signiﬁcant outperformance in the ﬁrst quarter of 2022 because of our commodities business and the breadth of our commodities business. so if you remember back in the ﬁrst quarter of 2022, the war with ukraine started, there was more volatility in commodities and clients were very active in commodities. and so it was an outsized quarter in commodities in the ﬁrst quarter of 2022. but overall, i think ficc performance in the quarter was strong. w e were there to serve our clients. and by any standards, it was a good quarter . i think given the environment that we're operating in, i would expect activity to continue to be active with our clients. it's certainly an uncertain period of time and there's a lot of movement and positioning, and so we're ﬁnding our clients active at the moment.",1,2023,0.64177405834198,negative
1,5,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," so we sold about $1 billion of the marcus loans and the balance has been moved to held-for-sale, and so we'll be looking at moving down that position over time.",1,2023,0.6856217384338379,negative
1,10,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. i think there have been some greenshoots. there were certainly some greenshoots in february . levels are still muted. there are obviously a number of things out there that we'd like to get done, and we're seeing some indication of some signiﬁcant transactions starting to prepare to get -- to move forward, given markets seem to have settled down a little bit. but i still think we're below trend level. as i said earlier in the conversation, history tells you that there is plenty of capital raising that needs to get done. generally speaking, people have to use the capital markets to execute on their strategies. but when you have these slowdowns or these windows close, they typically -- you get that rebalanced after four to six quarters. we're kind of ﬁve quarters in. and so my expectation or hope is we won't see improvements from what have been very muted levels, but at this point, we had a very volatile march, and i'd say things are still slow , but we are starting to see some more greenshoots again. and we'll just have to watch and see how things unfold in the quarter and into the back half of the year .",1,2023,0.6466954946517944,negative
2,1,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," i mean just to add for you. so end of the second quarter , we ended -- headcount was 44,600 it’ s down about 2% on the quarter , about 8% year-to-date. i think the more comparable metric is probably the year-over-year metric of down 5% because we'll have new joiners in the third quarter . but as david said, we're happy about taking the action early in the year , positioning the ﬁrm appropriately and also pleased that we’ve been able to reach towards our target of $600 million in run rate payroll efﬁciencies.",2,2023,0.945608913898468,negative
0,8,Matt O’Connor,Analyst,Deutsche Bank,question," so the scb obviously came down very nicely this year and has been trending down for a couple of years now . we are getting some questions on how some of the consumer loan portfolios have impacted that. and speciﬁcally with the sale of the marcus loans and potentially sale of greensky loans and again, according to the media, potentially exit the credit card. i guess the question is, do those loans actually help bring down the scb? or what are the puts and takes there as you think about the impact of those loan portfolios in aggregate on the annual f aca.",2,2023,0.8656102418899536,negative
3,9,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. one other thing, gerard, i'd just add, if you go back, it's an interesting thing to do. if you go back and you look at investment banking revenues from people who report them, over the last 20-plus years, go back to 2000 and look at investment banking revenues. there's a change in the environment and investment banking revenues have dropped meaningfully because of that. you can go back and you can see that at other times over the last 20 to 25 years. you can see that from 2001 to 2002. you can see that from 2007 to 2008. you can see that in 2010 to 201 1. and obviously , you're seeing it from 2021 to 2022 and '23. what's interesting is to go look at what happens when you come out of the cycle and kind of look at the growth in the upshot because market cap grows, there's growth in the economy , etcetera, i don't think it's going to be dif ferent this time. i think this is a cycle. w e haven't seen a cycle in a while. and the other side of the cycle will continue to look attractive the services of advising the need for mergers and consolidation, even though there can be headwinds and friction, the need for capital markets activity , ipos, equity ﬁnancing, destiny , that's a fundamental part of our economy . it's not going away . it's been depressed for the last 4 to 6 quarters.",2,2023,0.7814465165138245,negative
1,10,Carey Halio,HIR,Goldman Sachs,answer," but you'll also notice that we reduced our coverage ratio this quarter as well. and that's because the performance of the activities is actually coming in better than we had originally expected. w e had put together provisions on a conservative basis. and now as we have more and more data coming through, we actually are comfortable in removing some of that conservatism and bringing down the coverage ratio. so i'd say trending as expected with overall better data coming through than originally anticipated.",2,2023,0.7901636362075806,negative
3,0,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. glenn, as i listened to you play it back, what i'd say , us economy has been more resilient. the ﬁscal stimulus has helped mute the material tightening of monetary conditions that's occurred. i'm still of the belief that there's been a lag with this tightening and across a broad swath of the economy , we will see more sluggishness. now that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be a recession, and certainly , there's a good debate on where this all lands. but we, again, in the past quarter materially tightened economic conditions. and i just think there's a lag in most sectors of the economy , not all, but most sectors of the economy . and i do think over the next two to four quarters, the impact of that tightening will be more evident and will create slowdowns in some areas. i am hearing as i interact with ceos, particularly around consumer businesses, some softness, particularly in the last eight weeks in certain consumer behaviors. i don't want to over-amplify that because i think the economy and the consumer has been more resilient. but i think that gear from watching closely .",3,2023,0.6179898381233215,negative
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America,question," good morning. i guess maybe just one ﬁrst follow-up, denis. i just want to make sure i heard you correct. did you say you marked your cre exposure by 50% in cre ofﬁce? and on that, just give us a sense of visibility even beyond ofﬁce cre. clearly , it's a very manageable issue for you, but it remains sort of a source of nuisance and earnings noise. how much more do we have to go before this is kind of pinned down?",3,2023,0.6114552021026611,negative
1,1,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so, yes, to clarify , for our cre and cie exposure in the ofﬁce space, we've either marked or impaired that down by about approximately 50% this year . so that's -- i think that's quite signiﬁcant. w e started the year with about $15 billion of cre alternative investments. that's been reduced now by about $5 billion. 3/4 of that was either through paydowns or dispositions, the balance through marks and impairments. so we're making very , very signiﬁcant progress against those exposures. if you were to look at the same set of exposures in non-ofﬁce, the adjustment there through marks, our impairment is about 15% year-to-date. so we feel we've reduced a lot of notional appropriately reﬂected the valuations in those positions. but as indicated by our targets, we intend to continue to move down those exposures.",3,2023,0.5953677892684937,negative
4,2,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. what i'd add is we obviously remain very focused on the overall credit quality of the portfolio. a couple of things to bear in mind. in consumer , the net charge-of f ratio for the quarter was 5.1%, down from 5.8% last quarter and the total dollar amount of charge-of fs down as well. you'll also see that our coverage ratio now stands at 13.3%, which we think is an appropriate level, given our expectations for the portfolio. that adjustment is basically a function of greensky being removed from that ratio. and so now that applies to the cards portfolio, but we feel good about where that stands right now . on the overall performance of credit on the forward, we'll continue to be focused. w e made a number of adjustments to our credit underwriting box, and we'll continue to monitor that as we move through the economic environment.",3,2023,0.9274399280548096,negative
0,8,Daniel Fannon,Analyst,Jeffries,question," thanks. good morning. i had a question on platform solutions. so for the quarter , if we exclude the write-down, is this a reasonable run rate for expenses? and as you think about achieving your target of proﬁtability in this business, is this going to come more from the expense side or revenue growth? and if you could also just give an outlook for transaction banking, just given revenues are down both sequentially and year-over-year .",3,2023,0.7225466966629028,negative
1,8,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thank you for the question. i don't think it's the right run rate. i think there's a combination of things that we expect over the next 12 months in terms of growth in revenue, composition of the clients as well as ongoing efﬁciency with respect to expenses. so i think we should be outperforming any type of run rate analysis. i think on transaction banking, we've tried to explain the strategic focus for us for that business, which is to grow a higher-quality client business over the long term. w e had grown quickly . we're now focused on growing with high-quality clients, high- quality deposits. as you note, the revenues and the deposit balances were down slightly sequentially , i think, reasonably in line with the industry , given some migration to other higher-yielding opportunity sets. but we did grow our client count. w e remain committed to the business and we think that it works very well with our overall investment banking franchise and footprint, and we think it could be a good value unlock over the longer term for goldman sachs.",3,2023,0.5491792559623718,negative
3,9,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC,question," okay , very helpful. and then as a follow-up, it's not a big line item obviously for you folks. but can you share with us some of the color in the transaction banking area? that was obviously a new business line that you guys created. just how is it going? i saw the revenues were down slightly , i think, sequentially . but what's going on in that line of business? and again, granted it's not a major line of business for you folks at this time.",3,2023,0.9132696390151978,negative
4,9,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. no. thanks, gerard. our transaction banking activity remains a strategic focus. the revenues and the deposit balances are down slightly on a quarter-over- quarter basis. those things are linked. w e have grown our client count, and we remain committed to making the investments to grow high-quality balances and clients in that business over the medium to long term. no change in strategy .",3,2023,0.9041443467140198,negative
2,10,Saul Martinez,Analyst,HSBC,question," okay , that's helpful. and just maybe a quick follow-up there. i think you mentioned that ncos, net charge-of fs, were down this quarter . is that -- and you do have a 13.3 reserve coverage. it does seem like your maybe closer to a scenario where provisioning to come down quite a bit, especially under cecl. but just maybe just give us a sense of how you're feeling about the credit outlook. and is my assessment right that your reserving could -- especially if you slow down, it could come down pretty materially over the next year to two years?",3,2023,0.9362313151359558,negative
3,10,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," so you have a couple of facts that are right. w e did have a charge-of f ratio that was down sequentially quarter-over-quarter from 5.8 to 5.1 and lower charge-of fs. w e are not necessarily predicting that's the ongoing path for credit in the consumer portfolio. it's something we're still mindful of, given the environment, given the vintages in which we've originated those exposures. w e do feel that the coverage ratio at 13.3 is appropriate, and we obviously set that based on our expected life of loan losses. so as we move forward, our expectation is we'll continue to see elevated charge-of fs. and as you look at our reporting on that with greensky pulled out of the consumer line, you'll have a more pure look at the cards platform, and we do expect that will show elevated charge-of fs.",3,2023,0.6670251488685608,negative
0,11,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo,question," hi. just a clariﬁcation on my prior question. so if i have this right, you reduced your pe investments by $3 billion quarter-over-quarter , and that allowed a $2.5 billion reduction in capital allocated to the asset management and w ealth segment. i mean, is that completely correlated. so if you get rid of the $21 billion of remaining principal investments, would that free up, say , $16 billion? is that ballpark right?",3,2023,0.5152319073677063,negative
2,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America,question," i just wanted to spend some time on the ficc business. so if i'm looking at the right numbers, it feels like ficc revenues are now back to pre-covid levels if you go back to 1q of '19. maybe if you can unpack it, just looking at slide 13, seemed like most products were quite weak. give us some perspective around does both -- the intermediation piece of ficc, does that feel like we are close to trough, and unlike seasonality , we should see some improvement in ficc from here, if you can just provide some perspective there.",4,2023,0.6001150012016296,negative
0,0,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore,question," hi. thanks very much. it's a tough one because you are deﬁnitely executing on a lot of the objectives you laid out. and of course, the sustainability of banking is what it is. i noticed your lower pipeline. but the real question i have is, the sustainability of the whole package, meaning, you just had really strong revenue across the board on everything. comp was up with that normally , but non-comp is down, the provision is down and r wa didn't increase even though you were growing your ﬁnancing. so i'm giving you a softball here and just saying, what of that package can continue to stick?",1,2024,0.510114312171936,negative
3,0,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," good morning, glenn. it's dennis. as we've said over the last number of quarters, we've been very , very focused on non-comp and containing the growth of non-comp. there clearly are inﬂationary pressures that impact a number of items in our non- comp expense. the sharp decrease sequentially we're pleased with, as well as the year-over-year decrease, but there were a number of items over the course of last year that we didn't necessarily expect to repeat. and so it's good to get on to a more normalized operating trajectory with respect to our non-comp expense base, but it's something we're going to remain very , very focused on managing in a disciplined fashion. but i think this quarter is a much more normal quarter than some of the preceding quarters.",1,2024,0.49412423372268677,negative
5,4,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," look, as a general matter , what i'd say , mike, as a general matter , we're supporters of stress testing. w e believe it's an important component of the fed's mandate to really ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system. however , we've maintained for some time that there are elements of this process that may be distracting from these goals of safety and soundness. the stress test process, as you just highlighted, is opaque. it lacks transparency . it contributes to excess volatility and the stress capital buf fer requirements, which obviously makes prudent capital management difﬁcult for us and all of our peers. w e don't believe that the results reﬂect the signiﬁcant changes we've made in our business. they're not in line with our own calculations, despite the fact that the scenarios are consistent year- over-year . now, despite all that, you know , we've got the capital ﬂexibility to serve our clients. we'll continue to work with that capital ﬂexibility and we'll also continue to engage around this process to ensure that over time we can drive the level of capital that we have to hold in our business mix down. but obviously we have more work to do given this result.",2,2024,0.48094743490219116,negative
0,5,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research,question," hi, good morning. so i wanted to start of f with a question. just want to start with a question on the consumer platform fees. they were down only modestly despite the absence of the green sky contribution. just wanted to better understand what drove the resiliency in consumer revenues, whether the quarterly run rate of $600 million is a reasonable jumping of f point as we look at the next quarter?",2,2024,0.7531920075416565,negative
1,5,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," so, steve, thank you for the question. i mean on a sequential basis, they're down, but that's because we have the absence of the green sky contribution. there actually is growth across the card portfolio. i think you've seen that the level of growth has slowed as we have sort of implemented several rounds of underwriting adjustments to the card originations and so our expectation is that on the forward you know the period-over-period growth should be more muted.",2,2024,0.8405488729476929,negative
1,7,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thank you. obviously , an ongoing commitment of ours to move down those on balance sheet exposures, also part of the equity and capital story and returns in the segment at $2.2 billion for the quarter , that was a decent reduction. w e obviously have a target out there to sell down the vast majority of that balance, which is now at $12.6 billion by the end of next year . but our expectation is that we will continue to chip away at it across both the third and the fourth quarter of this year and then on into 2025. there's really no change on our commitment to sell down the vast majority of that by the end of next year .",2,2024,0.41661596298217773,negative
0,7,Devin Ryan,Analyst,Citizens JMP,question," question on just the alternative asset management fundraising. and looking at the fee rates. so, the largest at bucket corporate equity is seeing a declining fee rate since the end of 2022. i know there were some legacy funds in there that are sensing, but it would just be great to get an update on the outlook for the fee rates, just given all that fundraising that you've done in alts in recent years. and just when we should think about the inﬂection occurring as recently raised aum moves into fee earnings? and then we should think about kind of the right steady state because it would seem like out there.",3,2024,0.7525175213813782,negative
1,0,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," good morning, glenn. it's denis. i'll take that. i think when you think about the components of our overall ﬁnancing, the reality is we continue to see signiﬁcant demand across the client base for both our ficc and equity ﬁnancing. i think what you're referencing given change in asset prices and market activity , we did have a level of record average prime balances over the course of the ﬁrst quarter , but it's reasonable to expect that some of those balances come down as asset prices reset and then you'll continue to support clients with their ﬁnancing needs, but perhaps of f of a lower base given the adjustment in market prices.",1,2025,0.6748204231262207,negative
1,1,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," yeah. i'm going to start, and denis can jump in. but i'd say a couple of things. first of all, obviously , no one can argue that april 2nd, a handful of things happened that shifted perspectives. but i would say there were things going on before april 2nd that we're shifting perspectives that also led to more activity . so there's no question, and we've talked about this publicly a bunch that we started to see growth showing and slowing in late january and early february . we obviously saw signiﬁcant moves in equity markets as people positioned for a dif ferent kind of trade policies during march, and we saw signiﬁcant moves in the march period, which actually led to higher activity for us in a variety of ways. w e're early in the quarter , and so far the business is performing very well and clients are very active. and so, i know there is a higher level of uncertainty , but at the same point, clients are active, people are shifting positions, and we still see signiﬁcant activity levels. i mean, denis, do you want to add to that at all?",1,2025,0.40147578716278076,negative
4,3,Betsy Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley,question," okay . thanks so much. denis, one for you on v ar, value-at-risk. this quarter was down broadly throughout the dif ferent categories q-on-q, which i thought was interesting given the heightened volatility that we had across a variety of dif ferent markets. can you remind us how volatility impacts v ar and how we should be thinking about v ar efﬁciency , which clearly went up dramatically , and just wanted to understand how to think about that on a go-forward basis? thanks.",1,2025,0.7232248187065125,negative
0,7,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," look, i appreciate the question and the observation. w e're proud of how we've managed all of those metrics while delivering the type of performance and market shares that we have. i think the way i would phrase it is, we are accustomed to operating our ﬁnancial resources in a very nimble fashion, given where we sit. and i think our team collectively performed really well with what we refer to as keen eyes on risk management. w e also have a keen eye on ﬁnancial resource deployment. and so it is, as you see, it's a strong on a ﬁnancial resource adjusted basis. matt o’connor okay . and then separately , within the historical principal investment book, you had about a $600 million drop in a somewhat tough quarter . what's your thought process on the pace from here? and just remind us of that target, i think it was by the end of next year , you're targeting around $2 billion. just wondering if that's right and still stands? thank you.",1,2025,0.4837215542793274,negative
0,11,Saul Martinez,Analyst,HSBC,question," hi, good morning. thank you for taking my question. i hate to beat a dead horse here on capital, but i did want to follow up on betsy and matt's questions, and what they mean for r wa progression? r wa is up slightly this quarter . your peers had much bigger increases. markets r wa is down, v ar is down. if i look at r wa density on a standardized basis, it came down quite a bit. it's at its lowest level i think that i can see in recent history . so just is there anything unusual in terms of r wa progression or v ars or exposures? and how do we just rethink about r wa density and r wa progression from here because obviously it does matter in terms of forecasting cet1 ratios and the level of excess capital over time?",1,2025,0.8181731104850769,negative
