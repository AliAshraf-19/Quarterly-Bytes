1,1,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," i will start, christian. i don’t know if denis will add anything to it. i think our tone is cautious, because the environment is uncertain. the environment is very uncertain. we don’t have a crystal ball to tell you exactly how monetary policy will navigate the inﬂationary environment that exists, but there is no question that economic conditions are tightening to try to control inﬂation. and as economic conditions tighten, it will have a bigger impact on corporate conﬁdence and also consumer activity in the economy . i think it’ s hard to gauge exactly how that will play out. and so i think it’ s prudent for us to be cautious. now that said, i think one of the things you saw this quarter is we have a much broader , much more diverse, much more global, much more resilient business than we might have had 5, 7, 10 years ago, and we beneﬁted from that in the context of the quarter . so we feel good about our ability to operate. i would say that, at the moment, while there is a lot of uncertainty , clients are still relatively active. denis was just talking about m&a  activity , and our clients are active. capital markets activity is obviously down. this is not an environment where everyone is looking to shed all risk, but it’ s certainly an environment where people are more cautious about risk. so we continue to monitor it, but i think it’ s prudent and appropriate for us to be cautious. and if you go back and listen to some of the words, we said we’re evaluating things with respect to resources. w e’re being ﬂexible and being prepared to be nimble in case the environment gets worse. by the way , we don’t know that the environment is going to get worse. the environment might get better , too. so i just think it’ s a time where prudence and caution makes a lot of sense. now with respect to our targets, i want to be clear , we set medium-term targets for 2024, and we still plan on meeting those targets. and we don’t see anything in this environment that will prevent us from meeting those targets. i’m not going to speculate on a quarter-by-quarter basis as to what the trajectory looks along the way . but i would say in what’ s been certainly a very difﬁcult ﬁrst half of the year , if you think about the headwinds we’ve faced in both public equity markets because of the war in ukraine and the unwind of the business in russia, etcetera, i think there have been some exogenous events in this ﬁrst half of the year that certainly created bigger headwinds than we might see in other times going forward. so we remain comfortable and committed to our targets, and we will continue to move forward expeditiously to meet them.",2,2022,0.5338481664657593,Negative
3,4,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," well, i guess i’d say a couple of things. w e always – i think we’re very nimble allocators of resources, ﬁnancial resources, human resources. w e try to have a very , very ﬂexible, nimble approach. and so of course, we’ve expressed earlier in the call, we think this is an uncertain environment, and we’re going to be cautious. of course, we will have plans in hand to the degree the environment gets worse. with respect to capital markets activity , i think i told you at the beginning of the year in our january call on january 15 that i did not expect us to see the level of capital markets activity we saw in 2021 anytime soon. and i wouldn’t call that as normal. so when you talk about capital markets activity going back to what we saw in the past couple of years. i, don’t think we’re going back to that anytime soon. but i do think if you look at capital markets activity kind of average levels over the last 7 years, take a period 5 years, 7 years, and look at average levels, i’d be very surprised if we don’t get back to some average level of capital markets activity sometime over the course of the next few quarters. and history would just tell you that, that doesn’t mean that it might not take a little bit longer this time if things get increasingly uncertain. but generally speaking, one of the things that af fects capital markets activity is people have to reset their mind around valuation. they have to reset their mind around capital costs. and that happens relatively quickly because people have plans. they have commitments. they have to invest. and as soon as they get their minds around that, they adjust, which takes a few quarters, they get back into the market that’ s available to them. and so i’d be very surprised if we don’t see, as we head into 2023, some sort of a normalization of capital markets activity . now we might not because the world could get worse, and it could stay more difﬁcult longer . but it’ s not baked in the cake, in my opinion, that we’re headed to a super negative environment, but it is uncertain. it is a little bumpy , and so we’re going to proceed cautiously .",2,2022,0.542778491973877,Negative
2,5,Brennan Hawken,Analyst,UBS,question," okay , great. thanks for that color , denis. appreciate it. and for the second question, i am curious, we have seen – you talked a lot about m&a  and how , obviously , your investment bank franchise is holding up really well. but just sort of a question around the environment and we have seen riskier debt issuance slow a lot year-to-date and started to hear chatter that availability has actually continued to become challenging. so, curious whether or not that’ s also what you are seeing and whether or not there is any concern that, that availability , lesser availability might become a challenge and lead to some pockets of stress for some of the more levered borrowers?",2,2022,0.9576162099838257,Negative
3,10,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC,question," very good. and just as a follow-up, maybe you guys can give us a little deeper color into the ecm business. obviously , according to the dealogic numbers, the ﬁrst six months of this year , we all know were very weak and market conditions, we recognize as being the driver . but david, you alluded to maybe the price expectations are coming down. w as it primarily just the volatility that pushed everybody to the sideline? w as it lower valuations that pushed them there? what did you guys see as the biggest drivers for these really weak numbers for the industry , not just for you folks?",2,2022,0.9989199638366699,Negative
0,7,Devin Ryan,Analyst,Citizens JMP,question," i want to ask a question just on investment banking. m&a  ﬁnancing markets have obviously become a little more complicated recently and seen some negative marks on recent deals. i'm just curious whether you feel like some of that friction is just transitory or whether ﬁnancing markets are really starting to maybe become more concerning and crack a bit. and then kind of interrelated, just how much that's weighing on your outlook for m&a  advisory business? and where it sounds like backlogs are still solid, but you need functioning ﬁnancing as well.",3,2022,0.6485368013381958,Negative
3,10,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," i don't think it's simple for sure, gerard. i think it's still pretty uncertain. i do think we have to get to a point where we better understand the trajectory of inﬂation and, therefore, understand the trajectory of economic growth going forward. the fed is executing and has sent some very , very clear goals as to where they're going to the tightening cycle in the near term, but i think there's uncertainty whether or not that will get inﬂation to a place where the policy will shift going forward. and so i think we're in an uncertain period. i think that this warrants, and we're operating the ﬁrm this way with a sense of caution as we look forward. but we'll have to watch closely . but i don't have a clear answer for you as to whether or not -- if we get to the fed's current trajectory , we'll be in a place where economic growth prospects will improve as we look ahead from 2023 into 2024. i think that's still relatively uncertain.",3,2022,0.9771671891212463,Negative
6,4,Mike Mayo,Analyst,Wells Fargo,question," yes, the follow-up is more speciﬁc. i mean, look, you said it’ s a disappointing quarter . your returns are well below where you want them to be, and variable revenues and variable costs, not so much your efﬁciency ratios go the other direction. so i mean, i think investors would appreciate some detail on some of the beneﬁts of what you might get on the expense side, okay , you’re scaling back consumer as i asked you last quarter , you said you were losing money so maybe you lose less money . the headcount reduction should allow you to save money . so can you ballpark the beneﬁts to expenses from the moves in consumer and the headcount reductions? and along those lines now that you’ve moved capital well above the regulatory and your own ﬁrm’ s target buyback so cost and buyback kind of what to think about for 2023?",4,2022,0.9962339997291565,Negative
0,5,Brennan Hawken,Analyst,UBS,question," good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i just wanted to follow-up on some of those questions for mike. and just really be honest kind of surprised to not hear that there were restructuring and severance charges in the fourth quarter , just given how elevated the expenses were. so i guess, can you provide a little bit of color on the inﬂexibility , revenues down 20% for the full year . and i understand that, of course, markets are competitive, but the positioning of comp in 2021 was – it was a remarkable year . some of it even identiﬁed or segregated as special and therefore, shouldn’t be expected to repeat. so the – was the discipline fully there? are you doing enough on comp? you have reiterated the focus on efﬁciency , but the results here in – i get it, nobody is buying goldman today for 2022 results, but still the results seem to set up sort of a challenging entry point for the beginning of the year .",4,2022,0.9242745637893677,Negative
2,9,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC,question," very good. and then as a follow-up on the shift in strategy in the consumer business, you have been very clear , obviously , on how you are positioning this going forward. i may have missed this, so i apologize. but what went wrong? when you go back to when you guys started to move into these businesses 3 years ago or so, i know marcus deposits has been around longer than that. but when you look back on what you were hoping to do and how it turned out, what went wrong?",4,2022,0.6359280943870544,Negative
3,10,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so, as it relates to slowing growth, we actually did slow origination activity over the course of the fourth quarter . over the course of the year , we have implemented a number of changes to our credit underwriting, tightening some of those provisions. and so we actually did see a slowing of new originations. that being said, the vast majority of the provision build was attributable to the existing balances as opposed to the new originations. so, that’ s also something that we are going to watch very carefully as things develop. you notice our overall coverage ratio increasing. that’ s a function of what we have observed in our portfolio, but as well as our macroeconomic outlook. and so we have made some adjustments, which reﬂect our best estimates for performance in the economy going forward.",4,2022,0.9392927885055542,Negative
2,9,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC,question," david, in your comments about your principal investments, you mentioned obviously market conditions will impact how quickly you get to your targeted goal of $15 billion by the end of '24. in those market conditions, is it more the ipo and ecm markets that have a bigger headwind for you in this area? or is it just general market levels and the activity we're seeing?",1,2023,0.5432995557785034,Negative
1,10,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. i think there have been some greenshoots. there were certainly some greenshoots in february . levels are still muted. there are obviously a number of things out there that we'd like to get done, and we're seeing some indication of some signiﬁcant transactions starting to prepare to get -- to move forward, given markets seem to have settled down a little bit. but i still think we're below trend level. as i said earlier in the conversation, history tells you that there is plenty of capital raising that needs to get done. generally speaking, people have to use the capital markets to execute on their strategies. but when you have these slowdowns or these windows close, they typically -- you get that rebalanced after four to six quarters. we're kind of ﬁve quarters in. and so my expectation or hope is we won't see improvements from what have been very muted levels, but at this point, we had a very volatile march, and i'd say things are still slow , but we are starting to see some more greenshoots again. and we'll just have to watch and see how things unfold in the quarter and into the back half of the year .",1,2023,0.7824559211730957,Negative
2,5,Brennan Hawken,Analyst,UBS,question," great, i appreciate it. and then for my second, you started the process of selling greensky . we saw the goodwill impairment. what's been the reception to that asset? and has that impacted your expectation for how quickly you could ﬁnalize that sale?",2,2023,0.933933436870575,Negative
0,8,Matt O’Connor,Analyst,Deutsche Bank,question," so the scb obviously came down very nicely this year and has been trending down for a couple of years now . we are getting some questions on how some of the consumer loan portfolios have impacted that. and speciﬁcally with the sale of the marcus loans and potentially sale of greensky loans and again, according to the media, potentially exit the credit card. i guess the question is, do those loans actually help bring down the scb? or what are the puts and takes there as you think about the impact of those loan portfolios in aggregate on the annual f aca.",2,2023,0.7931227087974548,Negative
3,9,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. one other thing, gerard, i'd just add, if you go back, it's an interesting thing to do. if you go back and you look at investment banking revenues from people who report them, over the last 20-plus years, go back to 2000 and look at investment banking revenues. there's a change in the environment and investment banking revenues have dropped meaningfully because of that. you can go back and you can see that at other times over the last 20 to 25 years. you can see that from 2001 to 2002. you can see that from 2007 to 2008. you can see that in 2010 to 201 1. and obviously , you're seeing it from 2021 to 2022 and '23. what's interesting is to go look at what happens when you come out of the cycle and kind of look at the growth in the upshot because market cap grows, there's growth in the economy , etcetera, i don't think it's going to be dif ferent this time. i think this is a cycle. w e haven't seen a cycle in a while. and the other side of the cycle will continue to look attractive the services of advising the need for mergers and consolidation, even though there can be headwinds and friction, the need for capital markets activity , ipos, equity ﬁnancing, destiny , that's a fundamental part of our economy . it's not going away . it's been depressed for the last 4 to 6 quarters.",2,2023,0.6037792563438416,Negative
0,0,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore,question," hi. thanks so much. i guess just big picture, if we add back all the signiﬁcant items in the quarter , we're obviously still well short of the mid-teens targets. i know this is super slow times, like decade lows in investment banking, and you're in the process of hopefully reducing a lot of on-balance sheet stuf f. so i wonder if you could help us bridge the gap from here to there because in the back of our mind, we also have the potentially up to 25% increase in the denominator . so i wonder if you could bridge the gap of like how much is -- comes, do you think, from improvement in capital markets activity? how much is yet to be freed up capital from the denominator? i know it's tough but i want to say high level [indiscernible] pieces and thanks.",3,2023,0.6377428770065308,Negative
3,0,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. glenn, as i listened to you play it back, what i'd say , us economy has been more resilient. the ﬁscal stimulus has helped mute the material tightening of monetary conditions that's occurred. i'm still of the belief that there's been a lag with this tightening and across a broad swath of the economy , we will see more sluggishness. now that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be a recession, and certainly , there's a good debate on where this all lands. but we, again, in the past quarter materially tightened economic conditions. and i just think there's a lag in most sectors of the economy , not all, but most sectors of the economy . and i do think over the next two to four quarters, the impact of that tightening will be more evident and will create slowdowns in some areas. i am hearing as i interact with ceos, particularly around consumer businesses, some softness, particularly in the last eight weeks in certain consumer behaviors. i don't want to over-amplify that because i think the economy and the consumer has been more resilient. but i think that gear from watching closely .",3,2023,0.9711758494377136,Negative
4,3,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research,question," that's great color . and just for my follow-up, a broader question on the sponsor outlook. alts fundraising, it's continued at a healthy clip, but pe is facing numerous headwinds, whether it's the lp  denominator ef fect, higher rates and just slower realization activity in general. i was hoping you could speak to the broader outlook for the sponsor business and the implications for both the sponsor booking activity as well as the alternative asset management business.",3,2023,0.9292673468589783,Negative
5,5,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. so i think denis highlighted this in the prepared remarks. w e've built a pretty big cushion and buf fer, given that we successfully reduced our scd based on actions we're taking. w e think that under the stress test, as we continue to reduce principal investments, we will have more beneﬁt to scd. now obviously , basel is out there and it's uncertain, so we're, at the moment, operating a little bit more conservatively around that, and we've highlighted that we probably will be a little bit more conservative on buybacks until we have more clarity . but we will continue to buy back stock. w e will continue to pay our dividend. and as we have clarity under this strategy , there should be meaningfully more capital release, which could ultimately beneﬁt to further buyback. but at the moment, we'd like -- we're going to be a little bit more cautious and have a little bit more clarity around the capital rules before we ﬂow ahead.",3,2023,0.9245359897613525,Negative
0,8,Daniel Fannon,Analyst,Jeffries,question," thanks. good morning. i had a question on platform solutions. so for the quarter , if we exclude the write-down, is this a reasonable run rate for expenses? and as you think about achieving your target of proﬁtability in this business, is this going to come more from the expense side or revenue growth? and if you could also just give an outlook for transaction banking, just given revenues are down both sequentially and year-over-year .",3,2023,0.8674030303955078,Negative
2,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America,question," i just wanted to spend some time on the ficc business. so if i'm looking at the right numbers, it feels like ficc revenues are now back to pre-covid levels if you go back to 1q of '19. maybe if you can unpack it, just looking at slide 13, seemed like most products were quite weak. give us some perspective around does both -- the intermediation piece of ficc, does that feel like we are close to trough, and unlike seasonality , we should see some improvement in ficc from here, if you can just provide some perspective there.",4,2023,0.9637446403503418,Negative
3,3,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," they absolutely do. i mean, when markets improve, they help the disposition. there's no question. i also -- when you look at the last two years, we've had real headwinds in terms of revenue against the balance sheet that we could have more of that, but on a much smaller balance sheet in 2024. with a better market, you actually might have some beneﬁt to revenue performance, but we're focused on reducing that broadly . you see you have more transparency now in the platforms as we continue to close on greensky , move gm to held for sale. and so you have more transparency on that. w e think the drag will be signiﬁcantly reduced in 2024. when we're comfortable providing more speciﬁc color on that, we will provide it.",4,2023,0.5177145004272461,Negative
6,8,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," well, it's scale. the americas is the biggest part of the activity level. and just given the resilience of the us economy , i think you've seen a material pick up there, proportionally that's broader than other places. but we are seeing more activity across europe, particularly strategic dialogue. i'd say , the one place where things are slower , obviously , is in asia with respect to china. and just given the nature of economic activity there, where things are positioned, that still seems slower , both on both the m&a  side and the capital market side. but those are comments that make it a high-level, gerard.",4,2023,0.7522264122962952,Negative
2,4,Brennan Hawken,Analyst,UBS,question," great. thanks. thanks for that color , david. i appreciate it. and then another question on alts. so, fundraising looks really good. i know there can be some noise in the revenue. so, just curious about the alts revenue down year-over-year and the aus only up sort of marginally sequentially . could you give some color around what was happening in those lines and maybe any potential noise?",1,2024,0.6693798899650574,Negative
0,9,Saul Martinez,Analyst,HSBC,question," hi. thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to ask about your ﬁnancing business in markets. and obviously , there's uncertainty about the basel end-game proposal. as you mentioned, the direction of travel seems to be for it to be materially lightened or even re-proposed. but one of the areas where it is very punitive versus other jurisdictions is in securities ﬁnancing, the risk weightings for unlisted entities. and if that part of the proposal isn't materially altered, it doesn't seem like it necessarily is a focus, does that impact your ability to grow your ﬁnancing revenues? is it a threat? is it not a big deal? can you of fset it through pricing, product design? just curious if you can provide a little color on that.",1,2024,0.6721660494804382,Negative
5,4,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," look, as a general matter , what i'd say , mike, as a general matter , we're supporters of stress testing. w e believe it's an important component of the fed's mandate to really ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system. however , we've maintained for some time that there are elements of this process that may be distracting from these goals of safety and soundness. the stress test process, as you just highlighted, is opaque. it lacks transparency . it contributes to excess volatility and the stress capital buf fer requirements, which obviously makes prudent capital management difﬁcult for us and all of our peers. w e don't believe that the results reﬂect the signiﬁcant changes we've made in our business. they're not in line with our own calculations, despite the fact that the scenarios are consistent year- over-year . now, despite all that, you know , we've got the capital ﬂexibility to serve our clients. we'll continue to work with that capital ﬂexibility and we'll also continue to engage around this process to ensure that over time we can drive the level of capital that we have to hold in our business mix down. but obviously we have more work to do given this result.",2,2024,0.9382886290550232,Negative
1,5,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," so, steve, thank you for the question. i mean on a sequential basis, they're down, but that's because we have the absence of the green sky contribution. there actually is growth across the card portfolio. i think you've seen that the level of growth has slowed as we have sort of implemented several rounds of underwriting adjustments to the card originations and so our expectation is that on the forward you know the period-over-period growth should be more muted.",2,2024,0.9986007809638977,Negative
2,0,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore,question," i appreciate that. this one will be a short follow-up. with hpi was weak, but that'll happen on any given quarter . i think if you look over a long period of time, you've earned good returns on your historical principal investments. but as that book shrinks the 10.9 that's left, the 4 billion attributed to it, if i take a, should i -- is it okay to take a historical roe-ish on that capital to think about the lower revenue corresponding to the lower book going forward on hpi?",3,2024,0.7867083549499512,Negative
0,2,Christian Bolu,Analyst,Autonomous Research,question," can you hear me? i just have a question on the trading business and the competitive landscape. how are you thinking about the -- maybe the broader competitive landscape with the -- with other banks? your market share seemed to peak in 2022. it's been a bit choppy since then as a market share. just curious, are you seeing signs of competitors coming back, increasing competition from anywhere. i'm just curious on your thoughts there.",3,2024,0.782660722732544,Negative
0,6,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research,question," i wanted to spend some time just looking at or unpacking some of the self-help levers, recognizing that the business is still burdened by capital consumption from some of the noncore assets, whether it's in consumer or equity investments. denis, i believe in your prepared remarks, you alluded to an 80 bp drag on roe from consumer . and i was hoping you could maybe provide a more holistic picture, just frame the drag on returns from various noncore activities today . and are there any remaining self-help levers that could bolster returns which may still be on the come?",3,2024,0.7270560264587402,Negative
2,2,Betsy Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley,question," hi. i did just want to follow up on one thing here regarding the point you were making on platform solutions. it's a drag right now , 75 bps to 100 bps on roe, but '25 and '26, that will improve. so could you just step us through -- i mean, we know what your plans are for platform solutions. but i'm wondering what's happening in '25 and '26 that will drive the reduction of the drag in this year and next, if you could speak through that.",4,2024,0.585633397102356,Negative
1,0,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," good morning, glenn. it's denis. i'll take that. i think when you think about the components of our overall ﬁnancing, the reality is we continue to see signiﬁcant demand across the client base for both our ficc and equity ﬁnancing. i think what you're referencing given change in asset prices and market activity , we did have a level of record average prime balances over the course of the ﬁrst quarter , but it's reasonable to expect that some of those balances come down as asset prices reset and then you'll continue to support clients with their ﬁnancing needs, but perhaps of f of a lower base given the adjustment in market prices.",1,2025,0.9732251167297363,Negative
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America,question," hey, good morning. i wanted to follow up on glenn's question. i guess, denis, i think the view is the world in-markets changed a little bit come april 2nd, and the risk from an investor standpoint is activity fallen of f the clif f. it's negative for ﬁnancing. it could be negative for trading. so i'm not sure if you have data in terms of the 10 days for april. and if you can give us -- if you can contextualize just how negative the last 10 days have been following a very strong 1q and how we should think about just where clients are as we go back to debating good volatility versus bad volatility?",1,2025,0.9422439932823181,Negative
5,3,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thanks, betsy . good question. so obviously , there's multiple components to var across the various asset classes and then a diversiﬁcation ef fect as well. over the course of the ﬁrst quarter for our average daily v ar, we had reduced exposures offset by elevated levels of volatility . so you obviously have both factors across asset classes that factor into the calculation. but to your question, obviously increased or persistent levels of volatility could have upward pressure on a v ar measure.",1,2025,0.5394721627235413,Negative
0,5,Steven Chubak,Analyst,Wolfe Research,question," hi, good morning, david. thanks for taking my questions. i had a two-parter on alternatives, david. i was hoping you could speak to bigger picture, just the outlook for sponsor activity across the complex, given some of the headwinds to realization activity as well as the heightened macro uncertainty you cited. and then just drilling down to the third-party alts disclosure, what contributed to that fee rate contraction on the credit side, just given the step down was meaningful? and i know that's a high priority growth area for you and the management team.",1,2025,0.6364207863807678,Negative
4,5,David Solomon,CEO,Goldman Sachs,answer," yeah. so i mean there are a couple of things, steven, that i'd say , ﬁrst of all, this is a little bit counterintuitive. but when the landscape changes, companies have to rethink their strategic positioning. and interestingly , when you look at dialogues, dialogues are increasing. now obviously , increased dialogues take a while to turn into deals and play through. but denis was quite clear we had a notable increase in our backlog. our backlog is up a lot during the quarter . obviously , revenues lag the period of deal announcements. so the backlog and the deal announcements are reﬂective of the second half of last year , the early part of this year . in a period of uncertainty , things will slow down. but again, it's a big complex world. there's a lot of change going on. dialogues are up. i do think for a period of time, there'll be some uncertainty around how certain things that were close proceed forward. but i would expect a signiﬁcant amount of m&a  activity through the rest of the year . but obviously , if the landscape got more constrained, there's a risk of it slowing. but we're continuing to be out with clients doing the things that we do. and i don't see anything at the moment that leads me to believe that it's a fundamental shift in that activity .",1,2025,0.5183939337730408,Negative
2,8,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS,question," got it. and my follow-up question is this. so there's been increased questions from investors about how global investment banks like goldman, how the standing is impacted by some of the policy volatility , if you will, in terms of your internationally sourced revenues. and we had sort of two dif ferent answers from your peers on friday . jamie was a little bit more pessimistic. ted was a little bit more optimistic about the international revenue outlook going forward, given all of the global policy and david and denis, i wanted to get your thoughts on that, on whether or not what the us is doing could impact some of that sourcing.",1,2025,0.9520018100738525,Negative
