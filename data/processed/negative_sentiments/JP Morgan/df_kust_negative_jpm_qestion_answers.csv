3,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I guess I would direct you to my comments I think one or two quarters ago on this, but generally speaking that number i s pretty
correla ted to the short -term rate. So all else equal, you'll see a headwind in there as the Fed hikes come through which in general in the
geography, we would tend to expect that to be offset in NIR. But it's noisy. It can shift as a function of obscure balance s heet composition

to high inflation and the war in the Ukraine. How much was it due to inflation? And when you made that comment, is  it because you're
concerned about the lower end consumer spending more money for fuel and food that may lead to greater delinquencies down the road? And

30,0,Jamie Dimon,CEO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"But another very important point for shareholders, that number, when they –  that doesn't even remotely – the stress loss doesn't even
remotely represent what would happen under that kind of scenario. And I'm not s aying the Fed says it should or shouldn't, but I would tell you
we'd make money under that scenario. We wouldn't lose, I think they had us losing $44 billion. There's almost no chance that that would be
true.

good evidence, we didn't lose money after Lehman, we didn't lose money in the great – what just happened. We didn't lose money in great
financial recession.

more on what we think that buffer should be because we have so much – what I think is so much excess c apital. It ju st causes huge confusion
about what you should be doing with your capital.

uncertainty around ge tting th e pipeline completed or not and just assuming it might get done until we know better?",2022,2,question,0.6304844617843628,Negative
43,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"...right. Exa ctly. Obviously still running well below normal levels from the pre- pandemic period. But if you really want to kind of turn up the
magnification on the microscope and look really, really, really closely, if you look at cash buffers in the lower income segm ents and early
delinquency roll -rates in those segments, you can maybe see a little bit of an early warning signal to the effect that the burn- down of excess
cash is a little bit faster there, b uffers are still above what they were pre- pandemi c but coming down,  and that absolute numbers for the typical
customer are not that high.
And you do see those early delinquency buckets still below pre- pandemic levels but getting closer in the lower income segment. So if you
wanted to try to look for ear ly warning si gnals, that's where you would see it. But I think there's really still a big question about whether that's
simply normalization or whether it's actually an early warning sign of deterioration. And for us, as you know, our portfolio is really n ot very

starting point for the consumer that you bank, and the reserve build for loan growth in Card and the less than 2% loss rate in C ard lead us to

15,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So there are definitely still opportunities to optimize. We're continuing to work very hard and it's a big area of focus. Some of that is
reflected in this quarter's numbers, but some of the other drivers of this quarter are what you might call more passive items , particularly in
market risk RWA. And yeah, but we shou ld be clear that although we've said that the effects of capital optimization are not a material
economic headwind for the company, they're also not zero. There are real consequences due to the choices that we're making as  a result of

61,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Thanks, Steve. So, let's do Banking first. So, I think the thing that's interesting about banking  right now is that the declines have been so
significant, obviously from very elevated levels, but even relative to just 2019, 2022 was a relatively weak year. And as we look into 2023, it's
possible that the actual economic environment will be worse than it was in 2022. So, that could conceivably make you pessimistic about the
Investment Banking wallet outlook. And to be sure, it's not as if we're super optimistic.
But it's important to note that part of the issue here is how quickly things changed in 202 2, specifically with respect to rates, as that affects the
debt business and valuations as it affects M&A and ECM as well. And one of the sort of necessary conditions for people to do deals or decide
to raise capital is just getting comfortable with valuat ions in the open market. So, I think there's a chance that that actually winds up helping in
2023 in the Investment Banking wallet. Of course, we don't know, but those are some of the things that we're thinking about.
Jeremy Barnum
Chief Financial Officer , JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A
Similarly, on the Markets side, obviously Markets had another very strong year, better than we'd expected. Since the numbers were so strong
coming out of the pandemic, we were expecting more normalization than what we actually saw . And 2022 had a lot of themes. I think the
active management community did well. That always helps us a little bit. And we had volatility with relatively orderly and continued Markets .
As we look towards 2023, maybe some of those themes will be a little bit less obvious and that could be a little bit of a headwind. But on the
other hand, it's not like the volatility is going away, and Markets seem to continue to be quite orderly. And a 4.5%, 5% rate  environment is
probably one where there's more tr ading opportunities than a 0% rate environment.
So, of course, we don't know. We'll see. I think you would have to probably expect some normalization there. The numbers are really very
strong in Markets. But we'll see. We'll see what happens.",2022,4,answer,0.6280593276023865,Negative

2,1,John McDonald,Analyst,Autonomous Research,"Okay. And then I wanted to ask Jamie – there's a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch – banks are going to stop
lending, even Jay Powell mentioned that as a risk. Do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending and i s that a reaction
that makes sense – that banks might be retrenching a lot here? Do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch? Thanks.",2023,1,question,0.69642573595047,Negative
16,1,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle. And I think notably, we didn't loosen our underwriting standards when all the
numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic, and we're not going to overreact now and tighten unreasonably. Some of that co rrection
happens naturally – credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers whether in consumer or wh olesale, and that might make them leave our pre -
existing risk appetite, but we're not running around aggressively tightening standards right now.",2023,1,answer,0.9844110012054443,Negative
0,2,Ebrahim Poonawala,Analyst,Bank of America,"Hi, good morning. I guess, maybe one question, Jeremy. You reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for JPM. But, ob viously, you're
big players in the CRE market. Just give us a sense of when you look at t he two pressure points on CRE, one, how much is oversupply – and
that probably goes beyond office into apartments – how much of a issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years
going into a weakening economy? And how much of a risk is higher for longer rates in that if the central banks can't cut rates in the next year

29,2,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, Betsy, we really don't have any new information there, right? I mean, I think clearly if you go back like a year, we we re maybe a little bit
more optimistic that it might be across all the different levers a nd all the different pieces of it, closer to capital neutral. I think now it feels like
it’s likely to be worse than that. Hopefully, it’s not too much worse than that. And I would just remind you that there are a  lot of different levers,
so when the NPR c omes, that's only going to be a part of it, there's going to be other pieces – the holistic review. And it's going to take a lot of

there are a lot of reasons why it shouldn't go up. And JPMorgan – there's so much capital. I mean, so you can't look at JPMorgan and say,
well, it's a capital issue. And even the banks, by the way, whe n you look at it – even though some of the banks that are in trouble, they have
plenty of capital. Their issue wasn't capital, it was other things. And so I'm just hoping regulators are very thoughtful.
And the other thing is they should a priori decide what they want out of the banking system at this point because I've made it clear – I can look
at the banking system and say that no bank should keep a loan, if possible. That's how much capital is now being required for  loans.",2023,1,answer,0.5270695090293884,Negative

year and there's a debate about the lagged effects of the Fed rate hike cycle. When you think about – Jeremy, I think you mentioned your
unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago – how worried shou ld we be in terms of the credit cycle 6 to 12 months
from now? Or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe U.S. businesses, consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot bett er than we

31,1,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So actually, that Card income number, Steve, is a little bit of a one -off thing. So we had a reward liability  adjustment this quarter, kind of
a technical thing, so that's just a temporary headwind. And also, the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small p ositive one -off item

36,1,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. So, look, on pricing power, you're right – it really depends on the product and it depends on the competitive landscape across different
banks, and so it's very granular, it's very product -specific and in some cases we'll have more pricing power than in other cases. I think the
overall point that we're trying to make in connection with Basel III Endgame is just that like we think the capital increases  are excessive and it
puts pressure on retu rns all else equal, that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can. That is generally a bad thing for the
real economy and how all that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen, importantly sinc e we d on't actually
have the proposal yet – so we need those details. And sorry, Glenn I forgot the second half of your question. What was it?",2023,2,answer,0.8804213404655457,Negative
37,1,Glenn Schorr,Analyst,Evercore,"Actually, I think you hit on it so I'll just do a follow -up on a related. So the notion of private credit doing large traditional investment -grade
lending activity is maybe part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price. In Jamie's letter, you tal ked about the downside
– or my question is what's the downside if more of the mortg age credit asset -backed intermediation business is pushed out of the banking

38,1,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"I mean, I guess it depends on what you mean by downside. But I just think societally speaking, I think we've seen in recent history that when
home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad, when you have economic downturns, it produces b ad
outcomes for individuals and homeowners and society as a whole, and Jamie has written about this extensively. Beyond that, financially,
we've talked about how mortgage lending – I mean, the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical and the recent past has actually
been very profitable, then it was less so. Like, the correspondent channel right now is a ctually picking up a little bit. But it's a thin -margin
business, it's challenging. And when you increase the capital requirements, it makes it even harder so that just becomes one of the areas
where you're in that tension between remixing versus pricing p ower that we talked about a second ago.

56,1,Matt O’Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Good morning. So I'm in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here. But I guess what wo uld make you
change your rates meaning fully? So the top two banks have about 50% consumer market share, loan -to-deposit ratios are low. Your outlook
for loan growth, and I think others, is fairly sluggish, at least outside of Card. I get that it's common sense, and that's w hat we've seen
histo rically. But there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just don't ne ed to pay that
much for deposits for a slew of reasons. So what would make you change that?",2023,2,question,0.9986238479614258,Negative
1,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. Thanks, John. I think the themes are pretty much the same as we've seen in prior quarters. So, as we talked a little bi t about on the
press call, we've been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we don't think the current levels are sustainable and we do think
that we'll have to reprice in some pockets to some degree, maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future. A nd, of course, that hasn't
happened yet this year, so that's one factor.
In the meantime, the CD strategy is working well. We're getting – continue to get very good feedback from the field and we're capturing money
in motion, and so we're seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of CD migration.
But that’s sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan, I would say.
In terms of higher -for-longer, I think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration
and possibly moderate effects. And in the end, as we always say, we’re going to price products as a function of the competiti ve market
environment.",2023,3,answer,0.9152216911315918,Negative

57,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"You want to start? Okay. So, I mean, on green shoots, you'll just note that our comments are cautious. I mean, there is momen tum. I do think
we are a little bit more optimistic than we were, but obviously, markets have bee n bumpy, both equity markets and rate markets have been
very whippy recently. So we don't want to get too carried away with optimism here. We are coming in off a very low base and s o there's a
hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalizatio n and improvement. And of course, the overall economic picture at least
currently looks solid, this sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening. So those are all reasons to be a lit tle bit optimistic in the
near-term, but it's tempered with quite a bit of caution.",2023,3,answer,0.9194144606590271,Negative
58,0,Jamie Dimon,CEO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"So I would add a question. There has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system, and you can't look at, and
of course, it can drive markets in sentiment and sales and profits and all that, but you can't stay like this forever. Betwee n QT, if you never had
and how much the fiscal stimulus could continue at this rate before you h ave kind of the crowding out kind of factor. So I think people have to
be very cautious, and of course, the geopolitics I think is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with. How do you prep are the company
for that?
We do 100 stress tests a week, an d we do multiple views of it, including geopolitical problems, interest rate problems, but usually, geopolitics
presents itself as a deep recession or a mild recession, or a recession part of the world, or markets going down a lot, and b ecause markets do
well is not a reason, ever, to say that they are going to continue to do well.
If you don't believe me, remember 1987, 1990, 1994, the year 2000, the year 2009, and people don't predict those inflection p oints. But my
caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there. You just got to be very cautious with what you're facing. And like I said, the other
thing about the green shoots, regardless of that, we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out, better products and
better services, securely, safely, and all those things, so that's the ultimate goal.
We know there are going to be bad times. That's not a surprise that there are going to be bad times. We don't always know how they're
coming, and where they're coming fro m, but we'll keep on serving clients and doing good for clients, you can build a good business kind of

might help, but the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple or few years.  So, I know you always

access in the last year, that was more of an earlier effect in terms of having that drive revolver utilization. I think the main driver the re is just a
little bit of residual anxiety in the C -suite, which increases as the companies get smaller in size.
So, it's really going to be a function of how 2024 plays out. The softer the landing is, the more supported the utilization should be, I woul d
think. If things turn out a little bit worse, I think management teams are going to be incrementally more cautious about CapE x and so on, and

31,1,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Right. So, I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the
leverage lending space, is that they are exceptionally tight. So, I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days.  But bro adly throughout
the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, wh ere losses in OCI that
we would've had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in  the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with
the big run -up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary
markets.
That, I think, has manifested itself a little bi t in the leverage lending space in the normal way that it does, and that there's a lot of competition
among providers for the revenue pool, and you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms which always makes us a little bit concerned. And
as we have  in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromis e on
structure there. So, you are seeing a little bit of that.
I think that, away from the leverage lending space in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I thin k, in no small
part, as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disc iplining a little bit their lending, you're
seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived ove r the last few weeks,
and  it was little bit hard to observe in any case .
But I would say broadly, the dynamics are the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the f act that overall
asset prices and conditions are quite supportive and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot .",2024,1,answer,0.8015815019607544,Negative

organically would be through the trading book or the loan book. So, maybe two questions there. One, trading assets were up 20% year -over-
year. Is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand? And is there further opportunities to grow that?
And then, secondly, outside of Card, loan demand has been quite weak and any thoughts from yo u on if you're seeing any change in demand

37,1,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"So I think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because what's happened is that it's become normal, so
meaning – I mean, I think we're getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic, but maybe one last time . One
of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into T&E as people did a  lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadn't done
before, and everyone was going out to dinner a lot, whatever. So you had the big spike in T&E, the big rotation into discreti onary spending,
and that's now normalized. And you would normally t hink that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers
battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment. But given the levels that it started from, what we  see it as is
actually like normalizatio n. And inside that data, we're not seeing weakening, for example, in retail spending.
So overall, we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on sol id footing and
consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of no -landing scenario economically. But obviously, as we
always point out, that's one scenario and there are many other scenarios.",2024,3,answer,0.7817420363426208,Negative

21,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, it's a good question. And I think given the significant improvement in business sentiment and the general optimism out there, you might
have expected to see some pickup in loan growth. We are not really seeing that. I don't particularly think that's a negative. I think it's probably
explained by a combination of wide-open capital markets, and so many of the larger corporates accessing the capital markets and healthy
balance sheets in small businesses and maybe some residual caution. And maybe there are some pockets and some industries where some
aspects of the policy uncertainty that we might be facing are making them a little bit more cautious than they otherwise would be about what
they're executing in the near-term. But, we'll see what the new year brings as the current optimism starts getting tested with reality, one way or

crosscurrents. Like, if we anchor to the fact that you have a new administration that's taking place or take office with a focus on domestic
CapEx. Even if we don't get any rates cut, when you look through your customer base where do you see areas of vulnerability, be it because of
tariffs, be it because of just lack of any additional relief from the Fed? Yeah, would love to hear just from a credit quality perspective what no

the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, sub-prime, credit card. So, really, it's your forecast of unemployment, which you have to make
your own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said, vulnerabilities, it's unemployment, but the worst case would
be stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board. We're not predicting that, but

supplement, and probably our empirical EaR is a little bit higher than our modeled EaR as a result of the relatively low – lower than modeled
rates paid in Consumer. So when you put that together, all else equal, the drop in the weighted-average IORB, which is about 22 basis points,

28,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, it's a good question and we're seeing that too. So let me talk about travel. I mean we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are
seeing as headwinds for them, specifically in airline travel, and we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's
necessarily an indicator for broader patterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend.
And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading
of spending, specifically in items that might be – have prices go up as a function of tariffs. So you see people behaving rationally, and I have
noted even you hear anecdotes, and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising we have pre-tariff inventory and so on and so
forth. So it's not that surprising that you're seeing that a little bit in the spending data.
The other thing that people are kind of interested in this space is like what's happening by income band, because we have seen some of the
retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower income segment. And I think when we look at our Card data and also our cash
buffers and peoples' checking accounts, of course, it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower income segment. But when you take a step
back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the margin and cash buffers are
lower, and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments. But actually, some of
the increases in spending that we're seeing in April are actually coming from the lower income segment. So no evidence of distress, I would
say.",2025,1,answer,0.8809356689453125,Negative
