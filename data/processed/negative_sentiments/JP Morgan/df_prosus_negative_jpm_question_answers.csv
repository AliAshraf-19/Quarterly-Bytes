49,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Sure. So, I mean, as you know, obviously, we tend to break down our expenses across our three categories. And in some sense, the category
that you're addressing is the volume - and revenue -related expense, which we highligh t because it should, pretty symmetrically, respond to a
better or worse environment and thereby contribute to operating leverage.
So, for example, in this year's ultimate outcome and the number that we wound up printing for 2022, the year -on-year change i n volume - and
revenue -related expense, we're still refining the numbers, we'll probably show you more at Investor Day, but is probably close to $1 billion – in
other words, year -on-year decline. Whereas next year we're assuming something more like flat. So , while the sort of year -on-year dollar
change in the outlook sort of 2021 to 2022, 2022 to 2023 is comparable, the mix is quite different actually.
And so, for example, if we wound up being wrong about the type of environment that we're budgeting for, you would expect a significant drop
in the volume - and revenue -related expense number that's in the current outlook, and that would contribute to operating leverage. For the rest
of it, we're always generating efficiency, and we've worked ju st as hard at that whether the revenue environment is good or bad.
And as you know, we invest through the cycle. And so, broadly, our investment plans really shouldn't be that sensitive to sho rt-term changes
in the environment. Of course, certain types of  things like marketing investments in the Card business in particular, the math of what we
expect the NPV of those things to be through the cycle may change in a downturn, and that could produce lower investment, all  else equal.
But the core strategic inve stments that we're making to secure the future of the company are not going to get modified because of the ups and
downs of the environment.",2022,4,answer,0.6656309366226196,negative

70,0,Matt O’Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"I guess a bigger picture question – we've seen such a drop in really 5, 10 -year part of the curve and even further out. And banks aren't really

77,0,Andrew Lim,Analyst, Societe Generale,"Sure. Okay. Let's drill down into NII then. I just want to square a few comments you made there, Jeremy. So, if I heard you correctly, I think
you are sort of talking about sequential increases in NII, so I guess looking towards like $20 billion plus for 1Q, maybe eve n 2Q. So, I guess
we're hitting about $40 billion for 1H and then a sharp drop -off as, say, deposit costs increase and maybe we get a few Fed Fund rate cuts as

16,1,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And we always say, right, we underwrite through the cycle. And I think notably, we didn't loosen our underwriting standards when all the
numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic, and we're not going to overreact now and tighten unreasonably. Some of that co rrection
happens naturally – credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers whether in consumer or wh olesale, and that might make them leave our pre -

42,2,Matt O’Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Good morning. You guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely hig her credit card

8,1,Jamie Dimon,CEO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And I would just add that the 5.8% is not our predic tion. That is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have
to use which are hypothetical for CECL. So you have this prediction that's going to always look something different and we do n't know the
outcome. We try to be really clear  here – the consumer is in good shape, they're spending down their excess cash – that's all tailwinds. Even if
we go to a recession, they're going with rather good conditions, low borrowings and good house price values still. But the he adwinds are
substant ial and somewhat unprecedented. There's war in Ukraine, oil and gas, quantitative tightening, unprecedented fiscal needs of
governments, QT which we never experienced before. I just think people should take a deep breath on that. We don't know if th ose thi ngs

31,1,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So actually, that Card income number, Steve, is a little bit of a one -off thing. So we had a reward liability  adjustment this quarter, kind of
a technical thing, so that's just a temporary headwind. And also, the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small p ositive one -off item

65,1,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,Portales Partners,"Morning. Jeremy, on page 4 of your presentation, you show some liquidity metrics. And there's been a meaningful deterioration , or I shouldn't
say deterioration, depletion of some of that excess liquidity, obviously for First Republi c primarily. So my question is how quickly do you want
to rebuild that liquidity because as I look out towards 2024, there's probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium
event – to have excess liquidity? So that's my first que stion. What's your plans for replenishing that liquidity?",2023,2,question,0.5589897036552429,negative
68,1,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,Portales Partners,"All right. So sort of wrapped into that as a follow -up, if you take your $87 billion forecast for NII this year, and that implies at least one quarter
of maybe $22 billion of NII, and you take your eventual forecast of mid -$70 billion of NII at some point in the future, that would imply at least
one quarter of $18 billion of NII so  that's about an 18% drop. And if you hold the balance sheet steady, you're talking about a 30 -basis point

drop in your margin, your NIM, to get from $22 billion to $18 billion. I mean, what is driving – is it really the deposit or are you thinking in term s

81,0,Matt O’Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Hi, good morning. You talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question. But just how do you think
about cost control overall, looking at the medium term? The outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest inc ome. Fees
might help, but the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple or few years.  So, I know you always
say you want to invest for the cycle, and it's really paid off over time, but how are you thinking about cost control the nex t few years?",2023,3,question,0.9047799706459045,negative
82,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. I mean, I wish I had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework. But in some fundamental sense, we just kind of don't agree
with the framework in the sense that and we've been through this over the last couple of years, right? In a world where rates  drop very
suddenly and recover like quite dramatic ally, and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds, and you've seen these very significant
fluctuations in capital markets. We  saw that in 2021 going into 2022 where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for
reasons that can be  largely out of your control.
And while of course there are parts of our expense base, which are in the short term directly sensitive to the revenue enviro nment and some
of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes, but other things are much more structural. And
the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle ret urns are. So we're
always very focused on  cost. You can be rest assured of that. That discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget
cycle. But there are long -term plays and you really shouldn’t expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response t o a
lower revenue environment where we didn’t balloon the costs when the revenue became as we’ve argued unsustainably high.",2023,3,answer,0.44406062364578247,negative
1,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Matt, not particularly updating. I think you're referring to that $80 billion number that we'd put out there, and I wou ldn't exactly describe
that as an outlook. I think it's more just a number that we put out there to try to quantify a little bit the extent of the over earning . So, not
particularly necessary to revise the number. But I just would point out, again, as we highlight on the page, and as I hig hlighted in the prepared
remarks, that when you look at that $94 billion exit rate and full year guidance of $88 billion, that implies obviously exiti ng below $88 billion and
some significant sequential decline. So, in that sense, you can see us kind of ma rching on the path to that $80 billion. Whether we ever get to
the $80 billion or not and when is maybe a topic for later in the year or next year .",2023,4,answer,0.6140604019165039,negative
7,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Actually, John, this quarter, that's all like pretty quiet. So, the weighted average unemployment rate number is still 5.5%. We didn't have
any really big revisions in the macro outlook driving the numbers, and our skew remains as it has been – a little bit skewed to the downside.
Just recognizing that we still see risks being elevated, which obviously you can see that skew in the difference between the weighted average
unemployment of 5.5%, and what's in our central outlook, which I think is somethin g like 4.6% (sic) [4.4%]  peak of the current levels.",2023,4,answer,0.5285974740982056,negative
12,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Both good questions. So let's do reprice first. So, I think all else equal, this more dovish Fed environment and these six cuts has the
effect of taking a little bit of pressure off the reprice, especially product -level reprice. At the same time, we do continue to expect internal
migration, particularly out of checking and savings into CDs, and in Who lesale, a little bit of ongoing migration out of non -interest -bearing into
interest -bearing.
And that trajectory, I would expect to continue even in a lower rate environment. So, as a result, if you look at weighted av erage rate paid, for
example, for the consumer deposit franchise, we would actually expect that number to be a little bit higher, just even in a world with six  cuts.
And that's actually intuitive when you think about it, as people continue migrating into CDs, but maybe a little non -intuiti ve if you're kind of
trying to do beta type math with like change in rates and change in rate paid. It gets a little bit non -intuitive.
And then, in terms of balances, yeah, you'll note that I said that our outlook is for balances to be very modestly down , which when you
consider the QT, despite the various speculations about having it slow down later in the year, continues and that loan growth  in the system as
a whole is expected to be quite muted. It's a pretty modest decline outlook consistent with the lower rates. So, I kind of agree with you that this
environment is at the margin, a little bit more supportive for system -wide deposit balances. And then, obviously, we continue to be optimistic
about our ability to take share in deposits based on our cust omer value proposition across all of our different businesses .",2023,4,answer,0.38698285818099976,negative
18,1,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Good question, Gerard. I mean, I think you've heard Jamie talk about this a lot. QT is obviously a big focus and one of  the complicating
elements that we have in the current environment. I think that the math is the math in the sense that QT, all else equal, is withdrawing from
system -wide deposits. In the last six months of this year, that's been offset, hopefully, by a reduction in the size of RRP. And so,  that's been
supportive of system -wide deposits.
As we g o into 2024, RRP is at lower levels, and so that may be a little bit less of a tailwind. But it's also the case, as you know,  that there's –
the market's expectation is that QT is going to start slowing down at some point this year. So – and we still have reasonable levels of reserves
and some cushion from RRP. So, that's part of the reason that our outlook is for deposits to be modestly down, with the shrin kage in system -
wide deposits maybe partially offset by our belief that we can take some share. But, a lso I think the second half of this year is going to be
interesting to watch in terms of what the Fed does .",2023,4,answer,0.8692744374275208,negative
23,1,Manan Gosalia,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co.,"Great. And on the flip side, in C&I, you spoke about lower revolver utilization, more muted demand. What would it take for th at to rebound? Do

10,0,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global,"Hey. Good morning. Jeremy, can you speak to the trends you're s eeing with respect to deposit migration in the quarter, if there's been any
change? Have you seen that migration start to slow or not ?",2024,1,question,0.6502113342285156,negative
13,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. So, I mean I think the drivers of, let's say, what's embedded in the current guidance is actually not meaningfully different from what it
was in the fourth quarter, meaning it's the current yield curve, which is a little bit stale now. But the snap from quarter -end had  roughly three
cuts in it. So, it's the current yield curve, it's what I just said, the expectation of ongoing internal migration. There is some meaningful offset
from Card revolve growth, which while it's a little bit less than it was in prior years, is s till a tailwind there.
We expect deposit balances to be sort of flat to modestly down, so that's a little bit of a headwind at the margin. And then,  there's obviously
the wild card of potential product level reprice, which we always say we're going to mak e those decisions situationally as a function of
competitive conditions in the marketplace, and you know this obviously, but in a world where we've got something like $900 bi llion of deposits
paying effectively zero, relatively small changes in the product  level reprice can change the NII run rate by a lot. So, the error  bands here are

31,1,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Right. So, I think what's true about spreads in general, just broadly credit spreads including secondary markets and to some extent the
leverage lending space, is that they are exceptionally tight. So, I'm sure that's reversed a little bit in the last few days.  But bro adly throughout
the quarter, we've really seen credit spreads tighten quite a bit. You even see that a little bit in our OCI this quarter, wh ere losses in OCI that
we would've had from higher rates have been meaningfully offset by tighter credit spreads in  the portfolio. So broadly, sort of in keeping with
the big run -up that we saw in equity markets and the general sort of bullish tone, you saw quite a bit of credit spread tightening in secondary
markets.
That, I think, has manifested itself a little bi t in the leverage lending space in the normal way that it does, and that there's a lot of competition
among providers for the revenue pool, and you start to see a little bit of loosening of terms which always makes us a little bit concerned. And
as we have  in the past, we are going to be very well prepared to lose share in that space if we don't like the terms. We never compromis e on
structure there. So, you are seeing a little bit of that.
I think that, away from the leverage lending space in the broader C&I space, there was a moment a few months ago where I thin k, in no small
part, as a result of banks generally anticipating this more challenging capital environment and sort of disc iplining a little bit their lending, you're
seeing a little bit of widening actually in those corporate lending spreads. I don't know if that trend has like survived ove r the last few weeks,
and  it was little bit hard to observe in any case .
But I would say broadly, the dynamics are the tension between people trying to be careful with their balance sheets and the f act that overall
asset prices and conditions are quite supportive and secondary market credit spreads have rallied a lot .",2024,1,answer,0.7218534350395203,negative
36,1,Charles W. Peabody,Analyst,Portales Partners,"Good morning. A couple of questions on the First Republic acquisition. Some of us obviously thought that would be a homerun, and I'm glad to
see that Jamie Di mon validated that in his annual letter. When you look at the first quarter, it annualizes out to $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion,  above
the $2 billion that Jamie published in the letter. I know you don't want to extrapolate that.
But can you remind us what so rt of cost savings you still have in that, because this quarter did see expenses come down to $800 million down
from $900 million? And then, secondly, is there an offset to that where the accretion becomes less and less and that's why yo u don't want to
extrapolate the $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion? So, that's my first question .",2024,1,question,0.49730780720710754,negative
5,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. Interesting question, Steve. So, let's talk about deposit balances. So, yeah, I see your point about how balance pressu res are slightly
abating. When you look at the system as a whole, just to go through it, QT is still a bit of a headwind, loan grow th is modest and not enough to
offset that. And our PE seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels, and there are reasons to believe that it migh t not go down that
much more, although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves  into the system. But on balance net across all those
various effects, we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances. So, when we think of our balance outlook, w e see it as flat to
slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and gro wth ambitions offsetting those system -wide headwinds.
So, in terms of normalizing higher, I guess it depends on relative to what, but I think it's definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the
overearning narrative or the normalization narrati ve. Clearly, the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the
year, which implied a lot more sequential decline, is just the change in the Fed outlook. So, two cuts versus six cuts is the  main difference
there. But obvious ly, based on the latest inflation data and so on, you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield
curve. So, we'll see how it goes and in the end, we're kind of focused on, on just running the place, recognizing, and trying  not to be distracted
by what remains some amount of overearning, whatever it is.",2024,2,answer,0.5245591402053833,negative

47,0,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC,"Jeremy, I know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question. I noticed on the average balances the n on-interest -
bearing deposits were relatively stable quarter -to-quarter versus prior quarters wh en they’ve steadily declined. And this is one of the areas, of
course, investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers. Can you elaborate,  if you can, what
you’re seeing in that non -interest -bearing deposit  account? I know this is average and not period, and the end number may actually be lower.
But what are you guys seeing here?",2024,2,question,0.6939345598220825,negative
50,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. It's a good question. I think the short answer is no. We're not really seeing early signs of cracks in C&I. I mean, yes , I agree with you,
like the C&I charge -off rate has been very, very  low for a long time. I think we emphasized that at last year's Investor Day, if I remember
correctly. I think the C&I charge -off rate we've seen in 10 years was something like literally zero. So, that is clearly very low by historical
standards. And while  we take a lot of pride in that number and I think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of
our credit culture across the bankers and the risk team, that's not – we don't actually run that franchise to like a zero loss exp ectation. So, you
have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that. But in any given quarter, the C&I numbers tend to be quite lumpy a nd quite
idiosyncratic. So, I don't think that anything in the current quarter's results is indicative of anythin g broader, and I haven't heard anyone
internally talk that way, I would say.",2024,2,answer,0.553083598613739,negative
0,1,Jim Mitchell,Analyst,Seaport Global,"Hey, good morning. So, Jeremy, as you highlighted, full year NII guidance implies a sizable drop in Q4 NII ex. Markets about 6%. So, can you
just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit  behavior and pricing since
the 50 basis point cut?
And since it's related, I'll just throw out my follow -up question. I realize the forward curve is moving around a lot, but since Dan brought it up a
month ago, can you frame how you're thinking about the NII trajectory for 2025? Thanks.",2024,3,question,0.9151149392127991,negative
14,1,Erika Najarian,Analyst,UBS,"My first question, and thank you very much for answering all the NII questions so far, Jeremy, is just I guess another follow -up. As you can
imagine, once Daniel said what he said on stage in September, everyone is trying to figure out the over/under for net interest income next
year. So maybe a two -part first question, the second being inspired by what Jamie just said.
Erika Najarian
Analyst, UBS Securities LLC  Q
Number one, NII is expected to be down 6% sequentially in fourth quarter. I think year -over-year in 2025, consensus has it down 4% from your
new level. So it sounds like consensus still has room to come down, and based on the forward curve, Jeremy, it coul d be a little bit worse
year-over-year than the fourth quarter sequential rate. But that being said, as Jamie noted, we have no idea what the curve is going to  look
like. Right? It's gyrated so much. And so as we think about the curve, is it better for JPM organ to have more cuts in the short end but
steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve?",2024,3,question,0.9401403069496155,negative
35,1,Jamie Dimon,CEO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah. And also in the debt markets, rates came down, spreads are quite low, and markets are wide open. So it kind of makes sense that

63,1,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"No. Those were core NII or NII ex.. So again, reiterating at the time, the 2024 consensus was $91.5 billion. The 2025 consens us was $90
billion on NII ex. and our point was that that number, which remains an asset -sensitive number, indicated an insufficien t amount of sequential
decline year -on-year. The current consensus as we see it for NII ex. Markets is $87 billion. And as we've noted, that's closer albeit maybe s till

73,1,Saul Martinez,Analyst,Inc.,"Hey. Good morning. I'm not going to ask about a specific NII in 2025, but I did want to delve into the how to think about you r deposit margin in
volume dynamics in the CCB over the next few years. You have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit ma rgin, 2.6%, down about
30 basis points as deposit balances have come down, so it put some pressure on deposit NII. But deposit margins are still wel l above where
they were when rates were at levels that are consistent with where the forward curve now has b een going. So I guess how do we think about
both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down, say, to the level that are consistent with the forward curve? I know the forward
curve is likely going to be long, but that's the reference point we have.
And conversely, volume offset. You mentioned, Jeremy, the retail deposits becoming a tailwind. But, I guess, how much of a ta ilwind could
they be, especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits? So just give us a sen se of sort of the push and
pull of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit, the value of the deposit franchise.",2024,3,question,0.8628947734832764,negative

29,0,Matt O’Connor,Analyst,Inc.,"Good morning. It seems like you guys have backed off the view that you're materially over-earning on net interest income. And is this all
because of the higher rate environment that's expected now? Or is it also partly a different view on deposit pricing, specifically on the

45,0,Jamie Dimon,CEO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"I would just point the biggest driver of credit has been and always will be unemployment. That's both in the consumer side and it bleeds into
the corporate side. It bleeds into mortgages, sub-prime, credit card. So, really, it's your forecast of unemployment, which you have to make
your own, which will determine that over time. And so, the second thing you said, vulnerabilities, it's unemployment, but the worst case would
be stagflation. Higher rates with higher unemployment will drive higher credit losses literally across the board. We're not predicting that, but
you just asked where the vulnerability is, that's the vulnerability.",2024,4,answer,0.5553776025772095,negative
3,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, that's a good question, Ken. You're right. So if you remember, last quarter we said that we had one cut in the curve. I think latest curve has
something like three cuts. And so, we've talked a lot, obviously, about how we are asset sensitive. You now see our EaR disclosed in the
supplement, and probably our empirical EaR is a little bit higher than our modeled EaR as a result of the relatively low – lower than modeled
rates paid in Consumer. So when you put that together, all else equal, the drop in the weighted-average IORB, which is about 22 basis points,
should produce a notable headwind in our NII ex. Markets.",2025,1,answer,0.8586145043373108,negative
10,0,Jamie Dimon,CEO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Everyone trades stocks in a different way, so sentiment – but banks are a cork in the ocean when it comes to the economy. If the economy gets
worse, credit losses will go up, volumes can change, deal curves can change. And we're not predicting all of that. What I would say is our
excellent economist, Michael Feroli, I called him this morning, specifically to ask him, how they're looking at their forecast today, they think it's
about 50-50 for a recession. So I'll just refer to that. Obviously, if there's a recession, credit losses will go up and other factors will change, too.
And I think the one thing I'll add to what Jeremy said is – and I don't usually pay that much attention to anecdotes, but this time I am. And I think
you're going to see a lot of companies – you guys – not you, but the analyst community has already reduced its earnings estimates for the S&P
by 5%. So it's – now it's up 5% as opposed to up 10%. My guess is that will be zero and negative 5%, probably in the next month.
And then you're going to hear 1,000 companies report, and they're going to tell you what their guidance is. My guess is a lot will remove it.
They're going to tell you what they think it might do to their customers, their base, their earnings, their cost, their tariffs. It's different for every
company. But I assume you'll see that. And anecdotally, a lot of people are not doing things because of this. They're going to wait and see. And
that's M&A, that's M&A with middle market companies, that's people's hiring plans and stuff like that. So people have to adjust to this new
environment. And I think we'll see what it is.
I just also want to point out, just to – so you can round it up. This is to make you feel comfortable, not uncomfortable. When COVID hit,
unemployment went from like 4% to 15% in a couple of months, and we had to add to reserves in a two-month period of $15 billion. And then to
show you how stupid CECL is, in the three month – three quarter period, we took down the $15 billion. So, just – that just sizes up a bad
recession. If it's a mild recession, it will be less than that. If it's a really bad recession, it will be more than that. Either way, we can handle it and
serve our clients. Earnings won't be great and the stocks will go down, which I look at as an opportunity to buy back more stock.",2025,1,answer,0.5515977740287781,negative

28,0,Jeremy Barnum,CFO,JP Morgan Chase & Co.,"Yeah, it's a good question and we're seeing that too. So let me talk about travel. I mean we obviously saw the airlines discuss what they are
seeing as headwinds for them, specifically in airline travel, and we're seeing that too through the card spend. It's not obvious to us that that's
necessarily an indicator for broader patterns. There are a variety of potential explanations for the narrow drop in airline spend.
And as I mentioned previously, another thing that we are seeing looking at the April data is what would appear to be a little bit of front-loading
of spending, specifically in items that might be – have prices go up as a function of tariffs. So you see people behaving rationally, and I have
noted even you hear anecdotes, and I've seen evidence of companies specifically advertising we have pre-tariff inventory and so on and so
forth. So it's not that surprising that you're seeing that a little bit in the spending data.
The other thing that people are kind of interested in this space is like what's happening by income band, because we have seen some of the
retailers and other folks talking about weaknesses in the lower income segment. And I think when we look at our Card data and also our cash
buffers and peoples' checking accounts, of course, it is true that it is relatively weaker in the lower income segment. But when you take a step
back and you ask, are we seeing signs of distress in the lower income segment? The answer is no. So, sure, the margin and cash buffers are
lower, and you see some rotation of spend and spending is a little bit weaker than it was in the peak spending moments. But actually, some of
the increases in spending that we're seeing in April are actually coming from the lower income segment. So no evidence of distress, I would
