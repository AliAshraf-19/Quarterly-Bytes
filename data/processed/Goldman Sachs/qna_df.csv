0,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," so, trading question, i mean, markets business has been great, markets have been supportive. but i guess my question is to your comments on the regulatory perception perhaps of trading in general, and august looked like a spike in volatility , but looks like you did really well. this marks many quarters that you and others have done very well for years. do you feel the business is managed better? do you feel like your results mean anything towards the outcome on the regulatory side? i'm just curious on what the - if the evidence matters.",3,2024
1,0,David Solomon,answer,answer," i appreciate the question, glenn, and i mean, it's a hard question to answer . i think we've been clear on some of the advocacy we're doing around the regulatory process, but i've also been clear on regulatory environments, ebb and ﬂow and that people can be policy . and so, overtime, you see shifts in all this. and our job, and i think we've done this ef fectively over a very long period of time, is to adapt and adjust and be nimble to the dif ferent regulatory environments. with respect to the business of markets which includes fic intermediation and fic ﬁnancing and equities intermediation and equities ﬁnancing, i think we have an extraordinary leading franchise that we've invested in over a long period of time. w e have deep, deep client relationships, clients who rely on us for a package of services and that's not going away . and certainly , in this environment, this is an environment that's ﬁlled with uncertainty their need to constantly be engaging and repositioning and reshaping continues to make them very , very active on a broad global scale. i think that we've done a number of things to evolve the way we run the business over time that i think have made the business more durable. certainly , our focus and our emphasis on ﬁnancing and the way we've grown and managed the ﬁnancing businesses puts a level of durability into the business that's different than when the businesses were predominantly intermediation businesses. but intermediation continues to be an important service. and when you really step back and you step out a quarter-to-quarter and you look more year-to-year or year- over-year , these are very broad franchises across numerous silos, and they tend to be more resilient and more consistent than one might see when you look quarter-to- quarter . so, we feel good about the way the franchise is positioned, we’ll continue to invest in it and grow it. i think one of the things that people forget is that these businesses are correlated to growth in the world. they're correlated to market cap growth in the world. and as long as you believe, over the medium and long-term, those trends will continue with our capital generation we have the ability to invest in those franchises and grow those franchises over time, and we continue to see attractive return opportunities to do that. how the regulators respond to that over time, i really think is a separate question. and we'll continue to be actively engaged, as we've said to you, we are to ensure that we can manage that appropriately .",3,2024
2,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," i appreciate that. this one will be a short follow-up. with hpi was weak, but that'll happen on any given quarter . i think if you look over a long period of time, you've earned good returns on your historical principal investments. but as that book shrinks the 10.9 that's left, the 4 billion attributed to it, if i take a, should i -- is it okay to take a historical roe-ish on that capital to think about the lower revenue corresponding to the lower book going forward on hpi?",3,2024
3,0,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," glenn, its denis. i guess what i would suggest you take a look at, we have obviously a commitment to reducing the balance of the historical principal investments. and as we continue to have success doing that, there will be less revenue associated with the positions that have now been moved of f of the balance sheet. but you will still see revenue generation associated with some of the co-invest positions that we retain as a piece of driving our overall growth of our third-party fund management business as to guidance on future projected returns on that portfolio, i don't think i have a good answer as to exactly what future returns will be relative to prior returns, but i would suggest to you that we have a very diversiﬁed portfolio of exposures and a long-standing track record of delivering good returns for our clients.",3,2024
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," i just had a follow-up ﬁrst on trading and maybe david would appreciate your perspective around when we read about non-bank trading venues, getting into ﬁxed income markets, potentially sort of disrupting the business for the incumbents. comment on that if you may - you could in terms of other parallels to the equity business that we should draw? and how much of a competitive threat are the non- bank/non-regulated entities, especially given your comments around the regulatory backdrop and kind of the basel end-game, reproposal and the opaqueness around that? thank you.",3,2024
1,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. sure, ebrahim, and i appreciate the question, and this gets a lot of attention, particularly in the press. but i think there are a couple of things when you stand back that are important to think about. and look, the equities journey is a relatively good journey . there's been lots of -- ﬁrst of all, there's lots of competition in all these businesses. there's always been competition, but there are very few platforms that offer the leading capital allocators and asset managers in the world, the scale and the breadth across all the services that they need in an integrated basis. and that's very, very important to those clients when you go out and you talk to those clients. there can always be competition and there always will be competition. i just highlight, our equity business is as large and as scaled and as proﬁtable as ever . even though over the last 25 years, there's been enormous competition in the equity business. there's been digitization, there's been changed, there are now a handful. by handful, i'd say less than a handful. there are now one or two players that are trying to compete in some of the credit spaces, et cetera. and will they compete and will they win business? of course, they'll win business. but these are big, big markets. w e offer scaled solutions that are integrated for our clients and we continue to be enormous liquidity provider , ﬁnancier of those clients, which by the way is very , very important to them for the way their overall ecosystem works. so while these businesses always will be competitive and they continue to be competitive, again, we feel very good about the way our franchise is positioned to continue to be a leading player for our clients in these spaces.",3,2024
2,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," understood. and just a follow-up on -- back to roe and conversations with investors around, you have done a good job over the last year or two, performance has been strong. stocks reﬂected that. as we think about the journey here from a 12%, 13% roe to something that's maybe 15% plus, what are the building blocks one could argue that the market backdrop, not the best, but not the worst? what needs to happen for goldman to get to a point where we are registering a 15%-type roe on a more recurring basis? thank you.",3,2024
3,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, i appreciate the question. and we've been very clear , we have a mid-teens target and that we believe we are on the journey of executing towards it. i think the ﬁrst thing that has to happen is we need to continue to execute over a period of time to deliver on that. and again, i think it's a pretty simple building block of a story . first, we have a global banking and markets business, and you can go look at the performance over the last ﬁve years of that business and the returns that, that business has delivered. i would say that i still believe we have some tailwind dynamics around the investment banking activity , and i just highlight that while investment banking revenues have improved, and we've made progress, we are still not operating at 10-year averages in m&a  and equity volumes. m&a  volumes year-to-date are 13% below 10-year averages. now that's better than the 25% below 10-year averages that they were for the ﬁrst nine months of last year and equity volumes at 27% below 10-year averages. now that's better than the 34% to 35% that they were below 10-year averages for the ﬁrst nine months last year . but there's no reason why we're not going to get back to 10-year average is a tailwind, but you can look at the performance in banking and markets, and that's one building block in the foundation for mid-teens returns. the second is our continued progress, which requires more time and more execution on our part around asset and w ealth management. and while we've improved the margins, we still have work to do on the margins and also the returns, and we continue to be very focused. but we are conﬁdent over the course of the next few years that we can bring the returns of our asset & w ealth management franchise into the mid-teens. the next building block or the last building block is we continue to narrow our consumer footprint and the drag associated with the platform business, that will get to a point where it basically becomes negligible. it's getting closer to that. and so, if you put those building blocks together , global banking and markets, its actual performance with a little bit more of a tailwind, which obviously it beneﬁts from continued progress on asset and w ealth management, that is our business, and we should be able to deliver those returns. w e're focused on it. w e have more work to do, but that is the path, and i think it's pretty clear .",3,2024
0,2,Christian Bolu,question,question," can you hear me? i just have a question on the trading business and the competitive landscape. how are you thinking about the -- maybe the broader competitive landscape with the -- with other banks? your market share seemed to peak in 2022. it's been a bit choppy since then as a market share. just curious, are you seeing signs of competitors coming back, increasing competition from anywhere. i'm just curious on your thoughts there.",3,2024
1,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," when you have leading market shares, our global banking & markets franchise, you bounce around at dif ferent levels based on short-term activity , but what i'd say is if you step back and you look over the last ﬁve years, we took a step function up in our market share broadly across the plot. and so, from quarter-to-quarter , you'll see variability . but i still think those market shares are positioned in a leading position, and we're zealously focused on them. w e're zealously focused on the top 150 clients, which obviously make a huge contribution to the markets business. w e're obviously always focused on our overall banking footprint and the opportunities there. and obviously , in a better m&a  environment where there's more large cap m&a. you do see some movement in our market share. so that's a market share tailwind for us. they've always been competitive business, christian. again, we think we're very well positioned with our clients and have deep trusting long-term relationships and through our one goldman sachs operating ethos, a history of delivering for them through the cycle. there's always going to be competition, but we like the way our business is positioned. and i don't see anything that fundamentally changes that, but have operated in these businesses. w e've operated in these businesses for a long time. there are always going to be competitive businesses. chinedu bolu okay . on private banking, just another set of very strong results there, i think revenue growth up 10%. and if i'm doing my math correctly , organic ﬂows are in the high single-digit range, which would put you, i think, best in class. so just remind us again like what's driving strength there? and then maybe any key initiatives for growth over the next couple of years that should help sustain this growth.",3,2024
2,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure, i'll start. i don't know denis might have something to add. but at a high level, this is a strategic decision that we have this big ultra-high net worth platform, and we were underinvested in lending to those clients. and there's a lot of historical reasons for why that's the case, starting with the fact that 15 years ago, we want a bank. and so, we really didn't look at the world that way . but lending into an ultra-high net worth franchise is a very good business, and it's a very important part of the business. and we understand that we've learned and we've seen it through investment banking, and we've seen it through market that when you holistically look at the integration of services that you provide to your client, including lending, you improve your market share position. so, when you look at our wealth franchise versus under other wealth franchises, we've been underpenetrated the lending to those wealth clients and we put in place resources a leadership team on a focused ef fort to increase that activity to these clients. while we've moved the needle, we're still underweighted versus other competitors like jpmorgan, and i would expect that we have a relatively good growth trajectory to continue to invest in that capability for our clients. and denis i don't know if there's anything you want to add on that?",3,2024
3,2,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," the only thing i'd amplify , which i think we've mentioned before, we feel like we've run this play before. so, we worked on a strategy to holistically cover clients in banking by integrating lending as part of the holistic suite of services we provided them, improved our market share position with those clients. w e've implemented the same thing across the gbm public businesses of ficc and equities. we stand underpenetrated relative to peers today , and we believe that by taking the same holistic approach to the clients in the wealth business that we can improve our market shares and the nature of our relationship with those clients. as david said, we are allocating incremental resources, more specialist capabilities and giving our advisers the conﬁdence to of fer a competitive product to their clients to improve the overall relationship they have with their clients.",3,2024
0,3,Mike Mayo,question,question," the ﬁrst question relates to why do you stop platform solution sets of business line? and what's happening with the apple card? and do you plan to exit that and take charges for that? and kind of what's going on with that? again, two-thirds of the ﬁrm's global banking market, one-third is wealth and asset management, and then you have this kind of extra business there.",3,2024
1,3,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. thanks, mike. i mean i know there's a lot of focus on that. i think we've been pretty clear in our messaging that we are continuing to narrow our consumer footprint. i don't have a lot more to say about where we are with apple card other than we're running it and improving it. and that's really all that i have to say . but i think the direction of travel at this point is pretty clear .",3,2024
2,3,Mike Mayo,question,question," well, back to the core business then, you said m&a  is still 13% below 10-year averages. to what degree are 10-year averages less relevant because of the sponsor activity . you guys have said -- it seems like everyone has a dif ferent number , whether it's $1 trillion or $3 trillion of dry powder out there by sponsors that are ready , willing and able to pursue acquisitions. and i don't think you've ever had that level of dry powder before. so, could this be an m&a  super cycle because all that money gets put to work? and if so, how would you change that 10-year average to adjust for that?",3,2024
3,3,David Solomon,answer,answer," i mean, one, i think there are long-term secular trends around m&a  and market cap, which, by the way , are also meaningfully below trend i think that's more driven by the current regulatory environment and the fact that there has not been a lot of large-cap m&a  with the market cap expansion, especially around tap, that might be permanent. it might not, but my guess is that will ebb and ﬂow from time to time. but your sponsor point, mike, is a very , very good point. and the bottom line is the sponsors have been slower to turn on than i would have expected, but they will turn on. by the way , if that -- all that dry powder is deployed okay , m&a  volumes versus the 10-year averages will go up. but by the way , if we were sitting here ﬁve years ago, 10-year average was lower ﬁve years ago than it is today because the 10-year average is deﬁnitely correlated to market cap growth and economic growth. so, i do think we'll operate a 10-year averages. i do think over time, by the end of the decade, the 10-year average will actually be higher that it's been with a historical lens. but i will say at the point lower to deploy than we would have expected, but we see more activity . some of that is indicative of the growth in our backlog that we've highlighted. and i do think that sponsor activity will continue to accelerate over the next 6, 12, 24 months.",3,2024
0,4,Betsy Graseck,question,question," can you hear me okay? okay , super . yes, i totally agree. w e've been calling for capital markets rebound. it's really nice to see it coming through. two questions. one on the expanding loan of ferings that you mentioned earlier . and i know we touched on it brieﬂy in the q&a. just a few questions ago. what i wanted to make sure i understood is, when you think about the r wa impact of reducing the private investments that you're doing, you're reducing that portfolio and then increasing the expanded loan of ferings into asset & w ealth management. do you see that as r wa neutral is the density of the loan of ferings higher or lower than the investment, the private equity investments that you've got?",3,2024
1,4,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure, betsy . very good question. so generally speaking, the density of the hpi that we have left to sell down is high and the density asset and wealth loans is low . so, migrating r wa towards the lending businesses improves the durability , the predictability , the recurring nature of it, it brings forth the holistic access to the clients, all their wealth management needs and it is more capital efﬁcient for us. so that is an underpinning component of the strategy as well.",3,2024
2,4,Betsy Graseck,question,question," okay , super . right, because it's collateralized heavily , right? okay . then the other question i had was just on the gm cut. i wanted to make sure i understood this. so as far as i get it's signed but not closed yet. so, can you give us a sense as to when you think it's going to close? and are there any trailers in your p&l  when it does close, for example, anything we should be aware of with regard to either payments to on the contract to gm? or is there like a lot of cap that you have to be involved in? i'm just trying to make sure i understand how to model this as we go forward.",3,2024
3,4,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure, betsy . so, in terms of timing, it's signed but not closed. there has to be a conversion to the new issuer and then ultimately at closing of the platform transfer expectations we're targeting q3 of 2025. so that's sort of timing from a modeling perspective. and i guess what i would tell you, we obviously have responsibility for operating the platform until that point in time. so, we will continue to incur call it, the run rate operating losses associated with that business. as a guide, i'd point you to where we were in q1 and q2 of this year , something on the order of negative $50 million or $60 million per quarter , just to give you a sense for how that rolls forward from here until closing.",3,2024
0,5,Brennan Hawken,question,question," i wanted to follow up a little bit on the investment backlog commentary . i know you said that advisory drove a lot of the growth in the backlog. but we did see some sponsors recently to the ipo market with some success. and so curious about what you're seeing on the ecm and ipo side, particularly as we see early signs of sponsors reengaging with that distribution channel?",3,2024
1,5,David Solomon,answer,answer," so, thanks for the question, brennan. i mean there's no question equity activity picked up. but as i highlighted a few moments ago, volumes are still running 25% below 10-year averages. and ipos running even more signiﬁcantly below 10-year averages. i do think the sponsors, again, some of it is sponsor monetization. and because sponsors have had their portfolios marked a little bit higher , they've been slow and they're kind of waiting for growth to bring up some of the values. but i do see an acceleration of activity and i expect it to continue, and there's no fundamental reason why equity volumes ultimately shouldn't run a 10-year averages. and that those averages will grow over time with a growth in market cap and a growth in the deployment of sponsored capital.",3,2024
2,5,Brennan Hawken,question,question," great. and then we've seen several partnerships and some innovation getting announced in the private credit world recently . and given your heritage in that business, how do you plan to approach and prosecute that opportunity?",3,2024
3,5,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. w e have a very broad and interesting credit platform that is integrated in a one gs way , to some degree, on a dif ferentiated way than many of the people we compete with. w e obviously , as a credit originator in our investment banking business are one of the leading credit originators is not a leading position in leveraged loans and high-yield debt for quite some time and a leading position with sponsors and the origination of that, we obviously , we originate and distribute. w e also in our asset & management business, we are a leading player in private credit with $140 billion of private credit assets and growing and investing in that. i think one of the things that's interesting when you look at the discussion and the integration of this around the street, there is plenty of capital that is interesting in deploying into private credit. the valuable part of the ecosystem is origination channels. and there are obviously some private credit players that have interesting origination channels and paltforms. but i would say when you look across goldman sachs, our origination ecosystem across both our global banking & networks business and also in our asset & w ealth management business, is unique and differentiated and something that i think will continue to dif ferentiate the ﬁrm as we continue to lean into and grow our private credit platform.",3,2024
0,6,Steven Chubak,question,question," i wanted to spend some time just looking at or unpacking some of the self-help levers, recognizing that the business is still burdened by capital consumption from some of the noncore assets, whether it's in consumer or equity investments. denis, i believe in your prepared remarks, you alluded to an 80 bp drag on roe from consumer . and i was hoping you could maybe provide a more holistic picture, just frame the drag on returns from various noncore activities today . and are there any remaining self-help levers that could bolster returns which may still be on the come?",3,2024
1,6,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. i think the 80-basis point drag is the simplest way to understand the impact of those items, which we have identiﬁed as the selected items, which we have announced, we are in the process of disposing of. obviously , if we complete -- if we were to completely exit all consumer-related activities, there would be more associated capital relief potential. and we can obviously across the awm franchise moved down the vast majority of the hpi exposure, that currently has a little over $4 billion of attributed equity associated with it. so, you have the dynamic of sort of reducing the p&l  components. and then over time, we will remove the capital. so, removing the capital associated with hpi and then ultimately moving the capital associated with the consumer businesses that will provide incremental tailwinds to us over time.",3,2024
2,6,Steven Chubak,question,question," that's great. and just for a follow-up on buybacks. just stock is currently trading at 1.6x book, does suggest some expectation in the market for returns to get closer to mid-teens roe target. just wanted to hear your perspective on price sensitivity to buy back at current valuation levels and in anticipation, at least of david's response, citing prioritization of organic growth where do you see the most attractive opportunities to deploy capital organically today?",3,2024
3,6,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," our capital deployment philosophy unchanged. i think if you take some of our comments in the prepared remarks about the outlook that we have, some of the engagement we're seeing from clients, potential opportunities for the capital markets reopening to take the next step forward and see capital committed acquisition ﬁnancing, that is an activity that's very core to goldman sachs. w e have a historical leading market share position there given netting up our advisory franchise and our underwriting capabilities. and so that would be an attractive place for us to deploy incremental capital continuing to drive the recurring revenue streams across wealth and the ﬁnancing business and public is an attractive place to deploy capital. and that is our priority as we sit here today with our 90 basis point buf fer heading into the fourth quarter . but we also remain very committed, as we've said before, to sustainably growing our dividend. that's a core part of our philosophy . and we do believe it's important to also continue to return capital to shareholders. w e do have a higher valuation. w e do think about that. w e are sensitive to that, but i don't believe that our current valuation is such that we shouldn't be also returning capital to shareholders.",3,2024
0,7,Devin Ryan,question,question," question on just the alternative asset management fundraising. and looking at the fee rates. so, the largest at bucket corporate equity is seeing a declining fee rate since the end of 2022. i know there were some legacy funds in there that are sensing, but it would just be great to get an update on the outlook for the fee rates, just given all that fundraising that you've done in alts in recent years. and just when we should think about the inﬂection occurring as recently raised aum moves into fee earnings? and then we should think about kind of the right steady state because it would seem like out there.",3,2024
1,7,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thank you. appreciate the question. obviously , we put that disclosure out there, so you can track it and follow it over time. it's obviously very much mix dependent in terms of the nature of the particular at assets that are coming in thing which is a strategic initiative that is very valuable to growth of our asset management franchise, an important to a lot of our investment in our clients are the services we provide through our ocio of ferings. but in certain of those portfolios, we do bring on board some alts assets and the effective fee associated with that is lower than paid goldman sachs fund generated alternative fee. so, we have a multichannel asset accumulation strategy that we're deploying to grow the overall scale and scope of that business. and for us, having scale is an important contributor , ultimately , to driving margins, efﬁciencies and returns in the business, but not each of the channels comes with the same exact effective fee. so, you may see some slight variation in that over time.",3,2024
2,7,Devin Ryan,question,question," okay . and then just a follow-up on the trading business, obviously , results have been incredibly resilient and the ﬁrm has gained market share. and so, i'd love to get a little bit of a ﬂavor , if you can, just around how much of trading revenue today is driven by your electronic trading capabilities and how that's evolved over the past handful of years. i know there's been a lot of investment there, and you guys have some pretty dif ferentiated of fering. so, i just wanted to get a little bit of sense of that. and then how that plays into the story of market share from here just as you become more relevant with clients.",3,2024
3,7,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thanks for the question. i mean we look at equity and then frankly , even ficc trading activities, the strategy facing clients is multichannel again. so, we have voice. we have high-touch voice, and we have electronic, and increasingly , we're ﬁnding ways to integrate those activities to optimize ultimately the way that we can make markets and deliver solutions for clients. so, we have both, call it, run rate, more plain vanilla intermediation activities. now we have the capacity to either take on board more interesting structure or complicated trades with or without deployment of risk capital in the process. and the approach is to have a distributed set of channels across the public side trading businesses.",3,2024
0,8,Dan Fannon,question,question," denis, i want to come back to a comment you made about reiterating the $1 billion goal for performance fees. and i think you said $4 billion of unrecognized gains. you're obviously run rating well below that here year-to-date. can you talk about the time period you think to get to that $1 billion? and is there seasonality with certain maybe liquid products that are typically more recognized in the fourth quarter? or is this something that should be more pro rata?",3,2024
1,8,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so, the $4 billion is versus the stock of outstanding funds that are in process of deploying, completing harvesting and migrating their way to the end to their investment cycle. given a lot of the other commentary that we've been discussing about level of activity , strategically , openness of capital markets, in particular , equity capital markets, sponsor monetization activity , et cetera, as it relates to our portfolio where we own some balance sheet investments, and we own investments in funds, we have not had as much monetization in line with where the market has been generally . so as activity improves, we will also see more monetization and we expect that over the next several years, we will move towards those medium-term targets of a run rate, $1 billion worth of incentive fees. but i can't tell you exactly the rates that comes in, that will be dependent on how ultimately these funds harvest and when we're in a position to ultimately pay carry to investors and recognize our own incentive fees.",3,2024
2,8,Dan Fannon,question,question," got it. and then just a follow-up on wealth management, understanding the strategy of growing lending. but can you talk about the growth overall of the adviser base and how you're thinking about that over the next kind of one to two years in terms of net recruiting, hires and ultimately , investment in that business beyond just diversifying the revenue streams?",3,2024
3,8,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so, i think we have made a strategic decision that the investment in advisers needs to be a strategic and sustained investment program. so rather than having it a sort of ebb and ﬂow across dif ferent market environments or based on what the ﬁrm's perceived capacity to invest may or may not have been at dif ferent years in the past. i think part of the strategy of investing in what is a really outstanding business at goldman sachs, where we're the premier ultra-high net worth ﬁrm, we are making a sustained commitment to invest in advisers over multiple years. and so that is sort of a foundational underpinning of how we're looking to invest in that business. and when david makes comments about our ability to drive growth and returns across awm and that we are focused not just on margins and returns, but investing to grow . one of the places that we think is an attractive place to invest and grow is actually in the adviser footprint.",3,2024
0,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," can you guys share with us your goldman is in a unique position, i think, to be able to share with investors the beneﬁts of private credit. i think, david, you mentioned you have $140 billion in private credit assets. and when you see your clients choosing a channel to access monies from you, whether it's private credit or just lending. can you share with us the advantages that you see through private credit or the regular loan portfolio that your customers may beneﬁt from?",3,2024
1,9,David Solomon,answer,answer," so, i appreciate the question, gerard. i think one of the things that's interesting about this is, this gets framed in very binary ways. and obviously , private credit is a broad term and it refers to a lot of things. it certainly refers to a lot of investment-grade lending, a lot of which is on insurance company balance sheets. it can refer to direct lending in the below investment-grade business, which, by the way , is a component of our syndication activity and origination activity , particularly with sponsors. it can be direct lending for small and medium-sized enterprises. so, there's a wide range of things. when i listened to your question, when i pull away as you're asking in particular about leverage ﬁnance activity and how our clients choose channels in terms of where to get capital. and i'd say they don't go in through the bias, they're actually looking for a capital structure that works for their particular solution. and i think that one of the things that positions us well is we are a unique player that we have an ability to either syndicate and underwrite distribute. we have an ability to direct lend. w e have an ability to show clients alternatives that can best meet their needs and their might needs might be dif ferent in dif ferent transactional situation. so, we like our positioning there. i do say that i believe from a secular perspective, there will be continued growth in private credit, particularly in the leveraged ﬁnance space. and so, we're looking to capture that. but it's more complicated. there are dif ferent channels, there's dif ferent origination ef forts than sometimes the way this is all for trade. but we feel like we're well positioned across the spectrum to be a signiﬁcant participant in this space.",3,2024
2,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," and david, just a quick follow-up on that. that was very thorough. who do you ﬁnd these your primary competitors? again, you're in a unique position, i think, to be able to beneﬁt from this. who do you bump into the most?",3,2024
3,9,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, it depends what you're doing. so, it goes back to exactly what i said it, it depends what you're doing. if you're in the leverage ﬁnance market and you're looking at a syndicated capital structure and you're competing for that, you're going to bump into jpmorgan, for example. if on the other hand, you're looking at direct lenders, then you're going to bump into a bunch of people that play a leading role in that space, which can include people like hps or ares or other direct platforms. if you're looking at investment grade, insurance company balance sheet, you might run into apollo. i mean it really depends on who the client is, what their need is and what the activity is. and it's actually quite a broad and complicated space.",3,2024
4,9,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," i mean the only thing i'd add, gerard, if you just think about it, i think david has laid this out really well. if you think about where goldman sachs is positioned against this opportunity set. w e have capacity to lend to alternative clients, for example, who are deploying into the private credit space. w e have the capacity to underwrite and distribute dif ferent types of investment-grade and noninvestment-grade capital structures and we have the capacity to of fer investment opportunities to clients who want to get exposed to the asset class. and while we compete with all of those different parties that david enumerated, i'm hard-pressed to ﬁnd many people that have the breadth of exposure to each aspect of this ecosystem relative to us. so we really like our position in terms of the secular trends there and how we can support clients in each and every aspect of the continuum.",3,2024
0,10,Saul Martinez,question,question," i wanted to ask about the margin trajectory in asset & w ealth management. year-to- date, you're at -- you got a 24% pretax margin. you've already reach the mid-20s medium-term target. i know you've talked about that margin expanding beyond mid- 20s. but how do we think about where it can ultimately land in the time horizon around it? obviously , you're growing your all business, you have $4 billion of unrecognized incentive fees. you talked about the private banking and lending platform. just can you get to a pretax margin of above 30% like your peers? and again, how do we think about the glide path from here and the time horizon around that?",3,2024
1,10,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thank you, saul. so obviously , we've just arrived at our mid-20s target. i think it's important that we consolidate our position there. w e think there are plenty of opportunities to continue to drive that margin higher as we scale top line, as we improve the mix of alternatives across our platform, and we look to drive other operating efﬁciencies across the business segment. there are plenty of competitors that have margins as you cite, that are 30% or higher . so, our commitment is to continue to improve the margins. but we're also thinking increasingly about opportunities we have to scale and create value for the long-term. so, we are going to try and ﬁnd the balance between incremental margin improvement and making the right investment decisions that unlock long-term value in this segment. but for the time being, we think that both can be achieved.",3,2024
2,10,Saul Martinez,question,question," okay . got it. that's helpful. and then maybe if i could follow up on capital and just how you're thinking i know you talked about your capital strategy a bit. but how are you thinking about just capital allocation buybacks given the uncertainty around basel, we have a proposal, we have the speech outlining the reproposal. w e have an agency that seemingly one of the agencies, obviously , resisting seemingly the reproposal. w e have an election that could play a big role in terms of inﬂuencing whatever outcome happens. so just -- i mean, how are you thinking about your capital? and why do you think a 90-basis point buf fer is the write buf fer given all that uncertainty .",3,2024
3,10,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," okay . thank you. look, what i would say for the last period of quarters and years, we've been operating in an environment with a bunch of regulatory uncertainty . there's also been operating uncertainty as well. i think the economic trajectory , outlook and client franchise is coming more into focus frankly , that presents opportunities. so, we run a buf fer so that we have pent-up capacity to support incoming client opportunities. but we also run the buf fer given other uncertainties in the world, which include regulatory . as to when we will have the next bit of clarity and be able to interpret exactly what that means for our capital position, i couldn't tell you right now . but we have a long history of making adjustments to our activities when we get that regulatory feedback. from everything we know , there are generally time lines associated with those rules coming into ef fect. and we feel like this is the right place to run our capital to support the client franchise and be prepared for other unexpected developments, including regulatory .",3,2024
0,0,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," good morning. i guess maybe just david following up on the comments you made around regulations. like, when you talk to investors, i mean, we saw what happened with the scb last year . and i think there's been a laser focus on being more punitive on capital markets post gfc for many justiﬁable reasons. but just talk to us when you think about the regulatory outlook and i appreciate signiﬁcant uncertainty we're waiting for policymakers to kind of take new feed, but how do you think that plays out? and in particular , in terms of the operating backdrop for your capital markets business, investment banking business, like, how should we think about how could it be dif ferent over the next two to three years relative to the last ﬁve or even 10 years?",4,2024
1,0,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, it's hard -- i mean, it's hard for me to speculate given where we are, and i appreciate the question. it's something, obviously , we're spending a lot of time thinking about, but i think they're obviously -- when you talk about capital, there are obviously three avenues. first, there is ccar and you'd note the industry took an action because the industry doesn't think that the way ccar operates and the lack of transparency is appropriate or candidly legal. and so that's why we took the action that we did. the fed has commented that it plans to make changes in adjustments. but obviously , there are changes going on with the administration shift. there are changes going on at the fed. and it's hard for me to speculate how that will all play forward other than to say that the industry believes, as an industry , we believe strongly , and we believe this for years, this is not working appropriately at a system with more transparent and consistent capital that you can plan around makes a more efﬁcient and more productive system. and so we're hopeful that we'll make some progress with that. the second, obviously , is basel iii. and given the change in administration and the change of leadership inside the fed, our expectation would be that there'll be a different approach than what have been put forward. but again, we'll have to watch, and we'll have to wait. and then last, there's g-sib and the calibration of g-sib. g- sib was always supposed to be calibrated to growth in market cap economies it hasn't been. and so that's another avenue of dialogue. net-net, unpredictable. i don't want to predict. i don't want to speculate. but certainly , it feels like we're in an environment where there could be a constructive discussion about improving the transparency , clarity and consistency around this. and i think that would be very , very good, both for the system and capital markets broadly (ph).",4,2024
2,0,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," that's fair . and just a follow-up on the slide 5, you mentioned the forward catalyst, increased sponsor activity . we've been waiting for this. w e have seen some signs of a pickup there. you've talked about m&a  being sort of sub 10-year averages. give us a sense of just how quickly -- i mean, we know the doj, ftc backdrop will be more conducive for dealmaking, just how quickly could we see a more signiﬁcant ramp up around deals, ipos? is it a second half event? could we see that as early as the next couple of months?",4,2024
3,0,David Solomon,answer,answer," i think you're going to see it throughout 2025. i don't want to speculate where it will land versus 10 year averages, but it's certainly setting up to be much more constructive and robust. and the data set that we would have that allows us to articulate that is, we can obviously track our backlog, but we can also track increased activities, dialogues inside the ﬁrm. and i’d say there’ s been a meaningful pickup in large-cap m&a  dialogue and inquiry . there’ s been a meaningful pickup in sponsor inquiry and dialogue, and we continue to see strong positive backlog trends as denis highlighted to you.",4,2024
0,1,Christian Bolu,question,question," good morning, david and denis. maybe just follow-up, maybe take a question here. but if i'm reading the slides correctly , footnotes 1 1 and 12, which help bridge your roe gap to 15%. are you assuming sort of roughly $9 billion of capital return from hpi platform solutions to shareholders? because if you are, maybe talk through how that puts against things like slr constraints at that level of capital return? and then just more broadly on capital, just given the improving opportunity set here, how are you balancing returning capital to shareholders versus investing in the business?",4,2024
1,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. so i'll start, and denis will add, particularly on capital return. but our path to mid-teens is a simple analysis than what you laid forward. the ﬁrm is driving toward having two fundamental business platforms and we've been very clear on this as we've narrowed our focus, global banking & markets and asset & w ealth management. w e still have the legacy platforms, but we continue to make progress around that. global banking & markets, i think, has shown over the course of the last ﬁve years that this business should be mid-teens throughout the cycle. on asset & w ealth management, we've commented to you that we've met our medium-term margin, target margin, but we have not yet improved the returns in that business to the levels that we believe that we can return them. w e believe over the next couple of years, continued scaling and proﬁtability in our alternative platform combined with our ability to continue to grow management fees and at the same time, also free up capital from legacy principal investments will allow us to bring the returns in asset & w ealth management to the mid-teens or higher . in addition, platform solutions, where we still have the apple card platform, this year , depending on how you look at it, and i'll give you rough numbers was a 75 basis point to 100 basis point drag on the ﬁrm's overall roe, that will improve in 2025 and 2026. and so it's just math. if you have a mid-teens global banking & markets business, if we get asset & w ealth management, the mid-teens plus and we removed the drag from the platform that gets you to a mid-teens business. w e have a high level of conﬁdence in our ability to execute against that. denis will give you a comment. w e're obviously generating a lot of capital. w e do see opportunities to deploy . so denis will give you some comments on how we're thinking about capital deployment and also returns.",4,2024
2,1,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thanks, david. and christian, i think you're making references some capital release numbers. within the overall remaining portfolio of hpi, we do note that there's about $4 billion of retaining attributable – of remaining attributable equity . and then, obviously , over time, we both have to narrow the pretax drag in platform solutions and ultimately , someday may be able to release all of the equity associated with that business as well. so those are obviously contributors to our longer-term return target achievement. i think as it relates to capital return, as we sit headed into 2025, we have 130 basis points of cushion versus reg min (ph). as david has commented, as the ﬁrm believes there should be a signiﬁcant uptick in client opportunity . as always, we would look to ﬁll that demand as best we possibly can as a matter of priority . we remain committed to sustainably growing our dividend, and then obviously , seek to return excess capital. you all will have noted last year was a record year for capital return by goldman sachs. so we were able to grow the franchise, grow the ﬁrm as well as return record levels of capital to shareholders. as we head into '25, we'll support clients, invest in sustainably grow our dividend and then to the extent we have excess capital return it to shareholders, all the while managing an appropriate buf fer given some of the ongoing regulatory uncertainty .",4,2024
3,1,Christian Bolu,question,question," okay . got you. maybe david, look, kudos to you on the ﬁrm, you're clearly taking share across your businesses, whether it's markets or alternatives and in private wealth doing a great job. but just given to your point, the improved opportunity set here and perhaps more friendly regulatory environment. any thoughts on doing a strategic deal to accelerate your growth prospects within alts or private wealth?",4,2024
4,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," yeah. i appreciate the question, christian. and look, we always think about, particularly around our asset & w ealth platform, are there things that could accelerate our growth and journey and the overall mix of the ﬁrm. as i've said before, the bar for doing something is high. i'd also say , these businesses are sold, they're not bought. and at the moment, the market is valuing these businesses with an extraordinary amount of forward growth. but we obviously watch the space. and over time, could there be opportunities? yes. but at the moment, we’re very focused on execution. i think one of the things we’re so excited about for the ﬁrm is we have an ability to continue to execute organically on what we’ve laid out in front of you and continue to improve the returns of the ﬁrm. plus, i think as you point out, we have tailwinds from both the environment and improving environment for the kinds of activities that ﬂow into our ecosystem and also the overall business and regulatory environment. so i think execution right now continues to be our primary focus.",4,2024
0,2,Betsy Graseck,question,question, hi. good morning.,4,2024
1,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," good morning, betsy .",4,2024
2,2,Betsy Graseck,question,question," hi. i did just want to follow up on one thing here regarding the point you were making on platform solutions. it's a drag right now , 75 bps to 100 bps on roe, but '25 and '26, that will improve. so could you just step us through -- i mean, we know what your plans are for platform solutions. but i'm wondering what's happening in '25 and '26 that will drive the reduction of the drag in this year and next, if you could speak through that.",4,2024
3,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," yeah. at a high level, betsy , we're obviously -- the primary thing is in platform solutions is the apple partnership. as you know , we have a contract with apple to run that partnership until 2030, although, there's some possibility that it won't continue until that time frame. the most important thing that's happening is the card continues to improve and its performance and the card is driving towards proﬁtability . and so the improvement in the proﬁtability of the card has an impact on the short-term drag. ultimately , whether it's in the medium-term or through the life of the contract, that's not going to be a long-term business for the ﬁrm, and that will ultimately allow us to exit and return capital, but i'm really not in a position to comment any more speciﬁcally other than the direction of travel that you're aware of.",4,2024
4,2,Betsy Graseck,question,question," okay . great. and then separately on the changes that were discussed with regard to how you're structuring the ﬁnancing team that's within investment banking, if i got it right. could you just help us understand, how does this management structuring change the revenue growth outlook that you're looking for? like, why did this deliver better growth?",4,2024
5,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. so -- yeah. so ﬁrst of all, it's in global banking & markets. and so i think the way, betsy , you should think about global banking & markets, and we've been on a journey to really think about all the efﬁciencies that exist between what was the traditional investment banking business, what we'll call the ﬁnancing or capital markets businesses and then the global markets businesses, which are the trading businesses, and we brought them all together in global banking & markets. i think you should now think about that big business, that big $35 billion business as kind of having three big platforms. one is what we call traditional investment banking; two is what we call capital solutions; and three is what we call global markets or trading. the organizational structure that we're creating allows us, we believe, to take advantage of something that goldman sachs is very uniquely positioned at the fulcrum of which is this intersection between both public markets and private markets and the way you marry capital with issuers, but also marrying issuers and their need for capital with all dif ferent kinds of investors. and i think the thing that we're very uniquely positioned on is, one, we have extraordinary relationships with 12,000 companies in the world. two, we have extraordinary what i'll call public market ﬁnancing capabilities. but three, we also have an ability , whether it's through our balance sheet, whether it's through what you'll call traditional distribution channels into institutional clients or it's through our asset management platform and our own asset management products have a range of alternatives that we can marry to issuers to make sure they get the best product service and results. and so this is a way of getting that all coordinated in onegs fashion across the ﬁrm. and so we've taken the traditional ﬁnancing businesses and capital markets businesses. w e've taken all the coverage of ﬁnancial sponsors. w e've taken all the coverage of alternative ﬁrms in our trading businesses and we are putting them together and we're bringing talent that understands both our own balance sheet and capital deployment and the ability to distribute these products together to try to optimize our capability around that. and this is where we actually think there's going to be growth in the capital markets. and so our ability to capture more of that share, we think the setup allows us on a relative performance basis to do better .",4,2024
6,2,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," and betsy , one thing i'd add just in terms of overall ﬁnancials, obviously , our segments are not changing. the subsegments that we report into are not changing. these -- this sort of streamlined synthesized origination capability , we think will enable us to accelerate revenue growth by serving our clients more efﬁciently , but the suite of activities that are undertaken by these originators and instructors we'll continue to populate the same ﬁnancial line items that we have today . we just think this is a better way of organizing our people against the client opportunity set and doing everything else that david just enumerated.",4,2024
7,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," and look, if you go back in history , betsy , just to expand on it. i mean years ago, the capital markets business is 25 years ago, the capital markets business has sat in the trading businesses. and 20 years ago, it was a dramatic thing to put them in investment banking, so they were closer to clients. and so our mindset is always how do we organize our people and our resources, create a onegs ethos and be is connected to our clients to make the experience for our clients as seamless and is simpliﬁed and is leveraging as possible.",4,2024
0,3,Brennan Hawken,question,question," hi. good morning. thanks for taking my question. you spoke earlier to the capital unlock within the improving roes in awm. but some of the more business oriented components would be driving lending solutions within wealth and scaling the ﬂagship products and all, which i thought was interesting. i was hoping you could speak to lending penetration and where that sits versus your target within the wealth business and whether there's been an uptick in demand more recently , given some of the market developments and what contribution you're expecting from ranking the ﬂagships and maybe highlighting some of those franchises? thanks.",4,2024
1,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure, brennan. thanks a lot for the question. i appreciate it. so obviously , the strategy to grow wealth is three part in terms of primary focus: w ealth management, alts and solutions. within w ealth management, you enumerate one particularly attractive opportunity set for us, which is lending. and we've noted previously that we believe that we are relatively underpenetrated, relative to some of our competitors across our wealth platform. and we've been making investments in our human capital expertise, educating our client-facing professionals that we have capabilities and ambitions to support clients through lending activities. w e did grow our private wealth lending balance is about $5 billion on the year . we are committed to a multiyear journey of increased penetration. i think relatively , we are still very low . so we are making progress. w e are optimistic, but i think we have a lot of room to improve that. in terms of the alts business, there are a number of ways that we continue to grow and make progress in our alts franchise. it continues to be an attractive and appropriate component of our wealth clients portfolio. w e have very good manufacturing capabilities as a ﬁrm and also a robust third-party wealth channel as well that clients can take advantage of within the portfolio of alternative of ferings that we make available to clients. we have certain of our ﬂagship funds and those are raised from time-to-time, and those are attractive opportunities for us to secure client for deployment, and they also position the ﬁrm well as a known and credible deployer of capital. so we'll continue to raise those funds over time. and as we have more assets under management per strategy , if you will, better depth that will enable us to improve the overall operating leverage of that component of the asset & w ealth management business.",4,2024
2,3,Brennan Hawken,question,question," great. thanks for that color . and david spoke to some of the operating efﬁciencies when reviewing -- when giving the strategic update. it's interesting because how do we think about the push and pull of expenses and efﬁciencies as we move into 2025 given the expectations for pretty robust and all the indications you've given for a pretty robust improvement in capital markets activity or maybe if it's easier to answer , what's the right way to think about incremental margins on revenue growth as we move forward.",4,2024
3,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure, brennan. i appreciate that. w e're actually trying to do a number of things at the same time, which is what gives rise to your question. so ﬁrst and foremost, we continue to see good opportunities to grow the ﬁrm, and we expect that as we continue to grow the ﬁrm, we should be able to continue to deliver incremental operating leverage. you saw in the course of the last year that our efﬁciency ratio improved by 1,200 basis points. now it's on the order of 63%, moving closer to our target of 60%. so scaling the business, driving incremental operating leverage continues to be a huge focus of this management team. it's also the case that we see very attractive opportunities to make investments to scale the ﬁrm, to improve client experience, to improve our employees' productivity , and we want to be able to ﬁnance some of that incremental investment spend, a lot of which takes place in the engineering space by driving incremental efﬁciencies across the ﬁrm. and thinking about, as david ran through the ways we organize ourselves, the way we locate our professionals, the way we manage our spend processes, accountability this program that david made reference to has accountability up to the management committee of the ﬁrm. it's an important piece of how we focus on running the ﬁrm efﬁciently , and we think it's something that's designed to give us capacity to fund some of the investments that we think are the best ways to continue to scale the ﬁrm make it more resilient and improve overall client and employee experience.",4,2024
0,4,Mike Mayo,question,question," hi, david. there was another w all street's ceo who said he was the most positive he's been in 25 years. so how good could things get in your mind because you're saying the regulatory environment, the economic environment, the backlogs are up and that if i was doing a model for the industry , if we go back to the '21 pandemic highs? and on the other side of this, as highlighted by slide 9, you're all focused on expenses. and on the -- maybe if rates go up too much, what level of a 10 year yield do you think it puts a wrinkle in the kind of the bullish thesis you're laying out here, a 10 year 5%, 6%, 7%. what's the most likely thing that would drill your lofty expectations?",4,2024
1,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," look, mike, i appreciate the question, and i'd say at a high level, there's no question that i highlighted in my remarks. there's been a sentiment shift broadly as i talk to ceos since the election. but that doesn't stop us from at goldman sachs constantly thinking by nature of risk managers thinking about how the environment can change, how that can evolve. i think at the moment, for our business and our business mix, particularly , around capital markets activity , etc. w e have -- it feels like we have a tailwind going into 2025. and i do think that levels that have been below historical averages are going to a minimum normalize, maybe do better . i certainly wouldn't say , i have any expectation of capital markets activity going back to 2021, anomalies anytime soon, but it is a more constructive environment. and so that, of course, is something that we think about as we think about deployment of resources and investment in the business. now all that said, we can't predict the environment. the environment changes and we're running the ﬁrm for the medium and the long term. and so we are very , very focused on our growth and returns over the medium term, our growth of the ﬁrm over the medium term and our ability to serve our clients and execute well. and i am very conﬁdent, very , very conﬁdent that no matter what the world throws at us, goldman sachs over time will continue on that journey of doing really well and growing the returns of the ﬁrm and serving our clients with excellence and distinction. i think the environment feels good, but i'm not at all confused that i could wake up in three months and there could be things going on in the world that would change that perspective. and we're always thinking about that, always trying to look around corners and are always going to manage the ﬁrm for the medium and the long-term.",4,2024
2,4,Mike Mayo,question,question," and then speciﬁcally , i guess why is platform solutions still around? i mean you're number one in deal making and you haven't been able to work that out. and on the other hand, the ﬁnancing organic growth, how big is that today and how big do you expect that to be in ﬁve years, and what about credit risk that's related to that? thanks.",4,2024
3,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," yeah. on the ﬁrst question, i don't really have anything to say . it's dif ferent than what i've said about our journey around the consumer platforms in the business, but i appreciate the question. on the second point, we continue to believe that there's opportunity for our -- for us to grow our ﬁnancing business. our ﬁnancing business scales with growth in the world. of course, we're incredibly focused on risk management and credit risk and the scale of that business against our equity base and our balance sheet, etc. but as the world grows, we believe there's opportunity for us to continue to grow and scale that business. and i think we've proven that over time. i mean, denis, do you want to add anything around that?",4,2024
4,4,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," yeah. just i draw a connection back, mike, to some of the comments that david made earlier , which is, if really the secret sauce in driving some of these activities for clients is origination, distinction and dif ferentiation. the establishment of the capital solutions group enables us to have all of that origination centralized and we can, from that origination continue to grow the ficc ﬁnancing balance sheet in an appropriate risk adjusted fashion. we can underwrite and distribute some of that product to other investors across our franchise, and we can also help awm source investments that provide attractive risk adjusted returns to the clients at awm. so there's an opportunity to continue to invest in growing the ﬁnancing capabilities that we've been reporting on, but we also have incremental outlets for the origination excellence given the demand that we see across various types of investors around the market.",4,2024
0,5,Devin Ryan,question,question," thanks so much. good morning, david and denis. first question just on the banking and markets, market share, wallet share, obviously , incredibly impressive over the last handful of years. and i think just a testament to the execution. when we look at this kind of new capital solutions organization, it would seemingly better positioned with sponsor clients and just, i think, gives that indication of where you guys are going there. how do you think about your market share today with sponsors and not sure if you can give any framework or numbers there? and then, how you think about the ability to take share in that group and how important that will be to driving further kind of wallet share gains from here like you've done in the past? thanks.",4,2024
1,5,David Solomon,answer,answer," yeah. w e -- i mean, we've -- over the last 20 years, we've made enormous investment in our relationships and our coverage and sponsor community . we have leading share with the sponsors. i don't think we quantify it speciﬁcally . but we have - - it's fair to say , we have leading share with sponsor community . i think we're very well positioned as they're active to capture our fair share and even sometimes more than our fair share of that activity . what i'd say is, it's been an environment where they've been incredibly quiet both from a deployment perspective, also a monetization perspective, and that's just not consistent. i've said consistently that sponsors make money by doing two things: buying new things, selling old things. and so the fact that we've gone through a period of time where they haven't done a lot of either of those things, that will normalize over time. part of it was a reset in kind of valuation expectations. some of it was growing into valuation expectations that are kind of run ahead, but i do believe very strongly that the next 24 months will be a much more constructive environment to response to activity . and our share positioning with them is very good. i think these organizational changes will only strengthen that position.",4,2024
2,5,Devin Ryan,question,question," great. thank you. and then, just in terms of on the alternative asset management fundraising has been terriﬁc. how should we think about the pace of deployment of kind of that record fundraising and then just kind of the trajectory of kind of the acceleration in performance fees because it would seem that, that -- there could be a pretty big step function higher in performance fees, but you need to deploy that capital ﬁrst. so just the time line to kind of think through that path. thank you.",4,2024
3,5,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure, devin. so we're focused on that as well. and it's a good question because it hits a number of topics. so obviously , we had good success raising alts funds and surpassed all the various targets that we set out repeatedly , but now it's an opportunity for us to deploy . and the deal making environment and the transaction volumes moving to the market over the last couple of years being subdued has also impacted our ability to deploy into transaction. so as the overall backdrop improves, that should be a more attractive opportunity for us to start deploying the money that we've raised and drive our aus. at the same time, that same slightly more muted environment for transaction activity has been -- there's been less by way of monetization activity . and so as we, again, enter into, hopefully , a more supportive backdrop, there will be better opportunities for us to continue to monetize investments across our fund structures, and as we reach the end of investment cycles and fully monetize and become in a position to start returning capital to our investors, then you'll see the incentive fees start to come through our ﬁnancials as well. our incentive fees were up sharply on a year-over-year basis, but they're still short of our $1 billion annual target. our expectation is that we will continue to make progress towards that target over the course of 2025, the extent of that progress, obviously , will be a function of the environment, but we should continue to make progress towards the $1 billion target, given where we sit in the outlook that we have.",4,2024
0,6,Dan Fannon,question,question, thanks. good morning. i wanted to follow up on the alternatives. you talked about consistent levels of fundraising as we look at '25. could you maybe talk to the asset classes or the funds that you think will drive that growth going forward and how the fees may be dif ferent or are they the same as kind of what's in the ground of your existing book of alternatives today?,4,2024
1,6,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so given the breadth of our alternatives platform, the fundraising has come in from a number of dif ferent channels has been very diversiﬁed. and i think that's one of the strengths of our platform is one of the ways it positions us as one of the top ﬁve alternative players in the market. so as we move forward, we would continue to expect to raise money across the various asset classes within our alternatives platform. w e are not seeing signiﬁcant fee compressed, if you will. that's a question that we get on the alts side. so we'd expect to be raising the same type of funds with roughly the same fee structure, there obviously can be variations in mix. and so dif ferent types of alts products sourced through dif ferent channels bring with them dif ferent fees. so that can change average ef fective fees in the alts space. but in terms of our strategy , continue to raise a diversiﬁed suite of funds, expect a reasonably consistent volume and don't expect fees per type of origination activity to meaningfully change.",4,2024
2,6,Dan Fannon,question,question," understood. and then just as a follow-up, both asset & w ealth management revenues on the management fee side, we saw good growth year-over-year , both for the year and the fourth quarter . there was a little bit higher growth in wealth, both in the fourth quarter and the year . i guess, as you look at those businesses going forward, do you expect to see a divergence in either of those segments or do you think that consistently , they will both grow at similar levels?",4,2024
3,6,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so look, there are obviously dif ferent idiosyncratic factors within both the asset management and the wealth management sectors. w e obviously like the optionality to continue to raise and grow our management fees across both of those subsegments. and we re-underwrite our expectation that we will continue to grow awm management and other fees, high-single digits over the next several years. we've obviously outpaced that recently , but we sort of would re-underwrite our forward growth expectations to be high-single digits.",4,2024
0,7,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," hi, david. hi, denis. david or denis, can you share with us -- i mean, the outlook, many of us -- you folks included, i think, looks very positive for the capital markets businesses, the economy , etc. and aside from the geopolitical risks that are obvious to all of us. can you guys give us two or three risks where could derail this shared optimism we have for the outlook for the business?",4,2024
1,7,David Solomon,answer,answer," i mean the world -- i mean, i appreciate the question, right. the world is a complicated place, and there's a lot going on in the world. markets reacting can change their sentiments very , very quickly . we obviously have a new administration with that change. there are a bunch of things people are talking about that have people excited from a business environment, a lower regulatory touch environment, etc. but at the same point, there are a broad array of policy initiatives that can all have an impact on market sentiment and the direction of travel. and i'd say , at the moment, there's uncertainty . when you look broadly across immigration policy , trade policy , tax policy , energy policy , we'll get more clarity around all of this, but there are dif ferent outcomes. there can be sentiment shifts plus there's a lot going on in the world. and there are all sorts of signiﬁcant risk we spend a lot of time thinking about. w e think about cyber risk a lot. it's something we haven't talked about in a while on this call. so the world is a complicated place. fundamentally , at our core risk managers, we try to think about these things, make sure the ﬁrm is resilient and well positioned to navigate them. and i would say , at the moment, the environment is quite constructive. the economy in the u.s. is quite constructive still. but it's a complicated world. and i think we all should be on our toes and be prepared for the unexpected because i tell you every single year the consensus that people tell me in january , the year turns out to be dif ferent than the consensus. and i'm sure this year , there'll be some surprises to the ups, and there'll be some surprises to the downs as there always are.",4,2024
2,7,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," yeah. no, i agree with that. that's for sure. thank you, david. and then coming back to, obviously , you guys have been investing heavily in technology for years in driving those operating efﬁciencies. in slide 9, you talk about them, particularly in automation. and then you talk about leveraging the ai solutions. as outsiders, when do you think we'll be able to see the success that you're having with ai. i know there's probably early successes already , but will there become a time when we'll be able to say , wow , earnings were actually favorably impacted by x percent because of the success in the ai implementation that you've done?",4,2024
3,7,David Solomon,answer,answer," we are having early success. and this ﬁrm is zealously focused on its expense base and creating efﬁciencies that give us the capacity to invest in our franchise and grow our client franchise. can we get to a point where you can say it's af fected by this percent? i don't necessarily think that's the way to think about it. w e're going to continue to use technology to make the ﬁrm more productive. w e're going to continue to scale and create automation of platforms that allow us to deploy resources and other places will allow us to serve our clients better and grow our franchise. and that's something we're going to continue to be operationally very focused on. we've made good progress on it, but we have -- we see and we have and denis explained this in his comments and i hinted at it too. w e see lots of opportunities to continue to do that in the coming years. and i think the way that investors should look at it and think about it, it's that focus on that and the capacity it creates allows us to scale investments that can continue to strengthen the franchise. and so that's the way i think we think about it and we try to operate.",4,2024
0,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," so i want to talk about how we build towards that medium-term roe target. so obviously , for this quarter was depressed by the write-downs. let's start with a 9-ish starting point. w e know capital markets activity will be better in normal times. so i know we're a lot closer than it looks right now . if you look at page 7, where you spelled out the $3.6 billion of historical principal investments that declined in the quarter or if you want to do it year-to-date either way , my question related to that reducing capital intensity is in a good way , it didn't look like there was a big gain or loss related to those exits. a) is that right? and b) how much capital [r was] (ph) that you free up because i'm just trying to build towards that ultimate goal.",2,2023
1,0,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so glenn, thank you for the question. and i think in terms of our journey towards our through-the-cycle returns, there are a number of things that we need to do in terms of achieving the top line targets that we laid out at investor day as well as continuing to drive ongoing capital efﬁciency . the capital efﬁciency has been a project that we've been working on for a number of years. w e've had particular increases in those reductions over both the ﬁrst and second quarter . as you know , about hpi down $6 billion. and as we -- if we ultimately reach our target, we expect the total ae reduction to be approximately $9 billion.",2,2023
2,0,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. i just -- glenn, i just want to add 2 things, just looking at that because denis has focused on the ae and the continued journey . the one thing he didn't touch on was your question around the reductions and whether there were meaningful marks around that. there are some we’d reduced where -- it might be a public position, so we mark those public positions at market that night and you sell that position at a discount. so there could be a slight loss. there are others that are private positions where you keep a valuation adjustment or a discount to what you believe it's worth as you sell and you get a gain. but i wouldn't say there's anything material that i'd call out in the context of that process. but the important thing about the journey that i'd like to emphasize is we laid out clear in investor day that we were going to narrow the consumer ambitions and really focus on these 2 big businesses. clearly , at this point in time, given the lack of investment banking activity , our investment banking business is performing at a lower level of return and a lower level of activity than we've seen in nearly a decade. w e don't believe that's constant. w e believe that, that global markets and banking business can deliver mid-teens returns through the cycle and that obviously makes up more than 2/3 of the ﬁrm. in addition, marc nachmann laid out at our investor day , a very clear path on asset management to grow the top line of asset management ex the legacy balance sheet by a high single-digit percentage and we set a target to drive the margin which ex the legacy balance sheet up to 25%. at that point, that is a mid-teens return business. and as we continue to narrow the drag which we're making progress on in the platforms and i believe we'll narrow that to 0 and move past that, you've got these 2 businesses that are the ﬁrm that will be mid-teens through the cycle. so that's the way i'd think about it. but obviously , you need a better environment than this environment to see that.",2,2023
3,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," i appreciate all that. and maybe one just big picture. think a lot of banks that -- investment banks that have reported over the last couple of days have had varying degrees of optimism about capital markets activity returning. and i think in typical goldman fashion, you all have been i think, appropriately conservative over the last couple of quarters. so maybe i'll just get a mark-to-market on what green shoots you may or may not be seeing. you mentioned your advisory pipeline was up, just kind of contextualize that, that would be great.",2,2023
4,0,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. i'd say the following. it deﬁnitely feels better over the course of the last 6 to 8 weeks than it felt earlier in the year . and i've talked in the past on this call and other times when i've talked to many of you about the fact that when you have a big reset, it takes 5 or 6 quarters to get that reset. it's not surprising that we're kind of at 6 quarters now and you're starting to see more activity . so it's deﬁnitely been a pickup in equity capital markets activity . that deﬁnitely feels better . there's more m&a dialogue i can't tell you exactly what the journey is. but when i go back and i look historically at other periods where the macro environment has created sharp drops in investment banking activity , they tend to last for a year or so and then they start to improve. and so i think we're starting to see that here. it deﬁnitely feels better . i think the inﬂation data has been better . the client sentiment is better and now we'll have to watch and see that journey . but i know this activity level of 10-year lows in investment banking activity is not going to be the norm on a forward basis.",2,2023
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," i guess maybe just the ﬁrst question, when we think about potential for obviously pick up in the back half, david, as you just mentioned but give us a sense of rightsizing the business, given the slowdown that we've seen over the last year or so, -- are we there headcount-wise, infrastructure-wise, where you want it to be on the expense base and as we anchor back to the efﬁciency target around 60%. just give us a sense of how you think we get there and where the where goldman is today in terms of just rightsizing the expense base?",2,2023
1,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. so i think we've made -- i'll make a couple of comments and denis will probably add on with some more granular detail. but i think we've made progress. w e set out some targets at the beginning of the year . as you heard in denis' prepared remarks, we have them basically accomplished and in line of sight for more. you've seen our noncomp expense ex these extraordinary items around impairments have been down for the second quarter in a row . we've been very focused on that. and there's been real work done there because there's certainly inﬂationary pressure on a bunch of the line items that are noncomp expenses. i think that with hindsight, i'm very glad that we were early in january is starting to work on the headcount sizing. w e took a couple of actions so far this year and we feel good about where we are. i'd remind everybody . and we've said this before that we are resuming our regular performance- based process that we do with compensation at the end of the year which we had stopped during the pandemic and started again next year when we go through compensation, we will do a performance review but we have no other speciﬁc plans on the headcount now . we'll watch the trajectory of revenues in the environment as we go forward. we'll always make adjustments if something changes. but as we just said, we think we're operating an extraordinarily low activities of investment banking. w e're not going to erode that franchise. that is a key franchise of the ﬁrm. so this is a moment that we probably have to support that a little bit more as things recover . we obviously are focused on a bunch of efﬁciency uplift in processes and operations. w e have a big project going on to make some investments that can create more automation and technology and we feel good about that. so we think that over time, that's not a 2023 or early '24 thing but we think over time, that's something else that will beneﬁt the trajectory . denis, do you have some speciﬁcs to add?",2,2023
2,1,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," i mean just to add for you. so end of the second quarter , we ended -- headcount was 44,600 it’ s down about 2% on the quarter , about 8% year-to-date. i think the more comparable metric is probably the year-over-year metric of down 5% because we'll have new joiners in the third quarter . but as david said, we're happy about taking the action early in the year , positioning the ﬁrm appropriately and also pleased that we’ve been able to reach towards our target of $600 million in run rate payroll efﬁciencies.",2,2023
3,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," got it. and just maybe a quick follow-up. i think if i heard you correctly , you mentioned goal to maybe step up a pace of buybacks in the back half. just if you could maybe put some numbers around that, what level of buybacks we should expect? and how big a deal is the fed basel npr, from what we're hearing, it may take 6, 12 months before we know what the ﬁnal rules when they incorporate industry feedback look like? so how big of an unknown that is in terms of your capital deployment plans?",2,2023
4,1,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so you have pieces of the answer to my question to the question for my answer . so what we would say , obviously , very pleased with the ccar results -- we have 190 basis points of cushion. w e intend to deploy some of that excess capital into the client franchise to continue to grow our activities there. w e announced our increase in dividend. w e've been very committed to sustainably growing our dividend and we're going to increase our level of buybacks. w e are mindful of basel iii revisions but we also recognize that we will get a rule. there will be a comment period for the rule. there will be a period in which that's implemented, some suggestions in the beginning of 2026. that implementation may even have a phase- in period. so as we think about the way in which we manage capital we think we should be optimizing for our client franchise and for our shareholders. we obviously will make sure we're in a position to adopt any new guidance and to do so on time and early -- but in the intervening period, we're going to continue to manage our capital to grow the ﬁrm and to deliver returns of capital to shareholders and we thought we would indicate that, that intention is to step it up from where we are.",2,2023
0,2,Steven Chubak,question,question," david, there's been a fair amount of price speculation covering how you’re -- the consumer business, speciﬁcally even some recently suggesting you might look to sell some additional receivables tied to partnership with apple and gm. i know price speculation might not be representative of what's actually being discussed. so it might be helpful just to hear about your strategic priorities for the consumer business, maybe how your vision has evolved in recent months just given some of the challenges facing that business and maybe not ﬁtting with your -- aligning with your core competencies.",2,2023
1,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. so thanks for the question. and i frame it this way . as i think you know , we made difﬁcult but appropriate decision over a year ago, working with our board to narrow our consumer ambitions and kind of rolled out the fall, the direction of travel and have been executing on that. and that included the wind down and the execution of the markets the wind down of the execution of the sale of the marcus loan portfolio which has now been completed and obviously exploring options for greensky which we've been transparent on are in the process of. w e've also said very clearly that our credit card partnerships are long-term partnerships. w e don't have unilateral rights with them. they deﬁnitely can operate better . we've been working hard to improve the operation of them which will reduce the drag and we're making good progress on that. and we're working with apple and also with gm to do that. and so there's a signiﬁcant focus on reducing that drag. and the drag of those credit card partnerships has gotten smaller and it will continue to be reduced as we move forward into 2024. we continue to have a very strong deposit platform. w e launched an apple savings platform which also was a successful launch to grow our deposit base. and so we'll continue to grow deposits and that's the course that we're on at the moment.",2,2023
2,2,Steven Chubak,question,question," it's great color . maybe just for my follow-up on equity ﬁnancing speciﬁcally . the contribution in the ﬁrst half actually implies an incremental $1 billion in fees year-on- year. you've deﬁnitely been highlighting the commitment to grow the ﬁnancing piece. and just wanted to better understand, one, the durability of the gains that you saw in the ﬁrst half and as we look out over the next few years, how signiﬁcant of a contribution to the trading business do you expect from the ﬁnancing component both across equities as well as fic?",2,2023
3,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," so i'm going to start with a high-level just strategic view of what i think we've done and we're focused on doing and then denis will give you a little bit more detail. but 1 of the things -- this has been a strategic priority for us because i certainly remember going back over the last decade, there were times where we did not have the largest equity business and we were not in a position with our clients and the equity franchise that we're in now . and there were some reasons based on strategic decisions that we made at the time. but we've been very focused over the last decade in improving that position and have made good progress and growing the ﬁnancing franchise and also expanding the base of clients that we worked with there has made a real dif ference. and so, i look at the equities performance this quarter and feel very good about it; very good about what the team has accomplished and very good about the feedback we get from clients. now broadly , that ﬁnancing revenue is more durable than intermediation revenue but it obviously is af fected by risk on, risk of f and overall market level activities. and so there can be variability in it but there's a base stability there that's much more meaningful than intermediation revenues. denis can expand a little bit more on how we think about that from a risk and a capital perspective.",2,2023
4,2,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so that is the strategic direction of travel. w e are allocating a lot of time and resources, human capital, ﬁnancial capital to grow those activities equities ﬁnancing revenues are nearly 50% of overall equities revenue this quarter and that's something that has been growing. even the combined fic and equities ﬁnancing as a percentage of pick and equities continue to grow . so remain very focused on prioritizing activities in that space with clients. and we're also observing that there's a virtuous reinforcement of our commitments to grow market share and to cover clients more holistically over a multiyear period. it's paying dividends both across dividend and intermediation and recognizing david's comments with respect to market valuation levels which drive changes in balances and changes in behavior , there's also activities that we've been taking to sort of systematically identify components of the client base across the ﬁnancing activities and make sure that we're capturing more share in underpenetrated portions of the client base. so remain committed to growing that activity . it's relatively more durable than intermediation but like other line items, it can ﬂuctuate on the forward.",2,2023
0,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question," just one follow-up to that last question and then a dif ferent one. but just on the last question. so you mentioned durability when you were talking about ﬁnancing, that was part of what i wanted to understand. do you feel like this quarter of ﬁnancing revenue is a good jump of f point for us to grow from. and if there's any puts and takes on how you would think -- how would you want us to think about that level of durability , that would be helpful.",2,2023
1,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so i'll comment both on ficc and equities. in ﬁxed income, we had slightly softer performance over period-on-period. that was driven by a component of ﬁxed ﬁnancing which is more episodic which is commodities-based ﬁnancing, those activity levels were a lot higher . and so i think you see lack of contribution from commodities-based ﬁnancing activity that was in prior periods but i think the forward for other components of our ﬁxed ﬁnancing, like collateralized lending and repo, i think there remains opportunity for us to deploy and continue to grow those types of activities. i'm always cautious about predicting growth of f of record performance. we're pleased with the equities ﬁnancing performance in the second quarter and we do intend to grow that from here but we'll have to continue to work hard to continue to deliver the type of period-over-period growth but we do think there is still unaddressed market share and we continue to grow our balances to grow those revenues.",2,2023
2,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question," and you highlighted capital obviously have excess, signiﬁcant excess. so there's that ﬂex between buybacks versus deploy . this is an opportunity to deploy . i guess the follow-up i had to that was in your comments earlier on the basel iii end game. i think you mentioned that you -- look, you're in a position to be opportunistic, whether or not you want to meet the requirements early . and i guess that was the question i had on when you say on time, of course but early just meaning within that phase-in period early . and again, i kind of asked the question with the context of you've got this opportunity in ﬁnancing. so how should i think through meeting it early versus leaning into ﬁnancing versus other options you might have.",2,2023
3,3,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes, betsy . so look, i appreciate that. i think there's a lot that's unknown about the direction of travel on this. and we're talking about years out. and so i think denis' message on early was in the context of the phase-in period, making sure we were getting there on time. but no, we are focused on deploying -- we generate a lot of capital because the ﬁrm generally through the cycle generates good earnings. w e are going to return a bunch of that to shareholders and there are opportunities as we're talking about to deploy that in service of plants. given the work we've done strategically , we now have much greater ﬂexibility which gives us the option to look sharply as some of the deployment opportunities where maybe 6 to 12 months ago, we felt we needed to be more cautious. and at the same point, we have more capacity , as denis said, to step up buybacks. you should view that we're very , very focused on delivering capital to serve clients and to shareholders and we'll be very thoughtful about the adjustment phase in of whatever comes when we understand it. but i'd just say there's a lot of uncertainty . it's a ways out; there's going to be comment periods. and so there's nothing going to be premature about what we do.",2,2023
0,4,Mike Mayo,question,question," look, i think you described here the rightsizing with investment equity debt cie, the consumer and with head count is what were any [indiscernible] and where are you on the rightsizing of headcount? and the big picture question for david is simply , is this as bad as it gets? do you feel comfortable that you captured everything with any severance to marches to greensky to cie with debt investment -- debt equity investment and that you were conservative enough? are we going to keep seeing 9% roes or does this accelerate your journey to that 15% midterm roe?",2,2023
1,4,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," okay . mike, it's denis. i'll start and then i'll turn it over to david. so we called out our severance expense year-to-date was $260 million the vast majority of that was in the ﬁrst quarter in connection with much, much larger levels of headcount reductions then. the reason that we're making an ef fort to call it out, you will also notice that our comp ratio net of business at 34%. w e're just making an ef fort to provide transparency in terms of what components of our compensation expense accruals are designed for severance. and we think that's important because with the balance - - we're going to be focused on our pay-for-performance ethos as well as balancing returns for shareholders but making sure that we have the capacity this year to protect our talent, protect the franchise, make sure we're positioned to capture the upside. so, the severance disclosures are just designed to help understand the ﬁnancial impact of the actions we've taken david will give you more color but we've largely done what we set out to do. w e're on target for the payroll efﬁciencies and that i'll help you understand what the severance picture is relative to the overall accrued level of compensation and expense.",2,2023
2,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," and mike, to your bigger question, this was a meaningful quarter of putting some things that we strategically decided to do behind us. with respect to the balance sheet, i think one of the things that's very important to call out, this is an environment at the moment that's been hard on that legacy balance sheet. w e are reducing the legacy balance sheet but we could just as well next quarter , if the environment improves, of positive revenues from that legacy balance sheet too. but if the environment got worse, we still have balance sheet to reduce. so i've been around the ﬁrm a long time. this was obviously a tough quarter but we also had one-of f items that we put in. w e're going to continue to give you transparency on the legacy balance sheet and we're going to continue to move forward. i think the environment feels better , if the environment feels better and the environment turns out to be better , you'll see better performance. but i feel very , very good about the strategic decisions that we're making, the execution that we're working on, the progress we're making in asset and wealth management and we as a leadership team see a clear path to improvement in a better operating environment.",2,2023
3,4,Mike Mayo,question,question, and can you remind us -- so you're taking this pain the charges and you're looking to get to mid-teens roe in the medium term. how do you deﬁne medium term? and what should we be looking at along the way because to the extent that this accelerates this transition. it'd be nice to see some metrics externally for that progress?,2,2023
4,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, we're going to make progress, mike, over the next couple of years, the next 2 to 3 years, we're going to make meaningful progress. but i'd just highlight, when you go back to our core business, banking and markets, where we are a leader and i think given the mix of that business is performing well and what's not a perfect environment for that business, if that business, we really believe will deliver mid- teens through the cycle. the investment banking returns right now are at a very , very signiﬁcant low but we do have a 14% roe to date in global banking and markets. so an improved environment should help us. the asset management journey is going to take and we were very clear about this in february , it's going to take 2 to 3 more years for us to continue to make progress on the journey with respect to the continued reduction of the balance sheet and the revenue growth and the margin uplift. and we're working on it. w e see a clear line of sight and we're going to make progress.",2,2023
0,5,Brennan Hawken,question,question," you spoke earlier to green shoots that you're seeing in the banking side given how important sponsors are to your banking franchise, curious to drill down and speciﬁcally understand what you're seeing with that cohort and whether or not we need to see the levered loan market recover before they can come back in full force?",2,2023
1,5,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. so thanks for that question, brennan. it's a good question. it's an important thing. i'm glad you're asking us to highlight it because i think about it this way and it's very, very important. when you look at our m&a  business, a signiﬁcant contributor to our m&a  business is m&a  responses and that's come to a halt. it's come to a halt. there are 2 aspects of it. there's buy side and the sell side. the buy side obviously also give us ﬁnancing and other capital markets activity . the sell side sometimes gives staple and ﬁnancing opportunity , too but that stuf f has kind of come to a hall. here's one thing i know about ﬁnancial sponsors. number one, they own a bunch of assets. they're all for sale and they all will be sold. this environment has slowed down the pace of sale in a better environment that will accelerate. and i think we're going to see that accelerate as we look forward from here. this has been a particularly slow environment for that. secondly , they have enormous dry powder , okay? and they can't make money unless they deploy . and so as soon as you get to a place, the values reset and ﬁnancing costs are understood, you start to see people deploy . we're starting to see some of that. you saw this quarter , obviously , a very , very big transaction around fis. and so you're going, i think [indiscernible] as we move forward. so this is a very , very important part of the investment banking ecosystem that kind of came to a shutdown given the volatility of change in the environment. and i'm not smart enough to tell you this quarter , next quarter but it will meaningfully improve and it's an important component to investment banking activity . and it's one of the reasons why investment in banking activity is running at kind of from an activity level, kind of 10-year lows. and the other part of your question, brennan, speaks to availability and health of ﬁnancing markets. i think we certainly have underwriting appetite to facilitate these transactions. w e believe we can distribute risk into the market. there's also a number of principal in buckets, both with our clients and within our own funds that are capable of deploying ﬁnancing to support transaction activity in this environment that could also be an attractive source of activity for the ﬁrm.",2,2023
2,5,Brennan Hawken,question,question," great, i appreciate it. and then for my second, you started the process of selling greensky . we saw the goodwill impairment. what's been the reception to that asset? and has that impacted your expectation for how quickly you could ﬁnalize that sale?",2,2023
3,5,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," brennan, in terms of the process, we're obviously in the middle of the process. w e have feedback. i think extra color , just to share with you in terms of how you think about potential on the forward. it's a business we bought for $1.7 billion. w e integrated into goldman sachs. w e're seeing it perform well. it's a good business. we had made the decision to explore alternatives because it's not the right ﬁt necessarily for goldman sachs. w e've written down the goodwill in the consumer platform segment. there's no more goodwill to be written down. that business at this point has remaining unamortized intangibles approximately $625 million that we consider for impairment on a quarterly basis and we'll do so in the future. and should we move forward with the transaction with respect to greensky , it could happen in a number of dif ferent ways. w e could sell the platform, we could sell the platform and the historical lending book that we have on balance sheet. and should we choose to sell the loan book, we'll designate that as held for sale, much like the marcus loans process and you'll see the p&l  impact accordingly as we mark the loans and release the associated reserve. so those are the types of things that could occur on the forward given the strategic activity but i don't think there's anything else to say about the greensky process given where we are.",2,2023
0,6,Devin Ryan,question,question," in markets we hit on ﬁnancing. so i just want to look at intermediation here. and obviously , results were of f quite a bit from a great quarter last year . but based on the results, it also looks like you did better than the implication on the conference circuit late in the quarter . so just the implication there would be that june got a lot better for intermediation. so i just want to make sure kind of that read is correct. and then did june feel like a more normal month relative to the ﬁrst couple? and has that continued? just trying to think about the quarter and the cadence there?",2,2023
1,6,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. so thanks, kevin. i'd just say and you highlighted this appropriately , just pointing back. i mean, one of the big dif ferences when you look at the year-over-year comparison is we're coming out of the period where the word started in russia and there was an enormous activity in the commodity space. and we were very , very well positioned to serve clients in that space. and so we -- if you go back and you look at the second quarter 2022, we way outperformed in that quarter because of that commodities activity and obviously didn't have that here. i think to the second part of your comment, yes, june was better . june was deﬁnitely better . and so there was an improvement in tone and a little bit of improvement in risk on and what we're early in the quarter . but there's no question, there's more of a risk on sentiment in the month of july than it was earlier in the second quarter . and you just think about it, we're coming out of march, we were coming out of the banking crisis and you think about when we were on this call in early april, we're in a very dif ferent place in terms of investor sentiment overall. so there has been an improvement through the quarter . and i think it's noted appropriately .",2,2023
2,6,Devin Ryan,question,question," okay , that's great. and then just on transaction banking and the momentum there, be great to just get an update on some of the kind of the drivers. and really , the question is, it's such a huge market as you guys identiﬁed when you got the business. it's still a very small driver for goldman. and so just trying to think about the growth there? and are there opportunities for more step function growth if you add a certain capability? or just how should we think about the opportunity to really -- this to become a much bigger business for goldman?",2,2023
3,6,David Solomon,answer,answer," so i appreciate that question. i think it's -- i think you're right. i think we've got an interesting platform. it's been very constructive in bringing deposits to goldman sachs. but one of the things that we said over the last couple of quarters is we're working now on getting the clients that are on the platform to really get more of their payments activity into the ﬂow , so this delivers real revenue and real value over time, that's taking some time and it will take some time. i think it's a dispersed business where there are lots of providers for most people. these are our clients, so we have the right to kind of compete for and be engaged for this. they like our technology but making changes in payment ﬂows takes time. so i think the team here is very focused on the long-term investment in building those relationships. i think a particular opportunity for us is around what i call kind of ﬁnancial sponsor companies, etcetera. w e're obviously given our ﬁnancial sponsors franchise. w e have a very , very good opportunity set over time. but this is going to take time to execute. i think it's one of those things where we have a business that's performing ﬁne but it's not making a meaningful contribution. but i think this is something where, over time, we'll work hard to ﬁgure out how this can make a more meaningful contribution to the ﬁrm with our client base.",2,2023
0,7,Daniel Fannon,question,question," i wanted to ask about private banking and lending, even ex the $100 million gain this quarter . that continues to be an area of growth. can you talk about the prospects as we think about going forward and the inputs to kind of continue the lower growth you've seen?",2,2023
1,7,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. so it's highlighted as one of those areas within the overall asset & w ealth management business which we think has the combined beneﬁt of growth opportunities as well as more stable and recurring revenues, there's a couple of components inside of that line item. w e've obviously seen strong growth in the deposit platform which has been contributing nicely and that was the area in which we had our marcus loans activities which on the for those will obviously have -- will not be contributing on the forward. but the other piece of it which is an area of strategic priority for us is the overall activities with respect to wealth lending activities. and we have, as i think david highlighted earlier , premium ultra-high net worth business that has been growing nicely . but we feel like we're relatively underpenetrated with respect to some of the lending activities with those clients and across the wealth space. and so we have some new leadership across the division in the past number of quarters and a very , very clear mandate that we should be out there aggressively leaning into those relationships and making sure that we can solidify them as comprehensively as possible and we expect that will be a contributor to that line item as well on the forward.",2,2023
2,7,Daniel Fannon,question,question," great. and then just as a follow-up, in terms of the balance sheet reduction outlook and as you think about line of sight which i think you used to give us some numbers and given capital markets may be opening up and a little bit more receptive to exit anything that you could point to or numerically talk about in the short term that you're planning on or have as i said, line of sight on?",2,2023
3,7,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. i appreciate that question. so obviously , we took you to current on historical principal investments at 23.8%. you know that there is a year-end '24 target of below $15 billion. w e said we are well on pace towards that target. i would say that we have line of sight on several billion of incremental reductions. w e have a large number of processes and positions that we're exploring for disposition. they're all in various stages of completeness from exclusivity to on of fer to being marketed to being prepared. w e've moved a large number of positions year-to-date and we have more that we're focused on moving from here. so i would of fer that up as it's an ongoing highly engaged process where we expect to make incremental progress.",2,2023
0,8,Matt O'Connor,question,question," so the scb obviously came down very nicely this year and has been trending down for a couple of years now . we are getting some questions on how some of the consumer loan portfolios have impacted that. and speciﬁcally with the sale of the marcus loans and potentially sale of greensky loans and again, according to the media, potentially exit the credit card. i guess the question is, do those loans actually help bring down the scb? or what are the puts and takes there as you think about the impact of those loan portfolios in aggregate on the annual f aca.",2,2023
1,8,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. so look, you're familiar with the process as we are. there's various levels of transparency that you get through the process. obviously , those contributions from lending activities which roll into components of the test. but the big driver for us and what we feel has been enabling us to meaningfully move down our scb towards the 5% area that we've been discussing is really attributable to the on-balance sheet investments. w e think that has a very , very meaningful impact for us. and the thing i would remind you is that the impact that was just revealed in this year's test with this scb of 5.5% due to be implemented in october , that's based on the snapshot of activity that the fed took last year which means that all the activities that we're discussing on this call are going to be considered in the next test. and assuming that the test is similar next year to the test this year which i don't know . but if it is, we will continue to see beneﬁt from our reduction of these on balance sheet investments. so the reason why we remain so focused on setting those targets and providing so much transparency about our trajectory and our path is that we really believe that, that's a very , very meaningful way to understand our trajectory in terms of minimum capital ratios until, obviously , any new news on that front.",2,2023
2,8,Matt O'Connor,question,question, okay . so focus much more on the legacy on balance sheet positions versus the consumer lending portfolios?,2,2023
3,8,David Solomon,answer,answer, yes.,2,2023
0,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," david, in your opening comments, you were talking about you guys are still very focused on reaching a mid-teens roe through the cycle. w e all know the business has been depressed as you pointed out in your comments. can you share with us, if you go -- we have -- the public has access to the geologic data your data is probably better than that. but if you look at the geologic data for '21 and '22, obviously , global investment banking revenues were unusually strong. why would you think is a normal level for global investment banking revenues that you need to get to that mid- teens roe that you're targeting?",2,2023
1,9,David Solomon,answer,answer," so again, i'd highlight that global banking and markets, even in this environment, has close to 14% roe for the ﬁrst 6 months of the year in what's not a great environment for investment banking. w e don't disclose the separate roe for investment banking but i just highlight to you, it's running way , way below what it's run on average over the course of the last 5 in the last 10 years. w e do not have to go back to 2021 kind of levels in order to see a material uplift in that investment banking roe which would bolster the overall through-the-cycle uplift of our global banking and markets franchise. i'm sure in my lifetime, maybe not my career , i'll see another year like 2021 but 2021 falls into that category of years that come along once in a decade, i wouldn't call that normal either . but i would say that this is not normal and normalize somewhere in between. our average, i hate the word normal, average lies somewhere in between.",2,2023
2,9,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," the only thing i would add which i'm sure is intuited to, gerard, some of the activities that are not contributing us substantially right now are very capital-efﬁcient activities. and so looking at deal logic levels of activity or revenues are 1 metric but some of them are very , very beneﬁcial to our overall results. and they also have the capacity to catalyze other activities as a consequence. so in environments of more active levels of investment banking, we see some positive impact across the rest of the ﬁrm that's not necessarily captured simply from the delta explained in that investment banking line.",2,2023
3,9,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. one other thing, gerard, i'd just add, if you go back, it's an interesting thing to do. if you go back and you look at investment banking revenues from people who report them, over the last 20-plus years, go back to 2000 and look at investment banking revenues. there's a change in the environment and investment banking revenues have dropped meaningfully because of that. you can go back and you can see that at other times over the last 20 to 25 years. you can see that from 2001 to 2002. you can see that from 2007 to 2008. you can see that in 2010 to 201 1. and obviously , you're seeing it from 2021 to 2022 and '23. what's interesting is to go look at what happens when you come out of the cycle and kind of look at the growth in the upshot because market cap grows, there's growth in the economy , etcetera, i don't think it's going to be dif ferent this time. i think this is a cycle. w e haven't seen a cycle in a while. and the other side of the cycle will continue to look attractive the services of advising the need for mergers and consolidation, even though there can be headwinds and friction, the need for capital markets activity , ipos, equity ﬁnancing, destiny , that's a fundamental part of our economy . it's not going away . it's been depressed for the last 4 to 6 quarters.",2,2023
4,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," very helpful. and then denis, a technical question for you on greensky . you mentioned that you still have intangibles and you are going to think -- or you still have a determination to make whether greensky should move into held for sale. two-part question. what will trigger that to move it into held for sale? then should you do that? and if there's an intangible impairment, do you have to take that impairment at that time when you move it into held for sale or you can wait for a later date?",2,2023
5,9,David Solomon,answer,answer," so, thank you. the decision as to whether and when we move it to held for sale is when we make a decision afﬁrmatively that we are selling the business and we're selling the loan portfolio and we will. when we make that decision, we will designate it as such and you will see the p&l  consequences of that designation at that point in time. w e evaluate the intangibles every single quarter for impairment. and in the next quarter , we will also analyze the intangibles for impairment.",2,2023
0,10,James Mitchell,question,question," just on platform solutions proﬁtability . i appreciate you getting to an efﬁciency ratio already below 100%. but the other drag on proﬁts is credit. i think you guys noted that in consumer platforms had a 5.8% net charge-of f ratio. i would imagine point of sale is lower than cards. so that would imply cards as well north of 6% in terms of that charge-of f ratio. how do we -- is that right? and how do we think about the credit quality in that book and where you see it kind of normalizing? sp1 sure. so a couple of things. on the one hand, the net charge-of f in consumer at 5 for the quarter , given the nature of our portfolio, its maturity , the overall operating environment we do expect that, that will continue to tick up over the next couple of quarters.",2,2023
1,10,Carey Halio,answer,answer," but you'll also notice that we reduced our coverage ratio this quarter as well. and that's because the performance of the activities is actually coming in better than we had originally expected. w e had put together provisions on a conservative basis. and now as we have more and more data coming through, we actually are comfortable in removing some of that conservatism and bringing down the coverage ratio. so i'd say trending as expected with overall better data coming through than originally anticipated.",2,2023
2,10,James Mitchell,question,question, okay . maybe just a follow-up question on w ealth management. i haven't really talked about it in a while but whether it's with aeco and trying to move a little bit down market from the ultra-high net port space. can you talk to the progress you've made there? and what kind of where you're seeing investments in growth?,2,2023
3,10,David Solomon,answer,answer," so aeco, within the overall platform, aco is something we continue to grow . we continue to be focused on. it's extremely well received, in particular , by a number of our c-suite clients. it's part of our approach to having a more integrated and comprehensive approach to clients in that segment. w e do see opportunities to continue to expand our of fering. w e also see opportunities to expand within the ultra- high net worth space, both in the united states and abroad and we have a very , very long track record of delivering and we believe we are actually despite the franchise under-penetrated and continue to grow that as well.",2,2023
0,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," hi. thanks very much. so, i appreciate the $1 billion harvesting out of the balance sheet pe and the other $1 billion coming up. so, it's a partial answer to the question. but in the backdrop that we've seen with slowing m&a  in almost no ipos. my original question was going to be, can you still get to that scb of 5% that's so important to give us all conﬁdence about putting up that 15% to 17% return over time? how do you view that forward look of the march towards 5%?",1,2022
1,0,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so glenn, it's denis. thank you. thank you for the question. obviously , our results in the quarter in terms of rote of 15.8% and roe was 15%. our medium-term targets that you referenced were to be achieved by 2024. so we're really pleased with the performance in this quarter . as it relates to scb, for us, it continues to be making the choices that we can with respect to investing in our business mix, creating more durable and predictable revenue streams, and then also continuing to migrate down our on-balance sheet equity position. so i think our commitment to the strategy remains intact. w e have, obviously , submitted our ccar submission, and we await response from the federal reserve. and we will continue to focus on driving those aspects of our business that we can, all of which we hope will contribute to an scb that is lower and reﬂects our business mix.",1,2022
2,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," okay . i appreciate that it's working so far good ﬁrst quarter . maybe a little follow-up on the sponsor side. and it's both as you as someone that's planning to raise a lot of third-party money as an alternative manager and also you as the largest servicer of that sponsor community , can you give a little insight towards just what's going on? do you expect -- is the capital raising environment disrupted. you harvested $1 billion, but can you still have a decent harvesting backdrop amidst the disruptive banking backdrop? thanks so much.",1,2022
3,0,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure, glenn, it's david. and i'll jump in here. i would say that there are a variety of secular tailwinds that are still driving lots of institutional capital on a global basis towards broad alternatives platforms. i think despite the volatility that exists in markets, those trends continue to be in place. and i think you'll continue to see secular growth in the amount of capital, institutional capital that's allocated to alternatives platforms for quite some time. in the context of that, i think we and others do have big broad multi-product, global platforms that are well-positioned. and so while the pace of fundraising might ebb and ﬂow a little bit from peaks, i think the general secular trend is still in place in this volatility . i don't think in the short run will af fect that. with respect to monetizations and values, there is no question that we've gone through a period of time where the macro backdrop certainly created an acceleration of that. there were a variety of factors that i think were more short-term than ampliﬁed that. and i think we've commented in the past about the fact that we did not think that was levels of activity were sustainable. however , even in an environment like this, when you have a broad diversiﬁed portfolio of assets, and there are certainly lots of areas where there's real growth in the economy , and the economy is still growing very well, the opportunity to see monetizations, to see transactions, i think, continues just probably not at the same pace and velocity as we saw in 2020 and 2021.",1,2022
0,1,Christian Bolu,question,question," good morning. so overall rote of 16% was pretty impressive in the quarter , given it was a pretty challenging backdrop. are you now in a place where you think, given the diversity of the business model that goldman should pretty much always earn cost of capital on a quarterly basis?",1,2022
1,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, i mean, i -- always is a deﬁnitive word. w e never say always to anything because there certainly could be environments that we do not foresee that could produce the distribution of outcomes, a very skewed outcome in one direction or the other . i do think that this leadership team over the last almost four years has made signiﬁcant investments in our business and that has allowed us to grow our business, and that has allowed us to better plan in our business given some of the investments and planning process we made that hopefully , over time, will give the market more conﬁdence in the durability of these returns. i think we're well-positioned. in february , we laid out these medium-term targets. w e do not lay out targets lightly . so i would never comment on what could happen in any given quarter , christian, but i think we have a larger more durable business, and i think we're going to continue to add to that durability as we move forward, and we're very committed to executing on that strategy .",1,2022
2,1,Christian Bolu,question,question," okay . thanks. on ficc, just maybe more broadly , intermediation businesses. how do you think about the potential going forward as the fed sort of shrink its balance sheet and raises rates, trying to ﬁgure out the potential for meaningfully good volatility and greater demand for risk intermediation services versus any sort of funding cost headwinds that may occur?",1,2022
3,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," so i mean, i comment from a macro perspective on a couple of things with respect to that. and i'm not smart enough to know what good volatility or bad volatility is. w e're more focused on serving our clients and ensuring that we have the highest market share available with those clients as they position their portfolios that they transact. intermediation is a big business. i think it's always going to be a big business. that doesn't mean that it can't ebb and ﬂow from quarter-to-quarter . but i think that one way to frame this is that the size of the available intermediation activity that's out there for ﬁrms like ourselves that play a big role in this is bigger today than it was ﬁve years ago, going back pre-pandemic. and in addition, based on investments we've made both in the client centricity and the approach we're taking and in technology , our market shares are larger , and we think those market share gains are durable. i'd also highlight that we've been -- and we've been very clear with you on this, building our ﬁnancing capability for those clients and one of the things about that business now is a larger proportion of it is ﬁnancing revenue and that ﬁnancing revenue is more durable. so i feel good about the way the business is positioned. i won't speculate on what every quarter will look like going forward. but certainly , i think, we're better positioned in this business today than we were ﬁve years ago. and i think that's reﬂected, for example, in a quarter like this and the results of the client activity we're able to accomplish.",1,2022
0,2,Steven Chubak,question,question," hi. good morning. so wanted to start of f with a question on capital management. you guys were clear positive outliers in the quarter . many of your peers reported pretty signiﬁcant drawdowns in cet1. admittedly , i was a bit surprised to see the improvement in your ratios, just given a lot of the sources of r wa inﬂation that have been cited on some of the other calls have really highlighted market risk r wa inﬂation. i was hoping you can just give some perspective on how much of an impact did you see from higher market risk r was in the quarter , where you could see some relief down the road? and just given the accretion in capital you saw in the quarter , whether there's any appetite to accelerate buybacks, especially into a declining share price?",1,2022
1,2,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure, steven. thank you for the question. as it relates to our build of capital over the course of the quarter , that was deliberate. w e knew that at the beginning of the second quarter that we would have to pay for the nnip  acquisition. and so we had -- we've grown our capital over the course of the ﬁrst quarter . we also were very disciplined on r wa growth. our growth was $5 billion on a quarter-over-quarter basis. so we were able to deliver types of results that david just made reference to across our big businesses while maintaining a discipline with respect to r wa growth so that also contributed to the improvement. now as it relates to our outlook, we've been reasonably clear that our ﬁrst priority in terms of driving long-term results for shareholders and supporting clients is to deploy capital into accretive client opportunities. and once again, you would see in the ﬁrst quarter with the global markets segment roe north of 25% and ﬁrm line roe at 15%, there certainly were attractive client deployment opportunities, and we prioritized that. we remain focused on sustainably growing a dividend. and then obviously , to the extent the opportunities to support clients or the market environment shifts, obviously , we'd look to return that capital back to shareholders. i would say from where i sit right now , looking at the second quarter , my expectation on buybacks is to be reasonably consistent with the ﬁrst quarter , but we do expect to remain nimble. and to the extent that the opportunity set with clients is less attractive and you make reference to the then prevailing share price, that's obviously something that we'll consider .",1,2022
2,2,Steven Chubak,question,question," that's great color , denis. and just for my follow-up on the investment banking businesses. you noted the backlogs are stable year-on-year , certainly a good outcome given the macro uncertainty . but i was hoping you could just provide a little bit more granularity on the individual investment banking businesses and more speciﬁcally , how you expect them to perform over the next, call it, six to 12 months? and how much of the slowdown that we've ﬁrst quarter would you attribute to growing macro risks and waning ceo conﬁdence that could drive a more prolonged slowdown versus maybe something that's more temporary due to the elevated market volatility?",1,2022
3,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," so i'll start, steve, and just say that, that activity level is still quite high and engagement from our banking clients is still quite high. there's no question that equity beta kind of turned of f for the quarter . and so one of the things that happened was a bunch of equity issuance that was supposed to happen in the quarter got pushed out. that deﬁnitely is a market volatility ef fect. and my guess is as the market volatility settles down during the course of the year to the degree that it does, that will bring some of that issuance back into the marketplace. w e've seen when you look over the course of the last 20 years, plenty of periods of time where there are quarters where you have very , very low equity issuance, it's been very rare that, that continues for a year or a longer period and that doesn't mean that, that couldn't happen, but certainly that would be expected given the history . as businesses need capital, they need to make investments at a time as prices reset or values reset, people need some time to absorb those changes versus their expectations. but ultimately , at the end of the day , they understand the reality and they move forward. i don't see a signiﬁcant change in kind of strategic dialogue. i would say if the world got materially worse and materially more volatile given some of the geopolitical stuf f that was going on, that certainly would have the potential to slow down some of the strategic activity and dialogue, but at the moment that activity level and certainly the engagement remains quite good, quite robust. but we watch it very , very closely . i would note that i think it's important to just recognize and we said this at the year- end, at year-end on the year-end call that the activity levels that we saw in 2021 in the banking business, nobody expected those to be normalized levels. so i'd certainly describe a little bit of what we're seeing as a normalization. and i think ﬁrst quarter overall activity , there's some normalization of that, although, i think equity is well below what i would call a normalized trend.",1,2022
0,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question, hi. good morning.,1,2022
1,3,David Solomon,answer,answer, good morning.,1,2022
2,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question," i know we've talked a lot about the investment banking side of the business. maybe we could turn to the loan growth areas that you're focused on. and just want to understand what you're expecting there from some of the recent acquisitions like greensky , some of the new relationships that you've got, i know it's been a couple of years already , but apple card is growing nicely from the gm relationship. how should we think about the capital call that that piece of the business will have? and what kind of growth rate you expect to get this year? thanks.",1,2022
3,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," hi, betsy . thank you very much for the question. look, we've been very focused on growing these businesses and whether it be loan growth across the consumer platform in terms of installment loan business or the cards businesses or now with the acquisition of greensky , or whether it be across private wealth channels or even across our ficc ﬁnancing businesses, we have a strategic objective to continue to grow those businesses in a credit sensitive fashion. and in terms of thinking about the impact and how to think about that through the p&l, you'll see that in the ﬁrst quarter , we did raise our provisions for credit losses. they were at 561 versus 344 and a primary driver of that was our growth in loan activity . so that's something that we expect across these businesses as we grow them. w e expect as we grow the portfolio of greensky that will also continue to provision. so it remains focused for the ﬁrm. w e're looking at across multiple channels and trying to keep in mind sort of underwriting credit quality as we do so.",1,2022
4,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question," yes. and that's kind of the follow-up i had, because we've got the forward curve looking for something like nine rate hikes this year , a few more next year . and so there's a triangulation between rate hikes and credit quality . and how are you thinking about that? when you talk about the provision increase you've done, maybe you could unpack that a little bit as to how much of that was coming from loan volume increase expected versus what you're anticipating for credit quality changes, given that backdrop i just mentioned?",1,2022
5,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. fair enough. and that's a question we're very , very focused on. i mean, in terms of looking at the portfolio and its performance, we have not yet seen a change in the overall credit quality of our portfolios. w e remain very mindful of that, given some of the headwinds that are on the forward, but if you look at metrics like our charge-of fs in the ﬁrst quarter , they were $154 million, net charge-of f rate of 0.4% unchanged quarter-over-quarter . and as we think about growing these particular businesses, underwriting standards and the credit box remain top of mind as we continue to grow . and to the extent we see indications signiﬁcantly slowing rates in terms of payments or the percentage of people making their minimum payments that are indications of future credit deterioration, that will be a signal for us and we can obviously take risk mitigating actions in the forward as a result.",1,2022
0,4,Mike Mayo,question,question," hi, if you could just, david and team, maybe just summarize where you think we are in terms of normalizing? you said equity underwriting would be below normal and maybe trading is way above. and i know nobody has a crystal ball and it's tough. but one of your competitor banks talked about volatility remaining elevated. and i don't know , just how should we think about the normalization of the legacy capital market businesses here? and also, how much did commodities contribute to this quarter? was it a record or close to a record?",1,2022
1,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," so, mike, i don't -- it's – and i know i just used it myself, i use the term normalization. we're talking about the equity capital markets business. it's very easy for me to look at equity capital markets revenues for the quarter and say , that's not a normalized run rate level for that business. i would also tell you that the equity capital markets revenues in the ﬁrst quarter of 2021 was not a normal level for the business. when you talk about the broad corporate investment banking business and the capital markets activity across both investment banking and end markets, again, i would amplify i don't have a crystal ball, i can't tell you exactly where it's going to settle out, but i think these are good businesses, where we have a high degree of conﬁdence that through market cycles, we can produce very nice returns in these businesses. we think it's a very powerful ecosystem combining these two businesses together with the global scale and footprint that we have. and we expect them to continue to be big contributors to accretive returns to allow us to meet our targets broadly . commodities was not a record. there's no question that when you look at the ficc macro business where there was really great performance, it was well diversiﬁed across rates, commodities and currencies. i mean the macro businesses certainly outperformed. but that's what i'd say to that point. so again, i'd go back, i think these businesses are in terms of available wallet for people like ourselves that compete in them they are fundamentally bigger than they were ﬁve years ago because the market cap growth around the world and that creates a good opportunity for us in addition we continue to invest in things in those businesses, which we think strengthen our competitive position. but it's hard for me to give you a predicted normal revenue number , it's just not that kind of business.",1,2022
2,4,Mike Mayo,question,question," all right. let me follow up a dif ferent way then. in terms of your market share improvement with your capital markets businesses with corporates, i know that's part of the, kind of, the one ﬁrm directive, can you -- do you have any metrics around that progress and how you're doing with corporates?",1,2022
3,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. i mean we -- i'll point out something that i think is an anecdotal metric, but i think it's interesting. w e have 100 -- when you open the m&a  lead table, which is something obviously we dominate, we have $155 billion lead for the quarter . that's the largest one quarter lead we've ever had in our history in the m&a  lead table. so that's a metric that's reﬂective of clients coming to us. w e're tracking our market shares quite closely across investment banking and also across global markets. and we've seen market share gains across both over the course of the last couple of years, and we'll continue to track them and make investments where we think we can strengthen them to make sure they're very durable.",1,2022
0,5,Brennan Hawken,question,question," good morning. thanks for taking my question. betsy asked about this broadly , but maybe more narrowly with greensky now closed. how should we think about loans? from my understanding, their loans were securitized, right? so, basically , is the idea that they will mature of f and as greensky underwrites new loans, then those loans would be on goldman's balance sheet, and so it would just sort of naturally migrate as the portfolio matures and is reissued? and should we think about it just getting to that roughly $10 billion level where greensky had been running? how should we think about that?",1,2022
1,5,David Solomon,answer,answer," so in terms of our strategy , we would expect over time that as greensky continues to originate, we would take those loans onto our balance sheet. w e certainly would retain the ﬂexibility to securitize some of that risk ourselves as they have previously . but the goal over time is to ramp up those balances onto our balance sheet. i think they had origination volumes of approximately $1.5 billion in the ﬁrst quarter . and so, we're stepping into them based on that level of activity , and our ambition is to continue to grow the origination with them.",1,2022
2,5,Brennan Hawken,question,question," great. thank you for that. and then, similarly , as far as deposits and deposit costs. what are the expectations for deposit beta in marcus for this rate hiking cycle? last cycle was a little unusual. it was a growing and newer platform, more established now. as a happy marcus customer and myself, i've been watching my yield that it hasn't really moved much, which is not that surprising, because we're just getting started. but how should we be thinking about that on a go-forward?",1,2022
3,5,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," fair enough. you're right to observe that we have not increased our market savings rate. look, in terms of how we're thinking about the deposit betas across the channels, i mean, that really -- you really need a through-the-cycle experience. w e have a certain expectation for these businesses that will prove out through the cycle. this cycle will be dif ferent than previous cycles. obviously , i would say at the very , very beginning part of the cycle, the experience is outperforming our expectations. but i think that's because we recognize that the maturity of our portfolio and our time in the business is less than some of our biggest competitors. but we remain really focused on managing that, continuing to drive deposit growth and support the other origination activities across our lending platforms.",1,2022
0,6,Devin Ryan,question,question," great. good morning, david and denis. maybe i'll just stick on the same theme here on consumer . i'd love to talk about just the consumer product road map and what we could expect from here, i'm sure you don't want to kind of give away your entire hand here, but just kind of what to think about as a natural extension coming next? and then obviously , with the apple news and kind of where they're going, how that af fects buy now pay later and any other kind of parts of the strategy in terms of timing?",1,2022
1,6,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," okay . great. thank you for the question. so in terms of our aspirations to build the leading global digital consumer bank, a lot of the pieces to the puzzle are in place at this point. a lot of those investments have been made, and we feel really good about the progress across the various lending and deposit platforms that we've invested in and built out. i mean to give you a sense, our active customers in the consumer space are north of $13 million now . and that number in the fourth quarter was less than $10 million. so we continue to see attractive active customer acquisition, both organically and inorganically , which is an important piece of the strategy . i think perhaps next up on the product road map will be the launch of checking. w e're already piloting that internally , and we expect to launch that more broadly to our clients later this year . and that will be -- i think that will be an important piece of the product road map for us.",1,2022
2,6,David Solomon,answer,answer," the only thing i would add to that, devin, is i just highlight back in the february update, we put out a $4 billion revenue target. and i just want to tie that target to what denis said when he said most of the investment was made. most of the investment to drive that revenue target is in the ground and so that's something i want to amplify . and then just ﬁnally , because you referenced it, our partnership with apple is very , very strong. while there's been a bloomberg article about what apple is doing apple or we have -- have not commented on the direction of that partnership and we spend a lot of time, and i would just say we're very comfortable with the opportunity set in front of us with that partnership.",1,2022
3,6,Devin Ryan,question,question," okay . terriﬁc. thanks for the color . quick follow-up just on the operating leverage in the model and maybe just starting on comp ratio. i know it's very the year , so it's hard to give much of a prediction. but comp ratio net provision was 100 basis points lower than the ﬁrst quarter of last year , even with, i would say , kind of an unfavorable mix. so is there anything we should read into that just around kind of how to think about the full year and just overall leverage on comp relative to revenues based on the current backdrop?",1,2022
4,6,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, as we've said always, we're a pay-for-performance culture. this is our best estimate is the right comp ratio based on the performance and the mix in the ﬁrst quarter . we manage this very closely . we're comfortable that we will pay people appropriately and competitively . and we will also obviously pay for performance. so i'm not going to speculate going forward, but you have data points from our behavior set on this over a long period of time. and we obviously -- the one thing i'd just highlight is our focus on our efﬁciency ratio, and that's something we want to think more about is comp and noncomp and driving to the efﬁciency ratio. and so that also affects our decision-making as we move forward.",1,2022
0,7,Dan Fannon,question,question," thanks. good morning. a question just on asset management with the nn deal now closed. do you see yourself as a scale provider with that property now? and then within that, maybe highlight or remind us what the opportunity set is with that business in terms of incremental growth now that it's closed?",1,2022
1,7,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure and i appreciate the question, dan. i mean i would say that we were a scale provider before that acquisition, but that acquisition certainly strengthens our position in europe. it opens that some interesting distribution channel, and it accelerates some of our capabilities around esg-oriented products. so, it was a good step forward to expand that growth. i believe -- carey will correct me if i'm wrong, it's the ﬁfth largest active asset manager in the world at the moment. w e see opportunity based on our footprint, our global position, our client mix, our strong position and alternative to continue to grow that business, both organically and potentially inorganically as we did with nn, and so we're going to continue to strengthen our position there, but we see a lot of upside across the business platform and continue to be excited about our capabilities and alternatives and our ability to expand that opportunity for the ﬁrm.",1,2022
2,7,Dan Fannon,question,question," that's helpful. i guess just in similar context with wealth in terms of the outlook for growth, that's also an area where there has been a fair amount of consolidation within the industry . do you see yourself as a potential participant in that? and maybe kind of the acceleration of hiring and/or some of the initiatives you put in place, how are you thinking about kind of the growth of the wealth business at this point?",1,2022
3,7,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, you can see from our earnings, the growth of the wealth business year-over- year. we continue to be focused on that opportunity . and i'd just highlight that that's a process that takes time. you add wealth advisers, you add footprint. it's a slower growth -- it's a slower process if you do it organically . but we see it as a very big opportunity . i think we have an aspirational brand in the wealth space. it's only been the last couple of years ﬁrst with the united capital acquisition and also to our aeco channel, we're meaningfully expanding our distribution of wealth products and corporations that we've been focused on really broadening that footprint. i think we're of f to a good start there, but i think there's a lot of organic opportunity to still exist i think our ayco channel, goldman sachs ayco is a very , very unique platform to work through corporations. and i do see a trend in this competitive environment where corporations are more focused on helping our employees with wealth management services.",1,2022
0,8,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," good morning. david, you made an interesting comment about when you were asked about the pipelines that it takes a little while for the potential issue is to realize that they need to reset maybe their expectations. in your experience, how long does it take -- assuming markets don't come roaring back, and i'd say they stay below they were maybe 6 months or 12 months ago, how long does it take for that reset to ﬁnally say , okay , yes, we still need to raise the capital, even though it's at lower levels than we originally would have liked?",1,2022
1,8,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes, i think, gerard, it's a hard question to answer very speciﬁcally and some of it depends on what kind of pressure the business that's making those decisions is under . but i think if you want me to make a very generic generalization, these are not things it doesn't take a year for people's mindset around the reality of markets to reset. it's more something that happens real time over months or quarters.",1,2022
2,8,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," very good. and then as a follow-up to another comment you made, you talked about how the global capital markets today versus ﬁve years ago are much larger , which obviously we have seen. how much of an impact do you think the quantitative easing by the global central banks? because i think now it's over $30 trillion of those balance sheets that are outstanding. w e all know the us fed is that $9 trillion, up from $4 trillion at the start of the pandemic. when we go into qt  in the us at least, they're going to bring those balances down. what kind of ef fect -- any color on what you think may happen versus what happened over the past ﬁve years when those balances blew out?",1,2022
3,8,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, there's no question that -- and i've tried to say it in dif ferent ways, and there's no science to this. and no one knows obviously , where the macro environment goes as we go forward. but when you look at the volumes and the levels of 2020 and 2021, we've said repeatedly that those volumes were at levels that were not sustainable and are a reﬂection of some of that monetary ﬁscal policy . that doesn't mean when you contract the monetary and ﬁscal policy that these businesses go away and contract proportionately . i think these are big businesses. there’ s a lot of capital raising advisory work and intermediation and ﬁnancing that will continue to go on. but there's no question, it's not going to operate at the levels that we saw in 2021.",1,2022
0,9,Jim Mitchell,question,question," hey. good morning. maybe just talk about the bank a little bit. you've kind of stealthily grown the us bank to be sort of almost a top 10 player . i appreciate some of the color around the loan book and its rate sensitivity , but the bank balance sheet is almost three to four times the size of the loan book. so can we -- can you give us some sense of how we should think about asset sensitivity in a rising rate environment in the bank? and if there's -- we'd like to think that there's some material upside there given the size of the bank?",1,2022
1,9,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. thank you for the question and to help through that. i think there's a couple of thing that we expect over the balance of the year and beyond as we move through this rate cycle. on the one hand, we do expect to continue to originate balances and as it relates to our own balance sheet sensitivity , that is modestly asset sensitive. so when you take that feature combined with increased quantum of interest-earning assets given the forward curve, we think that will be a beneﬁt to the ﬁrm. the other thing that i should mention, which is separate, but probably also important just to be clear on and that is, in the past, we had made reference to the impact of a rising rate environment on our money markets business and the impact that fee waivers had and the roll-of f of fee waivers may have on the forward. i would just point out that in the ﬁrst quarter , we had fee waivers of about $80 million versus in the fourth quarter was about $150 million. and on the forward, we expect those to be negligible. so, that too, obviously only a one-time beneﬁt with the ﬁrst hike, but that should provide some tailwind to our results as well.",1,2022
2,9,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," i'd also to highlight -- i'm sorry , jim. i'd also just highlight that we continue to grow deposits, and deposits are important for funding. so, our bank has many activities across the ﬁrm. and obviously , we're growing our lending businesses. but this strategy also af fects our market businesses positively too.",1,2022
3,9,Jim Mitchell,question,question," no, absolutely . i just -- i'm trying to think through ex the market's nii, which obviously tends to be liability sensitive. but if we just think about the bank, the loan book you've disclosed, i think, within the bank, something like $800 million to $900 million from a 100 basis point move, is it at least fair to say that the bank in total would nii beneﬁt from a 100 basis point move would be better or worse. just trying to get -- think through the other parts of the balance sheet and how that nii can react and what that growth could look like if there's a way to frame that?",1,2022
4,9,David Solomon,answer,answer," yeah. look, i think i would just refocus you on my comments previously . overall, nii sensitivity is modestly asset sensitive, i think, just given the relative size, even though we've grown it substantially , given our relative size, relative to some of our larger competitors. and i think that proxy that i of fer you on behalf of the ﬁrm is a good way of thinking about it.",1,2022
0,10,Andrew Lim,question,question," hi, good morning. thanks for taking the questions. so ﬁrst of all, can we talk about your management of the efﬁciency ratio? last year , it seems to be more volatile than usual. i guess, in the ﬁrst three quarters, it ran at quite a low level. and then in the fourth quarter , it seems like you had some, kind of, like cost true-up both for compensation, but also for non-comp. i was wondering if we should expect the same thing again for this year , the ﬁrst three quarters running at a lower level and then the fourth quarter being higher . and then what would you guide to really for the full year as a whole?",1,2022
1,10,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," okay . thanks very much for the question, andrew . i think as david indicated, from an overall framing perspective on ﬁrm-wide operating expenses, we have put out this efﬁciency target of approximately 60%, and that is a target and a lens through, which we look at the combined set of expenses, compensation and non-compensation. the compensation level that we set for the ﬁrst quarter , obviously , our best estimate right now based on what we pay for the full year , but i could not predict for you at this point, what our full year compensation ratio will be. that will be a function of our performance, the competitive landscape and our attention to the overall efﬁciency level efﬁciency ratio. on the non-comp side we’re making decisions and taking steps to manage non- comp growth where we can make the types of investments that we think are important strategic investments for the long-term strength and growth of the ﬁrm like in areas such as technology and trying to manage other non-compensation expenses that are less strategic.",1,2022
2,10,Andrew Lim,question,question," great. thanks. and then just switching type as a follow-up question. you seem to be a leader in the crypto and blockchain space, it's been a few years coming now for banks to try and get some products of f the ground. but maybe this year , you might see something a bit more material. so i was just wondering if you could talk a bit more about what we could expect maybe this year in terms of your product pipeline and what could be commercialized in the crypto and blockchain space?",1,2022
3,10,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, at a high level, andrew , what i'd say is we're certainly engaged with our clients around their interest in the space. but in terms of our product of fering and what we can do, we're really following a regulatory lead. but at the moment, the regulatory lead for big regulated banks is very restrictive and very , very small. i don't have great insight into how that will or will not change during the course of 2022, but we're engaged in dialogue with our clients. and certainly , when you think about blockchain more broadly in terms of how it supports the infrastructure, payment systems and other activities in the ﬁnancial markets, we're extremely engaged and invested in thinking about how goldman sachs participates in that and how that will af fect dif ferent business channels and business opportunities because that's to me a little bit separate from cryptocurrency - - clients' interest in cryptocurrency .",1,2022
0,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," hi. thanks so much. i guess just big picture, if we add back all the signiﬁcant items in the quarter , we're obviously still well short of the mid-teens targets. i know this is super slow times, like decade lows in investment banking, and you're in the process of hopefully reducing a lot of on-balance sheet stuf f. so i wonder if you could help us bridge the gap from here to there because in the back of our mind, we also have the potentially up to 25% increase in the denominator . so i wonder if you could bridge the gap of like how much is -- comes, do you think, from improvement in capital markets activity? how much is yet to be freed up capital from the denominator? i know it's tough but i want to say high level [indiscernible] pieces and thanks.",3,2023
1,0,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure, glenn, and appreciate the question. and so we'll keep it high level and let's separate into what we've got and then we can have a separate discussion about basel iii. but ﬁrst, we are simplifying the ﬁrm and kind of managing the ﬁrm to drive us toward the overwhelming majority of the ﬁrm to be in two core businesses, our global banking & markets franchise, which is performing very well in an environment that's not a great environment for that business. investment banking activities are well below 10-year norms. i don't think that will stay that way . but if you look at the performance of the business through nine months, that business, which is kind of 7% of the ﬁrm, that is two-thirds to 70% of the ﬁrm, that business is operating with a 13.4% roe and an environment that's not the best environment for that overall business. i can't tell you when the environment will get better , but i do believe that the capital markets and banking environment will improve in the coming years. history tells us that it doesn't stay short -- it doesn't stay closed for multiple years at a time. there is an adjustment. w e're making the adjustment. yes, the world's uncertain. as we mentioned, that could be a headwind. but i do think it will improve. and that business performs well. and we ﬁrmly believe that, that business is a mid- teens through the cycle business, the way we've materially grown our wallet shares, the way we've grown our ﬁnancing footprint, which adds more balance to the business and with our market-leading franchises across that business. second, we have the asset & w ealth management business, which we believe is mid-teens or higher returns as we reduce the historical principal and make it a lower capital business. w e're on that journey . i think you see us making progress. w e've talked about how we've reduced the historical principal businesses -- the historical principal investments by $9 billion this year . we set a target for $15 billion by next year , which we'll meet and then close to zero two years later . and so that business, we have a high degree of conﬁdence we'll operate at mid-teens or higher as we reposition it. as we've also stated, we're reducing the drag in our platforms. w e're narrowing the platforms and reducing the drag. and we're relatively conﬁdent that over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll make materially more progress in that. so you add that up with what we have and i think you can get very comfortable with the mid-teens target. now, the basel rules. the basel rules, if they were implemented as they're position now would be a headwind to that but also that doesn't account for how we optimize and how we pass through pricing. w e've seen things before. i'm not to saying it won't be a headwind, but i don't want to speculate on what it would do to our targets until we actually understand how it's coming through and what we can do across our businesses to appropriately manage it. so we continue to be very optimistic about our view to deliver meaningfully higher returns to our shareholders. and when there's more clarity on basel, we're committed to giving you a clear picture of that view . but i wouldn't jump to a conclusion on it at this point. i'm not saying you are. i wouldn't jump to a conclusion on it at this point.",3,2023
2,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," okay . i appreciate that. one quickie follow-up on your prepared remarks. you mentioned a number of sectors that have yet to absorb the higher rates. i'm curious if you could give a little color either on which sectors or how meaningful that is. i'm thinking from more of the big picture economy standpoint, but that caught my ear . thanks.",3,2023
3,0,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. glenn, as i listened to you play it back, what i'd say , us economy has been more resilient. the ﬁscal stimulus has helped mute the material tightening of monetary conditions that's occurred. i'm still of the belief that there's been a lag with this tightening and across a broad swath of the economy , we will see more sluggishness. now that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be a recession, and certainly , there's a good debate on where this all lands. but we, again, in the past quarter materially tightened economic conditions. and i just think there's a lag in most sectors of the economy , not all, but most sectors of the economy . and i do think over the next two to four quarters, the impact of that tightening will be more evident and will create slowdowns in some areas. i am hearing as i interact with ceos, particularly around consumer businesses, some softness, particularly in the last eight weeks in certain consumer behaviors. i don't want to over-amplify that because i think the economy and the consumer has been more resilient. but i think that gear from watching closely .",3,2023
4,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question, thanks so much.,3,2023
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," good morning. i guess maybe just one ﬁrst follow-up, denis. i just want to make sure i heard you correct. did you say you marked your cre exposure by 50% in cre ofﬁce? and on that, just give us a sense of visibility even beyond ofﬁce cre. clearly , it's a very manageable issue for you, but it remains sort of a source of nuisance and earnings noise. how much more do we have to go before this is kind of pinned down?",3,2023
1,1,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so, yes, to clarify , for our cre and cie exposure in the ofﬁce space, we've either marked or impaired that down by about approximately 50% this year . so that's -- i think that's quite signiﬁcant. w e started the year with about $15 billion of cre alternative investments. that's been reduced now by about $5 billion. 3/4 of that was either through paydowns or dispositions, the balance through marks and impairments. so we're making very , very signiﬁcant progress against those exposures. if you were to look at the same set of exposures in non-ofﬁce, the adjustment there through marks, our impairment is about 15% year-to-date. so we feel we've reduced a lot of notional appropriately reﬂected the valuations in those positions. but as indicated by our targets, we intend to continue to move down those exposures.",3,2023
2,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," got it. and i guess just a separate question. i mean, i think the capital markets environment, it is what it is. when you look at the ﬁrm over the next year or two, if maybe, david, where do you see the best growth opportunities? one, maybe talk about the client franchise and cap markets ﬁnancing. is that getting better or worse? and then there's a lot of talk about private credit, direct lending. you've talked about credit being an opportunity . just give us a sense of could that be a meaningful source of growth as we think about the next year or two?",3,2023
3,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. so in our global banking & markets franchise, we still believe that we have opportunities with our focus on our execution to continue to grow our wallet share. we expanded our focus from the top 100 accounts to the top 150 accounts, and we also are expanding the granularity that we look at our accounts from the position of one, two or three as opposed to just top three. and so we still do see some wallet share opportunities but we obviously have a very strong wallet share. so that's not most signiﬁcant. w e are growing our ﬁnancing for our global banking & markets franchise, and we expect to continue to grow that ﬁnancing footprint, and we have a plan to continue to put more ﬁnancial resources toward growing that ﬁnancing footprint. and we do think that it has reasonable returns. and it also creates a virtuous cycle for our client franchise in terms of our overall wallet share because we're a signiﬁcant ﬁnancer with them. when you turn to asset & w ealth management, i think we've been very clear at our investor day , and mark stated this, that we think we can grow the revenues in that business by high single-digits. that is driven by our continued growth in management fees over time and the continued growth in the wealth management sector , where we are experiencing good growth, and we still see good opportunities in w ealth management to grow the franchise all over the world. and we've made continued progress on that journey . when you talk about private credit, we have, as you know , over $100 billion of private credit. w e've launched private credit vehicles. w e obviously have a very powerful ecosystem when you look at global banking & markets. and what we do with ﬁnancing, which we think can also be an asset & w ealth management opportunity for growth in private credit, but we would expect signiﬁcant opportunity for the growth in private credit as a part of the overall growth of our asset & w ealth management franchise. so those are a handful of things i'd highlight at this point.",3,2023
4,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question, that's helpful. thank you.,3,2023
0,2,Christian Bolu,question,question," good morning. just another one on basel iii endgame. i appreciate that you think it's going to change and all that. but now that you've had a chance to digest the actual proposal as is, any more color on how you think it af fects the competitiveness of your markets businesses? are there any particular businesses that are more or less impacted? and then maybe give us some color on potential mitigation actions.",3,2023
1,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure, christian. i appreciate it. i mean, i'm going to talk very high level because, again, this is all ﬂuid. but obviously , if these rules went in place the way they're proposed, they would have an ef fect of the businesses. but it's dif ferent from business to business. there are certain activities that would meaningfully impact end users, whether they're corporates or individuals where it would be obvious that you'd pass on cost. a corporation that wants to hedge and comes to us and we sit opposite in an uncollateralized derivative. i can't imagine that their desire to hedge won't still continue even if the cost of that hedge is higher . obviously , it's some balance, they would think about that dif ferently . there are certain businesses where we might reduce our activity level because with the new basel rules, the terms don't look attractive. but there are others, and one i'd point to that's most obvious, which by the way, a signiﬁcant part of the impact to us would be is prime, okay? there aren't a lot of alternatives for big institutions in the prime business. there are very few in europe, a little bit, and obviously , the europeans, if this was implemented this way , would have an advantage. but at the end of the day , there are a handful of scale players. there are lots of scale institutions that need that service. our belief is we'd be able to optimize and pass on pricing in a reasonable way . we'd have to look at the ﬁnal rules. w e'd have to adjust. so it will af fect behavior . it will af fect pricing. it will af fect optimization. but i know everybody wants to jump to the clear answer , i think you need to see the rules, and then institutions and end users need to adapt to the new reality , whatever it is. and it's not binary that it only af fects us or others in the industry that are obviously be a process of working through that, as we have in the past.",3,2023
2,2,Christian Bolu,question,question," got it. thank you. that's helpful. maybe a question on the platform businesses here. i just have a two-part question. i guess ﬁrstly , maybe just update us on how you're thinking about the partnership with apple. can the economics work for goldman in the current states or does it make sense to further think about disposing of that partnership? and then the second question is more on the credit quality in your senior credit cards. kind of what are you seeing in terms of credit quality in that portfolio? how does it compare to your expectations and the broader sort of credit card industry?",3,2023
3,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," all right. i'll start on the ﬁrst part, denis will make some comments on credit and the portfolio. first, i think we hired a gentleman, bill johnson, who's got decades of experience to help us better run and better optimize the credit card portfolio, the credit card partnerships. as we've stated to you a number of times, and i'll repeat it here very clearly , we've worked to narrow our focus. you've seen us execute around marcus loans and greensky . our partnerships with apple and gm are long-term contracts, and we don't have the unilateral right to exit those partnerships. so our focus at the moment is on managing them better , getting rid of the drag and bringing them to proﬁtability . and we're making progress, both in the way we run them and against the cost base that we put against them. and bill johnson joining is helping with all that. w e'll continue as we go forward to work constructively with our partners and examine what's best in the long run for goldman sachs. but our core focus is on reducing the drag over the course of the next 12 to 24 months and ensuring we operate them better . denis, do you want to comment a little bit on the credit quality that we're seeing?",3,2023
4,2,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. what i'd add is we obviously remain very focused on the overall credit quality of the portfolio. a couple of things to bear in mind. in consumer , the net charge-of f ratio for the quarter was 5.1%, down from 5.8% last quarter and the total dollar amount of charge-of fs down as well. you'll also see that our coverage ratio now stands at 13.3%, which we think is an appropriate level, given our expectations for the portfolio. that adjustment is basically a function of greensky being removed from that ratio. and so now that applies to the cards portfolio, but we feel good about where that stands right now . on the overall performance of credit on the forward, we'll continue to be focused. w e made a number of adjustments to our credit underwriting box, and we'll continue to monitor that as we move through the economic environment.",3,2023
5,2,Christian Bolu,question,question, great. thank you.,3,2023
0,3,Steven Chubak,question,question," hi. good morning, david. good morning, denis. so david you had alluded to increased competition for talent driving some pressure on expenses. i was hoping you could just speak to the commitment to deliver on the 60% efﬁciency goal? and maybe more speciﬁcally , given changes in revenue mix, some recently announced business exits and the heightened competition you cited, how that's going to impact your ability to deliver on that 60%, if at all?",3,2023
1,3,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. so we continue to be committed to the 60% efﬁciency ratio. but as you know , we're moving through, we're narrowing our focus. w e're moving through some things that we're trying to create more transparency on, steven, and highlight for you. i'm going to turn to denis to make sure that we get the number right. but ex those one- off items, the efﬁciency ratio for the quarter would have been?",3,2023
2,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer, about 64.6%.,3,2023
3,3,David Solomon,answer,answer," okay . so putting it in perspective, i think it's important to highlight that we don't think the things that we're highlighting continue in perpetuity . we're trying to narrow the focus and when we look at our global banking & markets business and our asset & wealth management platform, we think we have the right target. now back to your point, steve, about competition. the competition for talent, especially the best talent, remains very , very strong. and so we think we've got a very , very good talent ecosystem. i feel good about the hiring we're doing. i'd just highlight that for our analyst jobs out of university , we had 260,000 applications for approximately 2,600 jobs. there are over 1 million applications for employment at goldman sachs last year. very, very aspirational and desirous place to work, but the competition for talent remains high. and so we'll strike the right balance and making an investment in our talent. you heard denis talk about some of our efﬁciencies and the fact that the efﬁciencies allow us to make a reinvestment in some of our best talent. w e feel good about where we are, but we also believe that as we continue to execute on our strategy , which narrows our focus and keeps us focused on our two core businesses of global banking & markets and asset & w ealth management, that the efﬁciency ratio target that we're hiring -- that we're highlighting over the next few years is a reasonable target.",3,2023
4,3,Steven Chubak,question,question," that's great color . and just for my follow-up, a broader question on the sponsor outlook. alts fundraising, it's continued at a healthy clip, but pe is facing numerous headwinds, whether it's the lp  denominator ef fect, higher rates and just slower realization activity in general. i was hoping you could speak to the broader outlook for the sponsor business and the implications for both the sponsor booking activity as well as the alternative asset management business.",3,2023
5,3,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. so that broadly deﬁned sponsor community , steven, which really is the broad alternatives world, private capital world, the ﬁrst thing i'd just say is we believe strongly that there's still a very , very long-term secular growth trend that is intact and will continue. i think there's some very , very interesting macro dynamics. i believe there's over $70 trillion of assets held by baby boomers that sometime in the next 20 years either will be passed on to a younger generation for aggressive investment, will go to taxes or will go to charitable foundations, by the way , charitable foundations who also invest. so there's a very , very strong dynamic of good ﬂows and a shift, especially given the size of the public markets into private asset classes. and so we believe that's ﬁrmly intact. there's no question that the capital raising environment is more muted than it's been. i would say it was extraordinarily robust in 2020 and 2021 and very , very robust in an environment where monetary policy was incredibly accommodated. but there's no question that all of this investing can be successful as new vintages and a new reset environment are opened up even if rates are higher and they operate higher . the one thing i know about the sponsor community is they generally make money by selling assets, and the sponsor community owns an enormous portfolio of businesses, and they also make money when they buy new assets. they obviously have to buy new assets at dif ferent valuations with dif ferent ﬁnancing costs now . and what i'd say is for the last six quarters, the last 1.5 years, that community has been very quiet. in our dialogue, they are starting to see more interesting opportunities. and i would expect in the next 12 to 24 months, the level of activity in the sponsor community will increase again, both in terms of sales. it's one of the reasons why i'm optimistic on capital markets and our advisory activities look forward over the course of the next four to eight quarters but also in terms of new purchases. i'm not suggesting that it will go back to where it was in 2021. that would not be the norm, but if you look at kind of 10-year historical averages and the percentage of investment banking activity , the sponsor activity would make up, i would expect that you'll see it go back to those averages. and at the moment, we're well below those averages at the current point in time.",3,2023
6,3,Steven Chubak,question,question," very helpful, david. thanks for taking my questions.",3,2023
0,4,Brennan Hawken,question,question," good morning, david and denis. thanks for taking my questions i'd love to start on expenses and comp, and david, you just spoke a little to this when answering steven's question. but the comp ratio, we saw revenue growth broadly quarter-over- quarter and yet the comp ratio ticked up, which is rather unusual for goldman. denis, i know you layered in that there was nearly $300 million of severance year-to-date. was some of that in the third quarter or was there any unusual items impacting the comp ratio? or was this mostly just because of the competition for talent? thanks.",3,2023
1,4,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so in terms of third quarter , it was very , very small. w e previously disclosed $260 million of severance so there's a small amount of severance in the quarter . we just think it's important to continue to call that out and highlight it so you can track that over the course of the year . that obviously rolls into our overall ratio in terms of what we're thinking for the full year . and we made the adjustment to the comp ratio in the third quarter based on what our expectations are for year-end performance as well as what we expect to pay our people. and we're looking in top composition this being mindful that we continue to pay for performance, but also recognizing, in particular , across our core businesses, we have leading market shares in global banking & markets, record year-to-date ﬁnancing activity , record management fees year-to- date, record private banking and lending activities year-to-date. and these are the bedrocks of our business for the foreseeable future. and we think it's important that we continue to recognize and retain the talent associated with those businesses that are going to unlock our mid-teens returns in the future.",3,2023
2,4,Brennan Hawken,question,question," okay . thanks for that, denis. and then when you're thinking about -- thanks for all the color on those cre and the exposures. when you're thinking about these historical principal investments that you're intending to continue to sell by the end of next year , what portion of those are cre or cre-related? is it possible to give any color around the assets that you're looking to sell and how exposed they are to cre or other sectors?",3,2023
3,4,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so i made a comment earlier . if you look at aggregate cre-related on-balance sheet investments and you look across asset classes like loans, debt securities, equity securities, and remaining exposure of equity in our cie portfolio, that, in aggregate, now stands at a little bit under $10 billion, $9.7 billion and down already $5 billion year-to-date. there are portions of some of those exposures that relate to our ﬁrm-wide activities, our cra  obligations and some co-invest exposures. if you look at the -- in aggregate, about 43% of the cre on-balance sheet investments is hpi, and that's what we're looking to sell down over time.",3,2023
4,4,Brennan Hawken,question,question, great. thanks for that color .,3,2023
0,5,Mike Mayo,question,question," hi. the pivot's not new . it's been advertised. i guess what's new is the actual losses. so looking back, who is accountable and who pays the price for the losses with greensky , the marcus loans and a consumer expansion strategy that was wider than you want it to be now? and then looking ahead, once you eliminate what you want to eliminate both on the consumer side and principal investments, how much would that alone improve roe? thanks.",3,2023
1,5,David Solomon,answer,answer," thanks, mike. appreciate the question. the leadership of the ﬁrm, which includes myself and the other senior leadership, are responsible for everything that happens here and everything that we do for our shareholders and for our people. so obviously , we're responsible and accountable for any decision that we make. i said publicly before that i'm happy that we pivoted. as you say , the pivot is not new . we've made the pivot. w e said we were going to do certain things. with hindsight, you will do certain things dif ferently . we obviously reﬂect. w e learn from the things that we do. but i think it's important for companies to try things, for companies to learn and adapt. when you make a decision that you think is a wrong decision for shareholders and the ﬁrm, you adjust accordingly . so we're doing that and we're moving forward. the second part of the question was?",3,2023
2,5,Mike Mayo,question,question, how much does roe improve simply by discarding of your extra principal investments and the remaining consumer businesses you want to get rid of?,3,2023
3,5,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, i think we've given you a bunch of transparency , mike, just looking at this. but if you look at what created a drag to roe this quarter , 75% of the drag to roe this quarter were the impairments and the rough [indiscernible] on the historical principal investments. and if you look over the last few quarters, the most signiﬁcant impact on roe performance has been the historical principal investments. now also, there were beneﬁts from those historical principal investments historically . but in this environment, obviously , you don't see that. w e think it's a better business to release that capital and run a fund business, a lower capital fund business, and so we're driving that. i think earlier in the call, we talked about the through-the-cycle performance of the banking and markets business. you can see the banking and markets roe right now and also the forward roe of the asset & w ealth management business with less capital in it. the drag from the platforms is getting smaller . and over the next 12 to 24 months, it will get smaller , too, hopefully eradicated. and so that will give you a cleaner roe that we continue to believe can be mid-teens through the cycle.",3,2023
4,5,Mike Mayo,question,question," and then what is your ability and appetite for more buybacks? basel iii, of course. but to the extent that you're discarding of the principal investments, that theoretically should free up more capital for either buybacks or reinvestment elsewhere. kind of what are your plans and what are your limitations?",3,2023
5,5,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. so i think denis highlighted this in the prepared remarks. w e've built a pretty big cushion and buf fer, given that we successfully reduced our scd based on actions we're taking. w e think that under the stress test, as we continue to reduce principal investments, we will have more beneﬁt to scd. now obviously , basel is out there and it's uncertain, so we're, at the moment, operating a little bit more conservatively around that, and we've highlighted that we probably will be a little bit more conservative on buybacks until we have more clarity . but we will continue to buy back stock. w e will continue to pay our dividend. and as we have clarity under this strategy , there should be meaningfully more capital release, which could ultimately beneﬁt to further buyback. but at the moment, we'd like -- we're going to be a little bit more cautious and have a little bit more clarity around the capital rules before we ﬂow ahead.",3,2023
6,5,Mike Mayo,question,question, all right thank you.,3,2023
0,6,Ryan Kenny,question,question," hi. good morning. thanks for taking my question. so wanted to follow up on the earlier questions on markets, maybe asked another way . so trading revenues are clearly extremely strong. industry wallet and both ﬁxed income and equities is tracking well above pre-pandemic levels, and you've been taking share. but looking forward, is there any scenario related to basel endgame where we see industry wallet size shrink? and as you think about higher for longer rates, how do you expect that, that impacts the various trading businesses?",3,2023
1,6,David Solomon,answer,answer," look, i think the intermediation activity for large institutions and corporations and governments around the world continues. the growth of the government in the world continues. the market capital world continues to grow and expand. i can't and i won't speculate on exactly where the ﬁnal basel rules wind up and how everyone optimizes through all that, but i don't think anything is changing in intermediation. and the need to ﬁnance the positions and the activities of so many of our clients is growing. and so i continue to think for leading players that have scale and global footprint and are in a leading position in these markets businesses, i think they're very well positioned in these market businesses. of course, there will be ups and downs in those businesses. but i think the businesses will continue to perform very , very well.",3,2023
2,6,Ryan Kenny,question,question, thank you.,3,2023
0,7,Devin Ryan,question,question," thank you. good morning, david and denis. w ant to come back to w ealth management. i know that the sale of personal financial management is a small business. but just if you can remind us how and where you want to compete in wealth management moving forward. and david, maybe give a little more color on some of those growth opportunities you alluded to that you're seeing there across the globe. thank you.",3,2023
1,7,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. so i appreciate that question, devin. our focus is on ultra-high net worth management where we have a leading franchise. i just highlight that ultra-high net worth management -- high net worth wealth management is still a very fragmented business. and while we have a leading franchise, leading franchise is kind of mid- single-digit share and we have less share than that in places like europe around the world. w e've seen really good growth in europe. w e see continued growth in the us. we have an ability as we put more resources on the ground and invest in more resources to cover clients to continue to grow that business. w e've seen good growth over the last ﬁve years. i think we have neat run rate room to do that. one of the decisions we made, and again, this is on focus and kind of a lesson learned is by selling united capital and selling pfm, which was a small business, as you highlight, it allows us to take the resources and the investment we might have geared towards growing that and add it to our investment in ultra-high net worth growth. and we think that's a better returning business and something we're very conﬁdent that we can continue to execute on.",3,2023
2,7,Devin Ryan,question,question," okay , terriﬁc. and then just a quick follow-up. so the $15 billion capital call facilities with signature bank, it sounds like you think that could help gain share with alternative asset managers. and you framed out obviously why that's such an important customer base for goldman sachs. so if you can, maybe give us a little ﬂavor for how that's going to help drive market share and how you think about where you sit with sponsorships, given how important they are as a customer for w all street, whether you have any sense of like where you are in the top three or where you can go from three to number one? or just any ﬂavor for where your market share opportunities exist there?",3,2023
3,7,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. in traditional investment banking services, we have leading share with sponsors across m&a  and leveraged ﬁnance. these capital facilities are key to the way they operate their business. and while we've been in the business of capital facilities, it is an area of growth for us, an area of lending growth for us. one of the things that was interesting about these portfolios is the portfolios bring a series of new clients to us where we haven't been a lender and we haven't been engaged in this activity , and it gives us an attachment to them. so this was an opportunity to expand an activity that we run meaningfully . again, i made this comment when we were talking about the global banking & markets business, ﬁnancing your clients strengthens your overall position with them because the ﬁnancing is important to them. and so as we continue to ﬁnance sponsors, i think it strengthens ready , very strong position with the sponsor community .",3,2023
4,7,Devin Ryan,question,question, understood. thank you.,3,2023
0,8,Daniel Fannon,question,question," thanks. good morning. i had a question on platform solutions. so for the quarter , if we exclude the write-down, is this a reasonable run rate for expenses? and as you think about achieving your target of proﬁtability in this business, is this going to come more from the expense side or revenue growth? and if you could also just give an outlook for transaction banking, just given revenues are down both sequentially and year-over-year .",3,2023
1,8,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thank you for the question. i don't think it's the right run rate. i think there's a combination of things that we expect over the next 12 months in terms of growth in revenue, composition of the clients as well as ongoing efﬁciency with respect to expenses. so i think we should be outperforming any type of run rate analysis. i think on transaction banking, we've tried to explain the strategic focus for us for that business, which is to grow a higher-quality client business over the long term. w e had grown quickly . we're now focused on growing with high-quality clients, high- quality deposits. as you note, the revenues and the deposit balances were down slightly sequentially , i think, reasonably in line with the industry , given some migration to other higher-yielding opportunity sets. but we did grow our client count. w e remain committed to the business and we think that it works very well with our overall investment banking franchise and footprint, and we think it could be a good value unlock over the longer term for goldman sachs.",3,2023
2,8,Daniel Fannon,question,question," thanks. and as a follow-up, you mentioned in terms of alternatives and the fundraising at the private equity challenges. but maybe if you could talk broadly about fundraising and some of the bigger funds maybe that you're in the market with today . and then also, as you think about the maturity of the business broadly within alternatives, how are you thinking about the contribution of incentive fees going forward? and when should we start to see those become a more material component of the overall revenue proﬁle?",3,2023
3,8,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so on the alternative space, our fundraising activity , $15 billion in the quarter , $40 billion year-to-date has been broad-based. w e have a broad-based platform. w e have mentioned the secondaries fund. david covered some of the private credit spaces. these are big areas of interest for our clients around the world. they're particularly relevant. w e expect to continue to invest in those platforms as well as across the platform more broadly . incentive fees come through as we get to the end of funds, we're in a position to start to distribute carry . so incentive fees will be lumpy . it will depend on the performance of dif ferent funds, but we expect that there will be more incentive fees next year and beyond. when we laid out at investor day the building blocks for our performance in the segment, we put on the page, not only the top line target information that david covered earlier , but also estimated incentive fees sort of on an annual basis. so i think that's a source of upside for us.",3,2023
0,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," thank you. good morning, david. good morning, denis. david, in the past, you -- and you talked about the ipos, the four that you guys were very involved with this quarter . but in the past, you talked about green shoots, and part of it was the convincing of private equity owners or companies that were owned by private equity that if they wanted to go public, they're going to have to recognize that the valuations today are far below where they were in 2021 at the peak of the cycle. are you ﬁnding those conversations easier today or are you ﬁnding more people are recognizing that's correct? and if they want to go public, they just had to accept it?",3,2023
1,9,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. i mean, i appreciate the question, gerard. i think absolutely , they're easier . and if you look at a handful of the companies that have gone public, you can look at their private market valuations two years ago versus the valuation now . but i don't think those discussions are difﬁcult. i think those discussions have a real sense of realism in them. and i think there are a number of companies that recognize the new environment and are focused on what they have to do to enhance themselves strategically .",3,2023
2,9,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," and gerard, i'd just add, it's actually especially helpful to have numerous real data points in market, both space for equities and across the leveraged ﬁnance space. so the conversations that we're having with our clients now who are looking to access the markets. they're informed by our leading role in insights into most of the activity that's been accomplished in the last several weeks. and so i think that is an incremental source of our optimism that we have those data points and that insight to share with clients and advise them on how and when they can get to market and what types of terms and pricing.",3,2023
3,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," okay , very helpful. and then as a follow-up, it's not a big line item obviously for you folks. but can you share with us some of the color in the transaction banking area? that was obviously a new business line that you guys created. just how is it going? i saw the revenues were down slightly , i think, sequentially . but what's going on in that line of business? and again, granted it's not a major line of business for you folks at this time.",3,2023
4,9,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. no. thanks, gerard. our transaction banking activity remains a strategic focus. the revenues and the deposit balances are down slightly on a quarter-over- quarter basis. those things are linked. w e have grown our client count, and we remain committed to making the investments to grow high-quality balances and clients in that business over the medium to long term. no change in strategy .",3,2023
5,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question, thank you.,3,2023
0,10,Saul Martinez,question,question," hi. thanks for taking my question. i wanted to drill down a little bit more on platform solutions. i think, denis, you mentioned that this quarter isn't necessarily a great run rate for expenses or revenues. but even this quarter , if i adjust for the loan markdown and the impairment, it seems like you -- my math is correct, you are ppnr positive. obviously , credit costs are high, the credit card book is seasoning and you're still growing that portfolio. but if you can just help us parse through some of the moving parts and help us understand the glide path to getting back to -- or getting to close to breakeven or breakeven over the next, say , 24 months?",3,2023
1,10,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thanks, saul. so just a couple of things on glide path to help with the question in the context. so rate of growth is important in a business like this that's been growing very , very quickly and obviously taking provisions in line with cecl. w e expect the growth rate for that activity has been slowing and could slow further , and that has some positive impacts. and then as david mentioned, we made a strategic hire of a very seasoned industry professional. i mean, we're working very , very closely with him on the overall operations of our platform. w e remain in discussions with our card partners and working carefully to improve the overall efﬁciency for the platforms for our clients and for goldman sachs. i think it's a combination of the way we're going to grow on the forward combined with we manage the expense and the operating efﬁciency .",3,2023
2,10,Saul Martinez,question,question," okay , that's helpful. and just maybe a quick follow-up there. i think you mentioned that ncos, net charge-of fs, were down this quarter . is that -- and you do have a 13.3 reserve coverage. it does seem like your maybe closer to a scenario where provisioning to come down quite a bit, especially under cecl. but just maybe just give us a sense of how you're feeling about the credit outlook. and is my assessment right that your reserving could -- especially if you slow down, it could come down pretty materially over the next year to two years?",3,2023
3,10,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so you have a couple of facts that are right. w e did have a charge-of f ratio that was down sequentially quarter-over-quarter from 5.8 to 5.1 and lower charge-of fs. w e are not necessarily predicting that's the ongoing path for credit in the consumer portfolio. it's something we're still mindful of, given the environment, given the vintages in which we've originated those exposures. w e do feel that the coverage ratio at 13.3 is appropriate, and we obviously set that based on our expected life of loan losses. so as we move forward, our expectation is we'll continue to see elevated charge-of fs. and as you look at our reporting on that with greensky pulled out of the consumer line, you'll have a more pure look at the cards platform, and we do expect that will show elevated charge-of fs.",3,2023
4,10,Saul Martinez,question,question, okay . great. thank you.,3,2023
0,11,Mike Mayo,question,question," hi. just a clariﬁcation on my prior question. so if i have this right, you reduced your pe investments by $3 billion quarter-over-quarter , and that allowed a $2.5 billion reduction in capital allocated to the asset management and w ealth segment. i mean, is that completely correlated. so if you get rid of the $21 billion of remaining principal investments, would that free up, say , $16 billion? is that ballpark right?",3,2023
1,11,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," no. mike, i think when we started talking about the reduction of our historical principal investments over time, we gave a number of about $9 billion of capital release for the entire portfolio. so i don't think -- i'd be happy to get on with you and sort of work through your numbers, but i don't think we have $16 billion incremental on the forward, signiﬁcantly less than that.",3,2023
2,11,Mike Mayo,question,question," so how much do you have left that once you discard the $21 billion that remains, how much capital should be freed up?",3,2023
3,11,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," i mean, on a year-to-date basis, based on the activity that we've undertaken, that's a release of about $2 billion, to give you a sense. so we probably have remaining mid- single digits.",3,2023
4,11,Mike Mayo,question,question," okay . and as far as the comp ratio, should we consider these onetime charges as part of comp or would that be excluded when we think about our models?",3,2023
5,11,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so we obviously have to include it for the purpose of the comp ratio accrual. w e do think of them as more onetime in nature. w e, as you know , did a headcount reduction earlier in this year . that's not our current expectation to repeat that. if anything, we think that the work we've done to right-size the ﬁrm is something that puts us in a position to now make more selective investments in our headcount on the forward. so we don't expect that type of severance to repeat itself. and we are taking into account as we set the compensation ratio, that severance payments is obviously not available to pay those employees that remain with the ﬁrm. w e're very focused on pertaining to continue to drive the franchise.",3,2023
0,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," hi, thanks a lot. so, obviously , really good trading results, but you mentioned also on the ﬁnancing side, how good it was. i'm curious on the amount of deleveraging that we've seen in april, i'm assuming that's pretty good for intermediation, but how do we think about that in terms of the short-term impacts on ﬁnancing until we get a kind of reload of leverage?",1,2025
1,0,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," good morning, glenn. it's denis. i'll take that. i think when you think about the components of our overall ﬁnancing, the reality is we continue to see signiﬁcant demand across the client base for both our ficc and equity ﬁnancing. i think what you're referencing given change in asset prices and market activity , we did have a level of record average prime balances over the course of the ﬁrst quarter , but it's reasonable to expect that some of those balances come down as asset prices reset and then you'll continue to support clients with their ﬁnancing needs, but perhaps of f of a lower base given the adjustment in market prices.",1,2025
2,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," i mean, is that like material in terms of the impact? and when you're at record pb balances and then you have the amount of deleveraging that we saw in early april, if it stays at this level, is that a major contributor to the growth in ﬁnancing in the quarter?",1,2025
3,0,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," i would not characterize it as material or major . you have a number of things happening at the same time. you have deleveraging activity on behalf of clients and you have changes in their overall level of balances, but you also have lots of dif ferent types of activity as clients reposition their portfolios and make sure that they adjust for their evolving views on the outlook.",1,2025
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," hey, good morning. i wanted to follow up on glenn's question. i guess, denis, i think the view is the world in-markets changed a little bit come april 2nd, and the risk from an investor standpoint is activity fallen of f the clif f. it's negative for ﬁnancing. it could be negative for trading. so i'm not sure if you have data in terms of the 10 days for april. and if you can give us -- if you can contextualize just how negative the last 10 days have been following a very strong 1q and how we should think about just where clients are as we go back to debating good volatility versus bad volatility?",1,2025
1,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," yeah. i'm going to start, and denis can jump in. but i'd say a couple of things. first of all, obviously , no one can argue that april 2nd, a handful of things happened that shifted perspectives. but i would say there were things going on before april 2nd that we're shifting perspectives that also led to more activity . so there's no question, and we've talked about this publicly a bunch that we started to see growth showing and slowing in late january and early february . we obviously saw signiﬁcant moves in equity markets as people positioned for a dif ferent kind of trade policies during march, and we saw signiﬁcant moves in the march period, which actually led to higher activity for us in a variety of ways. w e're early in the quarter , and so far the business is performing very well and clients are very active. and so, i know there is a higher level of uncertainty , but at the same point, clients are active, people are shifting positions, and we still see signiﬁcant activity levels. i mean, denis, do you want to add to that at all?",1,2025
2,1,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," no, i think that captures the sentiment of where you're coming from, ebrahim. w e obviously have a diversiﬁed set of business activities, many of which work well together , some of which mitigate each other . i think the point is, given all the changes in the market and outlooks, our clients have been very active and all the investments that we've made in our franchise with our clients, all the resources we deploy to them and on their behalf has put us in a position to be active with them.",1,2025
3,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," got it. and if i could follow up, denis, you mentioned executing on the three-year efﬁciency plan and the pyramid structure. just talk to us, i think there were some headlines last month around, i guess, regular sort of merit-based review of the headcount, like what we are doing on the expense side as we think about the 60% efﬁciency target and maybe some resiliency to earnings on the cost side that we could expect? thanks.",1,2025
4,1,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thanks, ebrahim. i appreciate the question. and obviously , we went through on our call in january this three-year efﬁciency program, which is something we're very committed to, and we're underway in terms of the execution they're under . a lot of the focus of that is to free up capacity for us to make greater investments in technology . but that program had aspects, as you referenced that relate to, pyramid structured also had management of non-compensation spend, and we are looking at and managing all those line items very carefully . to your question on pyramid at headcount, in particular , our expectations that we will undergo our regular annual performance management process, i would expect that we'll record a severance charge in the second quarter of approximately $150 million in connection with a number of those actions.",1,2025
0,2,Christian Bolu,question,question," good morning, david and denis. maybe just staying on the topic of the markets businesses, i wanted to talk about the competitive landscape. you guys did very well in the quarter on an absolute basis, but it did lag peers in the quarter . and i appreciate it's just one quarter . you do have a track record of share gains, but just curious what you're seeing currently on the competitive landscape in markets.",1,2025
1,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," yeah, i think, christian, we feel incredibly strongly about the way our business is positioned and the way it's performing. the comment you referenced, obviously , the way you look at these things is to go back and look at the ﬁrst quarter last year , we had an extraordinary ﬁrst quarter where we massively outperformed, and so we've got a tougher comp. but the strength of our position, we feel good about the client feedback we get is extraordinary , particularly at times like this. and i think we'll continue to execute very well along the continuous pattern that we've executed on is a leading provider in these activities and it feels that way .",1,2025
2,2,Christian Bolu,question,question," okay . thank you. on the buyback, i know it’ s impressive that you guys stepped it up fairly meaningfully in the quarter . what was the catalyst that drove the step-up in the buyback? w as it the share price level, just excess capital? i'm just trying to understand if this level of buyback is sustainable going forward.",1,2025
3,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. thanks, christian. obviously , we did note that the level of buybacks for us in the ﬁrst quarter was a record. i think our philosophy with respect to capital deployment remains very consistent. first and foremost, we're making available the capital to support the client activities that come into the ﬁrm, obviously , focused on a sustainably growing dividend. and then we calibrate our share buybacks relative to how we want to manage the ﬁrm's overall capital position in light of the environment. and as you've seen us over the last couple of years take a number of strategic measures to sort of reduce certain balance sheet exposures. ultimately , we have to get the capital out of the system, and that will help our long-term return proﬁle. so we had a lot of earnings generation. w e took the opportunity to buyback some of our stock while ensuring that we still entered the second quarter with a level of capital where we are operating above the wide end of our target operating range to make sure we're in a position in this quarter to support client activity and continue ﬁrst and foremost to support clients, but then also continue to return capital to shareholders.",1,2025
0,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question, hi. good morning. can you hear me okay?,1,2025
1,3,David Solomon,answer,answer," good morning, betsy . yeah.",1,2025
2,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question," thank you. so, on the capital question, david, earlier in the prepared remarks, you're talking about the regulatory changes that are being anticipated. and the question i have for you is on the slr ratio. i believe it's one of the ones you're tighter to. and it would be helpful to understand how you're thinking about if the changes come through as being discussed, take treasuries out of the denominator of the slr. is that something that would be a noticeable beneﬁt for you? is that something that you think you could lean into relatively quickly? or give us a sense as to how you plan on using these improvements in capital as they come through? thank you.",1,2025
3,3,David Solomon,answer,answer," yeah. so ﬁrst of all, betsy , i think you've got to look at this as a very holistic thing because there's a lot going on from a regulatory perspective and de-reg that i think will be a tailwind for the industry broadly . and obviously , it includes slr reform to the degree it comes. it includes capital reform to the degree it comes. it includes supervisory form to the degree it comes. and so, it's a big package of things. w e are cet1 constrained, not slr constrained at the moment. but i do think for the system broadly , slr relief would have a beneﬁt to treasury markets. i think it's an important structural reform. and certainly , you've heard messages from both the fed and from treasury that this is a very , very high priority . and so, we're certainly hopeful or optimistic given the way they've been messaging around that that there'll be activity on that, and i think that's broadly good for the system. i think secondarily , across capital more broadly , whether it's basel iii, it's ccar and transparency and continuity and stability around that process and also gsib, we're certainly over the last decade that was supposed to be scaling based on market cap growth and economic growth, i think there's room for material tailwinds around capital. but most importantly , we hold -- all of the industry holds large buf fers, but as we don't have consistency and transparency around these things and any improvement at a minimum would return capital into the system if you had better transparency . so we're hopeful on that. and then on supervision, there are headwinds in costs and activities that we've had to deploy over the last few years to respond to what i'd say was an unusually high-level of supervisory activity , we see already a dif ferent tone around some of that dialogue. and ultimately , that allows us to deploy resources in different places, many of which can support investment and growth as opposed to just regulatory response. so i continue to believe, even in this environment, that there will be progress on this. w e obviously don't know how this will unfold, but the messages i'm getting leave me optimistic that there will be progress, and that's very good for the industry as a whole.",1,2025
4,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question," okay . thanks so much. denis, one for you on v ar, value-at-risk. this quarter was down broadly throughout the dif ferent categories q-on-q, which i thought was interesting given the heightened volatility that we had across a variety of dif ferent markets. can you remind us how volatility impacts v ar and how we should be thinking about v ar efﬁciency , which clearly went up dramatically , and just wanted to understand how to think about that on a go-forward basis? thanks.",1,2025
5,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thanks, betsy . good question. so obviously , there's multiple components to var across the various asset classes and then a diversiﬁcation ef fect as well. over the course of the ﬁrst quarter for our average daily v ar, we had reduced exposures offset by elevated levels of volatility . so you obviously have both factors across asset classes that factor into the calculation. but to your question, obviously increased or persistent levels of volatility could have upward pressure on a v ar measure.",1,2025
0,4,Mike Mayo,question,question," hi. i mean -- i guess it's good you can have record buybacks and the cet1 ratio doesn't change much. on the other hand, i guess you bought back stock quite a bit higher at the current price, and i know you're not marketizing this or anything. so i'm guessing that reﬂects your conﬁdence in the amount of excess capital you'll have with the $40 billion new share buyback. so i was just wondering if you could put a little more meat on the bones or the reasoning behind the $40 billion buyback? and speciﬁcally , this reg fd costs, you give material information, how much capital do you think could be freed up once you dispose of your private investments, you've chopped a lot of wood there, i think that's $8.8 billion. and after you -- if and when you dispose of your credit cards? thank you.",1,2025
1,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," okay . i'll start. denis can jump in. i mean, i hate, mike -- i appreciate the question. i hate to go back to denis' message, but i think -- and you and i have spoken about this over the years. our number one priority is to deploy capital in the business where we can get marginal returns. w e've done that consistently over the last ﬁve years. w e've grown our business. w e've deployed capital, but we've also been very clear that if we don't see places to deploy that capital and we have excess capital, we're going to consistently return it, including sustained growth in the dividend, where we've made a lot of meaningful progress. w e've grown the earnings of the ﬁrm materially , and that's generating a lot of capital. and as denis highlighted earlier , if we don't have a place to go in the business immediately , we have to return it. w e can't market time, and so we'll return it consistently . we are conﬁdent that we're going to continue to have a big, diverse, strong-earning business. w e are conﬁdent that we will have capital available to deploy when there are opportunities, but if we don't, we will continue to actively return it to shareholders. there will be some quarters where the stock price is higher , some quarters where the stock price is lower , but we're going to stick to that capital return philosophy , and i think it serves us very, very well. i think we've proven over a long period of time, certainly over the 26 years that we've been public, that we are very good stewards of capital. if we can't deploy it in the business for incremental returns, we're going to return it, get it back.",1,2025
2,4,Mike Mayo,question,question, was denis going to add to that?,1,2025
3,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," you don't have to if you don't have anything to add, but you can.",1,2025
4,4,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," do you have any follow-up question, mike?",1,2025
5,4,Mike Mayo,question,question," well, it's just a speciﬁc amount of capital that could be freed up if and when you dispose of your private investments and your credit cards? it seems like that could be a pretty big number .",1,2025
6,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," yeah. sorry , mike. i didn't get to that. yeah, i didn't get to that. denis can certainly make a comment on that.",1,2025
7,4,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so if you look at the hpi portfolio, we have approximately $4 billion of attributed equity , maybe a tad underneath that, and a reasonably similar amount across hard portfolio. that gives you some context for the aggregate magnitude.",1,2025
0,5,Steven Chubak,question,question," hi, good morning, david. thanks for taking my questions. i had a two-parter on alternatives, david. i was hoping you could speak to bigger picture, just the outlook for sponsor activity across the complex, given some of the headwinds to realization activity as well as the heightened macro uncertainty you cited. and then just drilling down to the third-party alts disclosure, what contributed to that fee rate contraction on the credit side, just given the step down was meaningful? and i know that's a high priority growth area for you and the management team.",1,2025
1,5,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, ﬁrst, i'll comment on the macro, steven. the size of the sponsor community , the amount of capital that's deployed, the assets that they hold and they control, it's quite signiﬁcant. w e've been talking about this for the last few quarters. there's no question there's been a pickup in activity and monetization because there's enormous lp  community to increase dpi and start to bring this capital back. a macro environment will further put more pressure. that will be balanced by the fact that in the macro environment, some of the valuation expectations and realizations have to come down. i can't time it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. but the way i describe it, this is an enormous backlog that will come through the pipe at some point in time. and there's no ﬁrm better positioned to capitalize on that than goldman sachs. how that unfolds in the coming quarters will be activity . but i think more certainty with respect to the policy landscape will be needed to really accelerate that.",1,2025
2,5,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," and, steven, as you talk about fee rates coming through on the alts side, a number of dif ferent ways of feeding into our alts business, and they bring with them dif ferent levels of fees. so let’ s take two ends of the spectrum. as we've had some growing our ocio activities, a lot of those portfolios will include some component of alts and the fees in connection with that are lower . we obviously have sort of our own ﬂagship funds that we launched. w e gave some color on the types of asset classes that we're expecting to execute on over the near-term. that was a much higher level of fees. so overall, you see a 61 basis point disclosure, which was a couple of basis points of recent periods. but with the ﬂagship launches, i expect that would improve over time.",1,2025
3,5,Steven Chubak,question,question," that's really helpful color . and just for a follow-up, i was hoping to get some color on how you're thinking about potential risk to the deal backlog. certainly encouraging to see sequential increase in the fee backlog. but as we think about some of the risks, whether it's international and cross-border or speciﬁc sectors that are particularly challenged, how you're framing or potentially handicapping the risk of some of these deals coming out of the backlog?",1,2025
4,5,David Solomon,answer,answer," yeah. so i mean there are a couple of things, steven, that i'd say , ﬁrst of all, this is a little bit counterintuitive. but when the landscape changes, companies have to rethink their strategic positioning. and interestingly , when you look at dialogues, dialogues are increasing. now obviously , increased dialogues take a while to turn into deals and play through. but denis was quite clear we had a notable increase in our backlog. our backlog is up a lot during the quarter . obviously , revenues lag the period of deal announcements. so the backlog and the deal announcements are reﬂective of the second half of last year , the early part of this year . in a period of uncertainty , things will slow down. but again, it's a big complex world. there's a lot of change going on. dialogues are up. i do think for a period of time, there'll be some uncertainty around how certain things that were close proceed forward. but i would expect a signiﬁcant amount of m&a  activity through the rest of the year . but obviously , if the landscape got more constrained, there's a risk of it slowing. but we're continuing to be out with clients doing the things that we do. and i don't see anything at the moment that leads me to believe that it's a fundamental shift in that activity .",1,2025
0,6,Devin Ryan,question,question," great. good morning, david. good morning, denis. i want to continue the conversation, i guess, on the sponsors.",1,2025
1,6,David Solomon,answer,answer, good morning.,1,2025
2,6,Devin Ryan,question,question," good morning. on the sponsors, obviously , on the asset management side of the business, fundraising for alts has been terriﬁc. and as you guys pointed out, lps are waiting for capital, so there's a lot of, i think, pressure on sponsors to return capital, but the irrs on -- maybe the prior vintage that are being realized probably going to be great. so i'm just curious kind of your conversations with sponsors and fundraising. is this an opportunity? does it further dif ferentiate goldman? or just any other color given some of that tension between sponsors today and the market trying to return capital and what lps are demanding?",1,2025
3,6,David Solomon,answer,answer," yeah. first of all, it's not clear to me that the returns from that vintage, if it’ s realized over time, are going to be better or worse. i think it's early to say . but the big thing that's changing or putting pressure on fundraising, as the pace of capital return to the big capital allocators, has been less than they expected. and so as a result, because they're getting less back, the new capital that they're deploying into new funds is slowing until they get more back. that is balanced by the fact that we are still in long- term secular growth with respect to private assets and private asset allocation overall. and i continue to think that secular growth over the next 5, 10, 15 years is going to be meaningful as more people continue to shift to gain exposure to private assets. and by the way , that's not just institutional capital, i think you're going to see meaningfully more participation from individual investors and all sorts of forms the capital formation and potentially , ultimately , in retirement accounts, et cetera. so i think we're in the early stages of continued secular growth. i think the track record matters a lot and investment performance matters a lot. w e from an investment performance perspective, are very , very focused on performance. performance matters. w e have a good history over 30 years of performing in these strategies. i think that matters a lot. but i think these are short-term phenomenon against long- term strategic shifts. and while there can be bumps or slowdowns, et cetera, i think the long-term direction of travel is really quite clear .",1,2025
4,6,Devin Ryan,question,question," okay . that's excellent. thanks, david. and then just a quick follow-up on debt underwriting. it's been a really good story for goldman. so i just love to maybe just hear a little bit about some of the -- whether it's cyclicality in the business, some of the other puts and takes that are kind of driving results. and then just the outlook from here, just given that it does seem like you guys are taking some share there.",1,2025
5,6,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thank you. so, obviously , debt underwriting is a huge business for us. w e’ve been focused on it for a very , very long period of time. w e gave our sort of market share positions at number two, across the noninvestment-grade components and more like a four in certain of the investment-grade categories. it's a big business for us. it's an important business for us. and we have a track record, i think, importantly , of delivering, particularly when there are elevated times of uncertainty . we have a track record of being good risk takers in that business. and when clients see an opportunity that an environment like this presents and they need to turn to a trusted counterparty who has the capability and the risk appetite to step up and support them, i think we have a long-standing track record of doing that. the last several quarters have been more benign from a credit perspective. you've seen the balance of activity , more reﬁnancing and orientation, where we've obviously had a very meaningful role to generate our market share positions. but should there be opportunities on the forward to do more transaction-based activity , i think the ﬁrm is well set up to do that as well.",1,2025
0,7,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," look, i appreciate the question and the observation. w e're proud of how we've managed all of those metrics while delivering the type of performance and market shares that we have. i think the way i would phrase it is, we are accustomed to operating our ﬁnancial resources in a very nimble fashion, given where we sit. and i think our team collectively performed really well with what we refer to as keen eyes on risk management. w e also have a keen eye on ﬁnancial resource deployment. and so it is, as you see, it's a strong on a ﬁnancial resource adjusted basis. matt o’connor okay . and then separately , within the historical principal investment book, you had about a $600 million drop in a somewhat tough quarter . what's your thought process on the pace from here? and just remind us of that target, i think it was by the end of next year , you're targeting around $2 billion. just wondering if that's right and still stands? thank you.",1,2025
1,7,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. appreciate that. obviously , for the last several years, we have been reducing our historical principal investments, what we call hpi. several years ago, the balance was around $30 billion. if you went to the beginning of just last year , we had $16 billion and change of hpis. w e now sit with $8 and change billion of hpi. so we continue to meaningfully reduce those exposures. and we expect by the end of 2026, we'll have sold down the vast majority of exposures versus where we began, and we're committed to continuing to chip away at this. w e have dif ferent sub-asset classes priced the hpi. some are easier than others, but we have a plan to sell down, and we're going to continue to execute on that.",1,2025
0,8,Erika Najarian,question,question," good morning. so, my ﬁrst question is a follow-up on capital. so, david, given what you've said about the landscape and sort of freeing capital from the industry , we have strong momentum in terms of the stress test, gsib surcharge recalibration and then betsy mentioned the slr. and the question for you is, you are already one of the most optimized businesses and ﬁnancial services. if we do redeﬁne the deﬁnition of excess capital for the industry broadly and for goldman speciﬁcally , how are you going to allocate that freed-up capital? how does your -- where do your priorities go? i appreciate the whole -- the stack in terms of clients ﬁrst and buybacks. but within the ﬁrst within the business, are there any places where you would reallocate even more capital if we do free-up or change the deﬁnition of excess capital?",1,2025
1,8,David Solomon,answer,answer," appreciate the question, erika, and welcome to the team by the way . happy to have you. look, i know you're asking for probably more granularity than we'll give. but we have a zealous focus on ﬁnding opportunities to serve our clients. and when we need capital to serve them, making sure we have adequate capital to allocate there. obviously , a signiﬁcant -- if you look at our business today , and let's put the consumer -- what’ s left of the consumer platform aside for the moment, when you look at our business today , the additional capital that gets allocated into the business broadly gets allocated into the banking markets franchise. w e are prepared if there's opportunity there to allocate meaningfully more. but if there's not opportunity there, it's probably going to come back. that helps obviously support the growth in our dividend, the sustainable growth in our dividend. and it really is kind of our capital waterfall in the business or if not return it. i will say over time, and this all proportionate as we scale our alternatives platform, we use capital to start up new funds, to start up new platforms. so you could see some capital deployed there, but it's all going to be in the context of margin on that business. that business is running as a much more capital-light business on a go-forward basis than it did historically . and so if we do see this capital reform from a regulatory perspective, and i -- as i said earlier , i think there's a good chance of that happening, it is going to allow us to do two things. one, probably return more capital, but two, also in the context of how we think about things, ﬁnd some people where we can deploy a little bit more to support clients, but we're going to watch it very carefully . the marginal -- the excess capital that we're keeping, the cushion that we're keeping is high. i don't think that's a normalized thing. and it's not just us, you can look across the industry that everybody is going to run with these excess capital cushions. when we get more, i think, across the industry , there will be a reset of what those cushions should be when people feel like they're in a position to be able to plan over multiple years of the capital cycle.",1,2025
2,8,Erika Najarian,question,question," got it. and my follow-up question is this. so there's been increased questions from investors about how global investment banks like goldman, how the standing is impacted by some of the policy volatility , if you will, in terms of your internationally sourced revenues. and we had sort of two dif ferent answers from your peers on friday . jamie was a little bit more pessimistic. ted was a little bit more optimistic about the international revenue outlook going forward, given all of the global policy and david and denis, i wanted to get your thoughts on that, on whether or not what the us is doing could impact some of that sourcing.",1,2025
3,8,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, what we're hearing from clients, erika, and i mean this is important is to be talking to clients. what we're hearing from clients, particularly clients in europe and other places around the world, is they don't like the level of uncertainty , and they don't like the fact that certain constructs for how they interact with the us economic system, the global economic system are potentially changing. i would just say it's early to call heads or tails or direction of travel on how this will play out. w e're listening to it carefully . at the same point, we want a huge scale and global franchise all over the world. w e have extraordinary expertise and leadership positions and activities all over the world. and i don't see any decline in any way , shape or form of clients' interest in dealing with goldman sachs in any part of the world, and i don't expect that to change on any signiﬁcant basis. but certainly , as we engage with clients, we're hearing questions on these things. i think it's early to declare one way or another as to whether or not at the margin, there's any ef fect from that. at the moment, all over the world clients are extremely engaged with the ﬁrm.",1,2025
0,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," hi, denis. hi, david. denis, you mentioned in your -- in answering your question about the hpi portfolio that you guys had just over $4 billion of cet1 capital, i think it was that supports that portfolio. can you remind us how will you bleed that capital back in -- releasing it back in -- or just releasing it, i should say? i know when the 8.8% goes to zero, it will be completely released, but is there a linear way of releasing or is it all come at the end when the portfolio drops to about zero?",1,2025
1,9,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so, i appreciate the question, gerard. and look, as we have been selling down that portfolio over time, we do free up capital and we have been returning a lot of that to shareholders. so we don't need to wait till the end of the sell-down exercise to release that capital. in fact, you should expect that it will be part of our capital management plan over the following quarters. and as we have this broader discussion around quantums and capacity to continue to return capital to shareholders, that is one of the drivers that will have us continuing to look to do that.",1,2025
2,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," very good. and then coming back, david, you've mentioned it a few times in your prepared remarks, but also in answering questions. goldman is in a very unique position having this global view of the world because of your size and your presence. can you give us any color on, with the uncertainties going forward, is -- are they more elevated here in the united states than when you talk to clients in europe or asia? if you had to live the land, where is the greatest uncertainty or the greatest worry when you talk to ceos around the world?",1,2025
3,9,David Solomon,answer,answer," gerard, i mean it's a good question. and i would say the level of uncertainty is up signiﬁcantly , and it's partially up because growth was slowing down before we got to the implementation of trade policy . and the implementation of trade policy reset the prospect of forward growth pretty signiﬁcantly all over the world. i would say that when you get outside of us and i listen to ceos, i hear a greater sense of short- term concern, but everyone would like less uncertainty and more clarity on forward policy , and that's what we're hearing from clients. they want to understand where the policy will settle out, so that they can make capital decisions, investment decisions, planning decisions when you're talking to ceos. when you're talking to investors, investors invest by predicting the future. and they'd obviously like less uncertainty so they can have a better window into predicting the future. my guess is over time, this level of uncertainty will come down. and my general message to people is to go slow and take a pause here until we have more clarity around a lot of these issues.",1,2025
0,10,Jim Mitchell,question,question," hey, good morning. w e've seen very strong results in equities across the industry at or near record levels. but the industry performance in ficc has been a lot more muted. in your opinion, is that ficc-- is that the ficc is already operating at a high level? or do you see opportunities for aspects of that business to improve from here? just trying to frame the outlook on ficc.",1,2025
1,10,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," i think you've seen the most notable sort of period-on-period growth across the equity line, particularly equity intermediation type activities. ficc obviously is not a uniform asset class, has multiple subcomponents to it, and you can have dif ferent sort of behavioral patterns across the subcomponents of ficc. but the ficc business and the ficc markets are absolutely enormous. the clients that participate across the components of ficc are some of the largest clients in the world. w e expect there continue to be good opportunities to drive activity with clients across both ficc and equities.",1,2025
2,10,David Solomon,answer,answer," and i'd also just caution you, jim, we had an extraordinary ﬁrst quarter in 2024. when you look at year-over-year comparisons, and by the way , not a there's a lot of activity in the ﬁrst quarter of 2024, year-over-year comparisons sometimes can cloud. when you look at the growth in assets and resources over the last ﬁve years against the ficc business, the growth has been pretty meaningful.",1,2025
3,10,Jim Mitchell,question,question," sure. yeah. no, i appreciate that. but just maybe thinking through what areas might be underperforming right now , if any , that could improve in a better environment versus just maybe the dif ferent components, which are doing well and which are doing -- or underperforming, if possible?",1,2025
4,10,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, i mean, it wouldn't surprise you, yeah, it will surprise you, for example, that there's enormous activity in volumes in currencies at the moment, given this shift that people are thinking about and looking at the dollar and selectivity levels there are extraordinarily high, record activity levels. one of the things that, again, i just highlight about these businesses, these are big, broad, deep, diverse global businesses, and one level can be -- one lever can be up, one lever could be down. but when you look at the performance over a period of time, when you look at that market's performance over the last ﬁve or six years, it's relatively steady with a little bit of growth.",1,2025
0,11,Saul Martinez,question,question," hi, good morning. thank you for taking my question. i hate to beat a dead horse here on capital, but i did want to follow up on betsy and matt's questions, and what they mean for r wa progression? r wa is up slightly this quarter . your peers had much bigger increases. markets r wa is down, v ar is down. if i look at r wa density on a standardized basis, it came down quite a bit. it's at its lowest level i think that i can see in recent history . so just is there anything unusual in terms of r wa progression or v ars or exposures? and how do we just rethink about r wa density and r wa progression from here because obviously it does matter in terms of forecasting cet1 ratios and the level of excess capital over time?",1,2025
1,11,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so, again, you're not beating a dead horse, but i think what we would say is we look at that very , very carefully . when we set our own business planning, we use our own form of r wa projections, we think about our own capacity to step in and support client activities. and we are meaningfully focused on those exposures that have high density versus low density . you can see us sort of moving out of certain exposures that have high capital density . best example would be some of the historical principal investments. and we are feeding other activities, i can stay in the same segment for the moment like private wealth lending, which have a lower capital density and have an attractive recurring revenue component to them and also brings forth other types of activities with those clients. so we look across the entirety of the ﬁrm. w e look across each and every segment. and we look at which of our client base activities are more or less capital consumptive and we try and make sure that we're supporting the clients with the products that they demand from us and doing it as a capital- efﬁcient fashion as we can.",1,2025
2,11,Saul Martinez,question,question," okay . that's helpful. maybe just a follow-up with a very ticky-tacky question on tax rate. i think you mentioned 21%. i think the previous guidance was 20%, if i'm not mistaken, despite this quarter being -- having it beneﬁted from some discrete items. but i guess, going forward, tax rate should be roughly in the 23% range for the rest of the year , if my math is right? i mean just any color on how to think about your tax rate going forward for the rest of the year? and what it looks like on a more normalized basis?",1,2025
3,11,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. our guidance, you take into account everything that we know about the ﬁrst quarter and our outlook for this year is that you should expect the tax rate around 21% for the full year .",1,2025
0,12,Dan Fannon,question,question," thanks. good morning. just a follow-up on the outlook for the fee rate within asset and w ealth. you talked about the ocio wins and obviously , you continue to grow in bulk. so as you think about it on a longer-term basis, should this mix shift to be higher? or do you think those will of fset each other? then also in the quarter , were there any placement fees in the context of the management fee as you reported it?",1,2025
1,12,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. a couple of things. w e did comment that placement fees were down sequentially versus the fourth quarter . that was one of the components in the other fee line. to take a step back, you have an aggregation represented in the ef fective fee of the alts business, but we don't manage the business to the average ef fective fee. w e actually have multiple dif ferent strategies, and we have demand from different client subcomponents for those strategies. and so we're focused on building our dif ferent fund strategies in response to client demand, but not necessarily trying to boil it all down to one ef fective fee.",1,2025
2,12,Dan Fannon,question,question, understood. thank you.,1,2025
0,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question, hi. thanks very much. so i wanted to get a mark-to-market. you've been rightfully cautious but optimistic on green shoots becoming reality in investment banking. you deﬁnitely saw some momentum in the fourth quarter . so curious -- and you mentioned that the pipeline is up quarter-on-quarter . so maybe just dif ferentiate between what you're seeing on the corporate side versus sponsor side and just get the mark-to-market on how you're feeling. thanks.,4,2023
1,0,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. sure, glenn. i mean, just at a base level, i'm pretty optimistic, given the way we've got the ﬁrm positioned. and there's no question that these capital markets and m&a  activity levels have been depressed. as i've said before, i don't think that continues year-on-year-on year , and we really started to see, in the second half of this year , real improvement. as denis highlighted, the m&a  backlog saw a really strong replenishment and improvement in the fourth quarter . and i'd just highlight, and i know this is obvious, but i think it's worth stating, we put up $1 billion of m&a revenue. if the backlog is growing, that means we've got to replace the $1 billion that we put up, plus then have growth. and so, that's a very , very strong replenishment. and i would just say the level of strategic dialogue has deﬁnitely increased and we're seeing it across our platform. i'm encouraged by capital markets activity . i'm not going to say , it's running back to 10-year averages right away , but it has materially improved. i do think you're going to see some more meaningful ipos in 2024. and we are just, across debt and equity issuance, seeing more activity , more engagement. at the end of the day , people had done a lot of funding that takes them out for a period of time, but they've got to start thinking about their capital structures and accept the reality of the market, and we're seeing that come through. so when i look broadly , it feels better . there's a lot going on in the world. and so i think one of our jobs is to always be a risk manager and worry 98% of the time about the 2% of things that can go wrong. so we're going to continue to take a cautious view in terms of the overall operation of the ﬁrm, but i do think the ﬁrm is incredibly well-levered to this pickup, and it feels better is the way i'd frame it.",4,2023
2,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," all right. cool. maybe just to follow-up on that note. reducing the on-balance sheet investments, as you mentioned, is an important part of the roe improvement for asset & w ealth and for goldman overall. so with that said, the markets are higher , pipeline's better . how come the balance sheet reduction of on-balance sheet investments might be slower this year when the intent, i think, is to get rid of all of it at the right price?",4,2023
3,0,David Solomon,answer,answer," yeah, ﬁrst of all, i think we made a lot of progress last year . and so if you look at what we accomplished, i think what we accomplished last year was pretty meaningful, especially given the environment. one of the things that happened is we pulled some stuf f forward that we didn't expect to monetize in 2023 -- into 2023. and so to be clear , our focus is to get that to zero as quickly as possible. if you're operating inside this ﬁrm and you're operating in that business, you feel enormous focus on reducing that as quickly as possible. but we want to make sure that we manage expectations appropriately . we set a clear target over the next three years to get to zero. my guess is, we've got a good shot if we executed doing that quicker than that.",4,2023
4,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," fair enough. all right, thanks, david.",4,2023
5,0,David Solomon,answer,answer, yeah.,4,2023
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," hey, good morning.",4,2023
1,1,David Solomon,answer,answer, good morning.,4,2023
2,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," i just wanted to spend some time on the ficc business. so if i'm looking at the right numbers, it feels like ficc revenues are now back to pre-covid levels if you go back to 1q of '19. maybe if you can unpack it, just looking at slide 13, seemed like most products were quite weak. give us some perspective around does both -- the intermediation piece of ficc, does that feel like we are close to trough, and unlike seasonality , we should see some improvement in ficc from here, if you can just provide some perspective there.",4,2023
3,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. i mean, at a high level, what i would say , this quarter , intermediation activity was quiet, and particularly in the back half of the quarter , kind of late november and december , clients were quiet. if you look at the whole year , i don't think it's fair , i don't have the numbers in front of me, but i don't think it's fair to say the whole year is back to '19 levels. the overall activity levels were up and down during the year . we have a big diversiﬁed business. when our clients are active, we execute on it, we continue to grow the ﬁnancing revenues, which make it overall more durable. but it was a quiet quarter , particularly the back half, in terms of intermediation. i don't expect it to continue at that pace. i think denis' comments in the opening, we're seeing more activity in the ﬁrst few weeks of the year . but we'll watch it. and as you know , that activity , particularly in that segment, can move up and down based on what's going on in the macro environment.",4,2023
4,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," got it. and maybe just sticking to ficc or maybe both ficc and equity . on the ﬁnancing side, if you don't mind reminding us of the opportunity to grow ﬁnancing over the next year or over the medium-term. thank you.",4,2023
5,1,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so, thanks, ebrahim. so we've been clear over the last several years that we see opportunities to grow both ficc and equity ﬁnancing. and it's a virtuous activity for us. it dovetails well with our focus on clients and our focus on market share. w e have a lot of expertise in this space and we see a lot of demand from clients for us to deploy both into ficc and equities. w e now have leading equities franchise overall. our equities ﬁnancing business is in a leadership position and at scale. it has grown signiﬁcantly and we continue to see opportunities to increase the activities that we do with our existing clients and bring new clients on the platform. so we look out into 2024 and 2025. w e continue to be very focused. i think there's good opportunities across both ficc and equity ﬁnancing in gbm.",4,2023
6,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question, thank you.,4,2023
0,2,Brennan Hawken,question,question," sorry about that. thanks for taking my questions this morning. so just curious about the impact that we should be thinking about around the potential exit from the apple relationship. i know it's an ongoing thing, but maybe is there anything that you could provide that might help us think about how that impact could ﬂow through?",4,2023
1,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," denis said in his comments, we've got no other updates on the credit card partnerships other than what he stated. w e continue to work with apple on a partnership with them to serve our customers and to continue to reduce the drag from the partnership, and we continue to make good progress. and the drag in 2024 will be materially less.",4,2023
2,2,Brennan Hawken,question,question," okay . appreciate that. and then when you think about the deposit platform, marcus, that's been a pretty bright spot on the consumer front and deﬁnitely seems to have worked well. what has been your views or how has the beta on that deposit base played out versus your expectations? and do you have any plans to adjust your thoughts around, you know , earlier you talked about wanting to be in the top decile of payouts for that product. is that still the goal or has that adjusted as the platform has matured?",4,2023
3,2,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure, brennan, and thank you for that question. our marcus, deposit platform, has been a real strategic advantage to us in terms of overall ﬁrm-wide funding. w e did set out a strategy to set our pricing at the higher-end of the pricing envelope to maintain, sustain, and grow our balances across that platform. w e haven't adjusted our strategy at this point. w e saw good growth across our various strategic deposit funding channels last year , not just marcus. overall, deposits are up over $40 billion on the year . and i would just say , as we move into 2024, we continue to focus on driving growth across the strategic channels and be thoughtful about our overall funding mix.",4,2023
0,3,Mike Mayo,question,question," hey, david. you started of f the call saying that 2023 was the year of execution and that's the year when you had an roe of 8%, and if we throw in some of the charges, it's 10%, and that's not really executing at your 15% or so desired return. so can you give us a kind of waterfall chart in words on how you get from that core 10% roe to 15%, and if you could deﬁne medium-term?",4,2023
1,3,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. so i appreciate the question, mike, and obviously , we're very focused on it. it wasn't an a environment for our core business. in fact, i don't even think it was a b environment. when investment banking is operating at low levels, that is an impact overall. i do think that it's important to look at our core business of banking and markets, which is a very signiﬁcant portion of the ﬁrm and do note, on a fully allocated basis in this environment, which was not a b-plus or an a environment, given the investment banking activity , it had a 12% roe. w e continue to believe through the cycle that that business is a mid-teens business. and so i don't think we're going to see -- stay at the level of activities that we've been at. w e have that business positioned very well. and so you'll get some upside returns there in a better environment. and then secondarily , on asset & w ealth management, we continue to reduce the balance sheet. the balance sheet has been a drag on returns, but i think we've been pretty clear that we can drive the asset & w ealth management with a smaller balance sheet to mid-teens returns or better with a 25% margin. w e're on that journey . we're making progress. i think we'll make very good progress over the next two years. and if you look at those two businesses, that's the vast, vast majority of the ﬁrm, and i think they can operate mid-teens. w e've signiﬁcantly reduced the other drags. w e got a lot of it behind us in this year . that doesn't mean there won't be anything, but the drag from platforms in 2024 will be materially reduced from what it's been. and so i think we're making good progress in the medium-term is over the next couple of years, provided it's -- provided that it's a reasonable environment. and so i think you'll see good progress on the overall positioning of the ﬁrm over the next three to ﬁve years.",4,2023
2,3,Mike Mayo,question,question," and then just to follow-up that other drag, you said would be a lot less than 2024 from platform solutions. and can you dimension that a little bit? and also, as it relates to principal investments, do the higher stock markets help the disposition or not so much?",4,2023
3,3,David Solomon,answer,answer," they absolutely do. i mean, when markets improve, they help the disposition. there's no question. i also -- when you look at the last two years, we've had real headwinds in terms of revenue against the balance sheet that we could have more of that, but on a much smaller balance sheet in 2024. with a better market, you actually might have some beneﬁt to revenue performance, but we're focused on reducing that broadly . you see you have more transparency now in the platforms as we continue to close on greensky , move gm to held for sale. and so you have more transparency on that. w e think the drag will be signiﬁcantly reduced in 2024. when we're comfortable providing more speciﬁc color on that, we will provide it.",4,2023
4,3,Mike Mayo,question,question, all right. thank you.,4,2023
5,3,David Solomon,answer,answer, but small in the overall context of the ﬁrm and the ﬁrm's performance.,4,2023
6,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer, yeah.,4,2023
7,3,Mike Mayo,question,question, okay . thanks.,4,2023
8,3,David Solomon,answer,answer, thank you.,4,2023
0,4,Devin Ryan,question,question," thanks so much. morning, david and denis. question just on kind of interplay between a recovery in investment banking versus trading intermediation. and i know there's probably a lot of assumptions that need to go in here. but if you think about kind of the environment with macro conditions settling down, which would likely support investment banking, i'm assuming some areas of trading could also slow down and then maybe other areas could pick up as well. so just love to maybe hear a little bit about kind of the puts and takes, kind of what you've seen historically there, if easier . and just really kind of the key question is, just whether you can grow investment banking revenues and trading ex-ﬁnancing at the same time. thanks.",4,2023
1,4,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," yeah, so at a high level, devin, appreciate the question. i think we can continue to grow our ﬁnancing activity given the scale and the size of the market, the way market activity is growing, and we will normalize investment banking activity . and obviously , over time, given our position, and if you assume growth in the world, growth in market capital world, we will continue, as we have for the last 25, 35 years, grow our investment banking activity . when there's real disruption in the world, we ﬁnd that ficc can be a little bit countercyclical in some way , shape or form. but that's not the same as saying a normalization of investment banking activity means a slowdown in intermediation or market activity . i think there's a lot going on in the world. the trajectory of rates, there's a point of view on rates and inﬂation, but it's certainly not certain to me. i think people are going to be active as they adjust to the environment. there's debates about how the fed continues on its quantitative tightening or doesn't continue on its quantitative tightening. and so all of this, i think, will continue to play into people being active in markets. so i do think just at a high level, look, this is a high level. i think the environment in 2024 feels like it will be better for our mix of businesses than it was in 2023. but i'm not a good predictor , and we're prepared to operate whatever environment we have to operate in.",4,2023
2,4,Devin Ryan,question,question," understood. i appreciate that, david. maybe a quick follow up for denis. just commercial real estate, clearly big headwind in 2023. appreciate all the disclosure. their ofﬁce on-balance sheet is only $1 billion now . so when you think about just the environment relative to current marks, how do you feel about kind of the pain being behind the company and just characterize the environment where maybe there still could be material marks? and then just more broadly kind of expectations for marks as you exit the historical cre on-balance sheet principal investments. thanks.",4,2023
3,4,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure, devin. thank you. and as you know , we have new disclosure the last couple of quarters on cre in particular on the nature of the loans in that sector . and then as well as the on-balance sheet, both cre and ofﬁce in particular . you can obviously see from those disclosures, we've made substantial progress moving down the positions over the course of 2023, gave disclosure on the number of cie positions that we moved down recently , and we've made really signiﬁcant progress. w e disclosed on prior calls and our ofﬁce exposures from an impairment and marks perspective, we're sitting at roughly 50%. so we think that based on the visibility that we had and the activity that we had over the course of 2023 that that portfolio, and the broader portfolio for that matter , sits at the right place. as we move into 2024, there should be opportunities for further dispositions and we'll remain very focused on what the mix of that disposition activity is. when david was reviewing our expectations with respect to hpi sell-down on the forward, in addition to moving towards our medium-term target, we're also mindful of what the long-term franchise impact of those sell-down activities are. so just to give you a sense for why we may have cautioned on pace, we have some meaningful credit exposures where we enjoy a position of incumbency . and for the long-term beneﬁt of the franchise, we very much hope that we'll remain as a lender and a supporter of those clients to exit those positions in advance of a potential reﬁnancing would be to surrender our incumbency position. and so we're being thoughtful so that we can continue to reduce our risk while continuing to grow the third-party fund management business while supporting clients in the process.",4,2023
4,4,Devin Ryan,question,question, great. thanks so much.,4,2023
0,5,Ryan Kenny,question,question," hi. good morning and thanks for taking my question. so you highlighted in the prepared remarks that goldman surpassed your fundraising target in alternatives. and so as we look forward, can you give some more color on your strategy to grow , particularly in private credit? any update on how big you expect to get in private credit, how it complements your dcm and wealth franchises, and maybe any risks that we should be thinking about would be helpful? thanks.",4,2023
1,5,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. appreciate the question. it's, obviously , something, ryan, we're very , very focused on. w e feel good about the fundraising progress we've made. i think when you look forward in 2024, you could expect us to raise another $40 billion to $50 billion of alternatives. w e're, obviously , very focused on private credit. w e do operate at scale on private credit. w e have over $1 10 billion of private credit. but i think the opportunity for us to continue to grow and scale on private credit, especially given the way our franchise is positioned and the origination connection we have with our broad banking business gives us a unique platform and a unique competitive advantage. so we're going to continue to keep this focus. it doesn't stop because we met our goal. our goal was meant to ﬂame the opportunity set three-and-a-half years ago, but you'll see us continue to raise money on a year-to-year basis. and we've got some big funds that we're going to be in the market with in 2024, and we'll continue to build the partnerships with that client base. and both myself, john w aldron, and the broad team across our asset management division are spending a lot of time with the big capital allocators all over the world and continuing to invest in those relationships.",4,2023
2,5,Ryan Kenny,question,question," and then basel endgame comment letters are due today . so now that you and other gsibs have had time to digest the proposal, could you give us an update on how goldman might plan to adapt if the potential ﬁnal rule comes through and how the proposal is written might impact your 15% to 17% through the cycle rotce target?",4,2023
3,5,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. w ell, obviously , today marks the end of the comment period, and what i would say, it's certainly not the end of the process. in fact, i would say , it's the end of the beginning of the process. and so we're moving into the next phase and continue to be highly engaged with regulators and the broad set of government stakeholders, given our signiﬁcant concern with the proposed rules. you'll see comment letters from us, from our peers. you'll also see many letters from end users, including pension funds, insurance companies, corporates who are particularly concerned about how this rule could af fect their access to capital and their ability to ensure and mitigate risks in their business. and i think this is really rooted in the fact that the magnitude of these proposed changes would be felt well beyond the banking industry , and also i think disadvantages the us from a competitive perspective. so to be clear , my view is the rule was not proposed appropriately and it should be withdrawn and reproposed. i don't think speculating on the impact of the rule as proposed, i think there's a pretty signiﬁcant view out there that the fed is listening carefully , they're taking in the feedback, and i don't think there's anyone that's looking at a base case that this is going to move forward as proposed. w e're very ﬂexible with our capital, as i've said before. if the rules put certain changes in place, we'll also adjust businesses or pricing in businesses and certain activity to adapt. i think to speculate as to how we'll talk about this once it's in place before we have any idea what the rule is going to look like is premature. but we've got a lot of capital ﬂexibility and we've proven over time we can be particularly nimble. and so we'll continue to focus.",4,2023
4,5,Ryan Kenny,question,question, great. thank you.,4,2023
0,6,Daniel Fannon,question,question," thanks. good morning. as you think about your efﬁciency targets, what's a reasonable level of growth for non-comp expenses as we, excluding, obviously , all the one-timers this year? and maybe what the areas of investment are or priorities when you think about 2024?",4,2023
1,6,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," thanks, dan. so the efﬁciency ratio is something we are laser focused on. w e continue to orient the ﬁrm to drive towards our 60% target. you mentioned the impact of selected items. if you take the impact over the course of 2023, the efﬁciency ratio would have been more like 65%. that's, obviously , not where we want it to be, but signiﬁcantly better than the fully reported number . we have a number of initiatives across the ﬁrm to get after our non-compensation expense. w e had a very structured process we implemented once we put out some of the efﬁciency targets at the end of last year , rigorously marking to market our business plan and our execution against it over the course of the year . there is a -- we have a ton of dif ferent categories. w e're in the process of reviewing each and every category of our non-compensation expense, benchmarking it, reviewing kpis, thinking about our processes, incentive structures, governance, things that we can do to continue to drive that expense as efﬁciently as possible. w e do see an impact of inﬂation across these activities, and it's for that reason, that we need to implement the types of processes to mitigate those impacts and manage it as closely as possible. i think as we look into 2024, if you take a look at the disclosure round selected items, we don't expect those types of activities to repeat, and we'll be very , very -- remain very , very focused on maintaining our overall non-comp expense spend. and the other component of the efﬁciency ratio is, obviously , compensation expense. you saw that over the course of this year , we maintained our pay for performance orientation with respect to how we size that, and you should expect the same on the forward into 2024, that is obviously a performance-based and variable component of our overall expense. there are also a number of other items within our expense base that are variable. our largest items, both compensation as well as transaction expenses, are variable. so we will have to see how the types of activities unfold into 2024 and what the mix of our activities are to, ultimately , determine where we land on an aggregate expense base and an efﬁciency ratio.",4,2023
2,6,Daniel Fannon,question,question," great. thank you. and follow-up on w ealth management, you disclosed 40% of the alternative inﬂows since 2019 have come from the wealth channel. curious if that was consistent throughout that time period and whether you view that level of contribution as sustainable. and also just the economics to goldman sachs, how it differs between that 40% in wealth and the 60% externally . how does that -- what's the dif ference in revenue?",4,2023
3,6,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, at a high level, that comment is -- looks over the past four years that we've grown our asset management business -- asset & w ealth management business, and it highlights in the alternative raising over that period, this initial period of investment, what the mix has been between wealth, the institutional client base or other channels like third-party wealth, retail, et cetera. when you look at our strategy , dan, we -- if you go back 20 years, most of our fundraising for these activities came from our private wealth channel and the percentage of the money we managed was much higher than 40% from private wealth. so as we continue to invest in broad institutional partnerships in the pension community , the sovereign wealth community areas where historically we had not raised a lot of alternative funding, that percentage of wealth funding will probably decrease, but i'm not going to speculate exactly where it will go. at scale, the economics associated with all these alternatives are extremely attractive. they're attractive in the private wealth channel and they're attractive in our institutional partnerships. but as i think you all know , they're not exactly identical. and people that allocate or enter a partnership with you and allocate $10 billion deﬁnitely have a dif ferent economic proposition than somebody that's giving you $50 million or $100 million. and that's been consistent in the business for a long, long time. so we're continuing to scale the business. w e have real margin targets in the business. i think we've got lots of opportunities and we're still in the early stages of using the platform of goldman sachs to cement and invest these broad distribution channels for the beneﬁt of our scaled asset & w ealth management platform. and i'm conﬁdent we'll continue to make good progress.",4,2023
4,6,Daniel Fannon,question,question, great. thank you.,4,2023
0,7,Matt O'Connor,question,question," good morning. there's, obviously , all the uncertainty on the capital rules as was discussed earlier . but just in the near-term, how do you think about capital allocation? you're, obviously , continuing to lean into ﬁnancing, which is capital- intensive, depending on how banking, and if banking comes back, that can consume capital. and then just touch on interest in bolt-on deals, and then obviously , anything on buybacks, which were pretty solid in '23. thank you.",4,2023
1,7,David Solomon,answer,answer," i'll start, and denis, might add some comments. w e've always said that when there's activity to support our clients, that's our primary focus on where we can allocate capital. w e've increased the amount of capital allocated to our franchise -- our client franchises over the course of the last ﬁve years. and i think one of the reasons why our big broad global banking & markets franchise has performed on a relative basis in dif ferent environments the way it's performed is we've been very , very focused on making sure we have the capital and the ﬁnancial resources to serve our client base well. where we see opportunities, we will continue to deploy capital there. that's in our broad capital planning program. w e do generate a lot of capital from earnings. and to the degree that we don't see opportunities to deploy it with our clients, we will return it to shareholders. at the moment, we're taking a more conservative posture around that, just given some of the uncertainty around basel iii endgame. although again, i think that's going to continue to evolve. and i also think we have a long track record of being very , very nimble with our ability to deploy . so we're going to continue to focus on making sure we've got the right resources to serve our clients. and as we generate capital, we have conﬁdence in our capital position that we'll return capital to shareholders. and we've been very focused, as you've seen, on growing the dividend, and we plan to continue to do that.",4,2023
2,7,Matt O'Connor,question,question," and then just separately following up on the exit of legacy on-balance sheet principal investment, is there an expense reduction opportunity as those investments and some of the infrastructure goes away over time?",4,2023
3,7,David Solomon,answer,answer," there is an operating leverage story , which is one of the reasons why the margin in our asset & w ealth management business will continue to improve. when we were running an on-balance sheet business with lots and lots and lots of on-balance sheet position, the number of people that you need to manage those positions and serve those positions, creates a business that's scaled dif ferently than a traditional fund management business that you would see on someone else's alternative platform. and so we're early in the journey . i'll just give a simple example. w e went out last year , a year-and-a-half ago, and raised our ﬁrst growth equity fund. w e used to do that business on-balance sheet. we have lots and lots of positions, and therefore, a very , very broad team to service that. w e raised our ﬁrst fund. you need a smaller team to manage that fund. but when you go and you raise your second fund, you don't need to increase the scale of the team. and so there's real operating leverage in that, and that's part of our margin improvement story in asset & w ealth management over time. so the answer is, yes. i don't want to overstate this because it's not a massive part of the story , but it is a place where we have some operating leverage and improvement as we continue to move from balance sheet into fund form.",4,2023
4,7,Matt O'Connor,question,question," okay , thank you for the color .",4,2023
0,8,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," good morning, david. good morning, dennis.",4,2023
1,8,Denis Coleman,answer,answer, good morning,4,2023
2,8,David Solomon,answer,answer," good morning, gerard.",4,2023
3,8,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," good morning. in your prepared remarks, david, you were talking about, i think it was slide ﬁve or six, but about the success in growing the relationships with those top 100 ficc and equity clients, and you identiﬁed that the ficc and equity ﬁnancing contributed to that success. and that's been a real hallmark for you guys over the last two or three years, the growth in that business. can you dig down for us and share with us what has attributed to the success? is it the capital you put into that business, the hiring of additional folks or people in the business, and as well as competition. has the competition been more challenged than some of your competitors at all? credit suisse, of course, is no longer around. but if you could just give us a little more color on what's driving that success?",4,2023
4,8,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure, gerard. at a high level, i'd point to a couple of things. but i'd start with the fact that that business is a scale business, and we happen to be in the privileged position of being one of a handful of ﬁrm that really does operate those businesses at scale. and i think that's just important as a baseline. but i think there are a handful of things that we've done well. first, one gs and our one gs ethos. if you go back historically , we operated these businesses much more in silos with much less coordination across broad client experience. and clients would come into the ﬁrm in different places and get dif ferent experiences. and we spent a lot of time, and this goes back to 2019 really , thinking about how do these clients experience the ﬁrm? and we went out, we talked to them, we listened to their feedback. they really wanted to deal with the ﬁrm as a partner , one partner . i think we've made through one gs and that ethos, real progress in dealing with these very large clients in this business in an integrated approach that's improved their experience. and because it's improved their experience, they feel more partner-like with us, and therefore, that's improved our wallet share. secondarily , we've become a much bigger ﬁnancer of their activities. and when you ﬁnance their activities, you get rewarded in other ways through the ecosystem. and number three, we've also tried to really take the same way we have with investment banking clients for a long view , a very long-term approach to transacting with them. they need our help sometimes with things that aren't that economically attractive. we want to be there. if you do that, you do that consistently , you wind up getting opportunities that are more attractive. and so i think those three things combined with our scale platform have really helped us. when we look at our wallet shares, we continue to spend a lot of time. john and i spend a lot of time, and denis, too, talking to these clients in addition to the people running the business, asking for their feedback. and as we take that feedback, we'll continue to make adjustments to make sure we can serve them with real excellence. and as you saw from the presentation that we put up, one of the things that we're really focused on is how our one gs operating ethos allows us to serve our clients with excellence and distinction. it's a big, big tenet of what we're trying to do.",4,2023
5,8,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," very good. and then i know you've talked about the pipelines and your comments about what we might be able to see in ecm and other areas this year . can you also give us a little ﬂavor on what parts of the -- since you're obviously a global force, what parts of the globe are you seeing the best potential? is it the americas, is it europe, or is it asia?",4,2023
6,8,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, it's scale. the americas is the biggest part of the activity level. and just given the resilience of the us economy , i think you've seen a material pick up there, proportionally that's broader than other places. but we are seeing more activity across europe, particularly strategic dialogue. i'd say , the one place where things are slower , obviously , is in asia with respect to china. and just given the nature of economic activity there, where things are positioned, that still seems slower , both on both the m&a  side and the capital market side. but those are comments that make it a high-level, gerard.",4,2023
7,8,Gerard Cassidy,question,question, thank you. always appreciate the insights. thank you.,4,2023
0,9,Steven Chubak,question,question," thanks. good morning, david. good morning, denis. so i wanted to ask a couple of questions about comp leverage and operating margins. and maybe just to start of f, denis, you noted the adjusted efﬁciency ratio set at 65% versus the reported ﬁgure in the mid-70s. when we try to adjust for various items, at least in the public disclosure, it looks like the core adjusted efﬁciency somewhere in the upper 60s. and i was hoping you can maybe just help us reconcile some of the dif ferent items to get down to that 65% ﬁgure and whether that's the appropriate jumping of f point that we should be thinking about as we look ahead to '24?",4,2023
1,9,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so, steven, i'd say , i think the 65% is a good jumping of f point for 2024. and as the business evolves from there, as i indicated on a prior question, we have to ultimately be mindful of the mix of the business that comes into the ﬁrm. certain of our activities attract dif ferent degrees of transaction-based and other expenses as we prosecute those activities. and so we'll have to be mindful of what the ultimate business mix looks like. w e'll have to be mindful, obviously , what the ultimate scale and magnitude of the activities is as we roll forward in 2024. i think on the compensation side of the equation, you noticed our disclosure, that was roughly ﬂat on a year-over-year basis. our revenues net of pcl  in the year were up 1%, and our compensation roughly ﬂat. we observed that we thought that the performance of our core businesses was solid and that we had a year of signiﬁcant execution activity , and we want to make sure that we're in a position that we have the talent in place to deliver for clients as we look forward into '24 with a bit more optimism for what types of activity we could see. in terms of trying to get a handle on the selected items and the degree of repeat potential, most of those are pretty discrete items associated with the exit of activities and the one-of f fdic special assessment. the one area we'll continue to manage carefully is on cies as we continue to manage down the balance sheet as we've discussed.",4,2023
2,9,Steven Chubak,question,question," that's great. and just for a follow-up relating to the comments you just made, denis, on comp leverage, speciﬁcally . it looks like the expectation is for revenues to grow about $4 billion this year for the street. the comp dollars are expected to increase only about $600 million. you do have a good track record of delivering incremental operating leverage or strong marginal margins. but i just wanted to get a sense, given you were alluding to the fact that you're going to pay for talent and you're going to compensate people appropriately that execute well on the platform, how we should be thinking about incremental comp leverage, is an 85% comp margin a realistic expectation given where the revenue growth is ultimately going to come from?",4,2023
3,9,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," steven, i'll make a comment. david wants to make another one as well. w e're very focused on driving operating leverage across the platform. w e're also focused on driving scale across the platform. and meanwhile, we're staying true to our mantra of pay-per-performance. it's what our people expect, and it's one of the things that enables us to attract such exceptional talent and deliver excellence for our clients. the ultimate compensation payout relative to the results in 2024 really are going to come down to what the ultimate mix of those activities are and what we feel is the appropriate amount of compensation to reﬂect the performance of the team being mindful of talent retention, service of clients as well as driving operating leverage and delivering results for shareholders.",4,2023
4,9,Steven Chubak,question,question, great. that's it for me. thanks for taking my questions.,4,2023
5,9,Denis Coleman,answer,answer, thank you.,4,2023
0,10,Mike Mayo,question,question," hi. i was just wondering what you're going to do about the lead independent director , who i guess is no longer on your board, bayo, i guess, his ﬁrm got purchased and now you need to get a new lead director . is that someone from the board currently , someone from outside goldman sachs, what type of person is the board looking for?",4,2023
1,10,David Solomon,answer,answer," so i appreciate the question, mike. as you highlight, at the end of last week, bayo sold his business to blackrock. bayo still is the lead director . that deal won't close until sometime in the third or fourth quarter . bayo is the lead director . we have a governance process in place. our board has met and at the appropriate time, we'll make announcement as to the transition. but at this point, other than the fact that because of the sale, it will create a transition. i have nothing more to say other than bayo is still the lead director , and we'll manage the transition in an orderly process and no surprises.",4,2023
2,10,Mike Mayo,question,question, okay . so what? you would consider people outside of goldman sachs currently for that or?,4,2023
3,10,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, we're always adding people to our board, mike. but i'm not going to make comments. i'm not going to make forward comments about our governance process and our board looks at this at the time that the board takes action. w e announced a clear transition. i'll be happy to answer questions and talk about it.",4,2023
4,10,Mike Mayo,question,question, all right. thank you.,4,2023
0,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," hi there. thanks very much. so i liked your forward leaning comments on the ibc pipeline and i think i heard you say the demand for committed acquisition ﬁnancing is high. does that infer anything about us being any closer to an inﬂection point in private equity-related m&a, sponsor-related m&a? and then how much of an advance think you have as being maybe the big -- the only big bank that has a full on private credit platform, obviously dcm platform and lending platform? thank you.",2,2024
1,0,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. good morning, glenn, and thanks for the question. w e're forward leaning in our comments, because we deﬁnitely see momentum pick up. but i just, again, want to highlight something that was deﬁnitely my part of the script. and i think dennis ampliﬁed, which were still despite the pickup, we're still operating at levels that are still signiﬁcantly below 10-year averages. and so for example, i think we've got kind of another 20% to go to get to 10-year averages on m&a. one of the reasons that m&a  activity , one of the reasons, not the only reason, but one of the reasons why m&a  activity is running below those averages is because sponsor activity is just starting to accelerate. and so i think, especially given the environment that we're in, that you're going to see over the next few quarters into 2025 kind of a reacceleration of that sponsor activity . we're seeing it in our dialogue with sponsors. and obviously , it's been way , way below the overall m&a  activity as kind of another 20% to get to 10-year averages, but sponsor has been running below that and we're starting to see that increase. now, as that increases, i just think the ﬁrm's incredibly well positioned, given the breadth of both our leading position. w e've been top kind of one, two, three in what i'll call leverage-ﬁnanced activity from a league table perspective and with the sponsor community , but we combine it with a very , very powerful direct lending private credit platform. and so i just think we're in a very , very interesting position. the size and the scope of the companies that are out there that have to be reﬁnanced, recapitalized, sold, changed hands, the sponsors continue to look, distribute proceeds to their limited partners, i think, bodes well over the course of the next three to ﬁve years. dif ferent environments, but the general trend will be more activity than we've seen in the last two, 2.5 years.",2,2024
2,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," i appreciate that. maybe one quickie follow-up on, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that - in your printed prepared remarks, that real estate gains helped drive the equity investment gains in the quarter? can you talk about how material it was and what drove real estate gains during the quarter? thanks.",2,2024
3,0,Dennis Coleman,answer,answer," sure, glenn, it's dennis. i think the important to take away from the year-over-year performance in the equity investment line is that in the prior year period, we actually had signiﬁcant markdowns as we were sort of an early mover in addressing some of the commercial real estate risk across our balance sheet. and the results that reﬂect in this most recent quarter do not have the same degree of markdowns as in the prior period. so that is, i think, a large explain of the delta.",2,2024
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," good morning. i just wanted to spend some time on capital, the post, the scb increase. one, maybe just from a business standpoint, if you could update us whether the capital requirement changes anything in terms of how the ﬁrm has been leaning into the ﬁnancing business. do you need to moderate the appetite there or business as usual? so one, how does it impact the business? and second, dennis, your comments on buybacks moderating, should we think more like 1q levels of buybacks going forward? thanks.",2,2024
1,1,Dennis Coleman,answer,answer," sure, ibrahim. so a couple of comments. i guess ﬁrst important to observe that the level of capital that we're operating with at the moment is reasonably consistent where we've been over the last several years. so we feel that at that level of capital and with the cushion that we have heading into the third quarter , which at 90 basis points is at the wider end of our historical operating range, we have lots of capacity both to continue to deploy into the client franchise. and with what we're seeing across the client franchise with backlog up signiﬁcantly , there could be attractive opportunities for us to deploy into the client franchise, whether that's new acquisition ﬁnancing as david was referencing, or ongoing support of our clients across the ﬁnancing businesses. w e have the capacity to do that, as well as to continue to invest in return of capital to shareholders. given the $3.5 billion number in the second quarter , we thought it was advisable to indicate we would be moderating our repurchases, but we still do have capital ﬂexibility . and based on what we see developed from the client franchise, we will make that assessment, we'll manage our capital to an appropriate buf fer, but we're still certainly in a position to continue to return capital to shareholders.",2,2024
2,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," got it. so assume no change in terms of how we're thinking about the ﬁnancing business. and just separately in terms of sponsor-led activity , we waited all year for things to pick up. is it a troubling sign that the sponsors are not able to monetize assets? does it speak to inﬂated valuations that they're carrying these assets on? just would love any context there, david, if you could? thank you.",2,2024
3,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. i mean, i appreciate that. i don't think it's troubling. i wouldn't use the word troubling. but i do think that there are places where sponsors hold assets and their ability to monetize them at the value that they currently hold them leads them to wait longer and keep the optionality to have that value compound. at the same point, there's pressure from lps to continue to turn over funds, especially longer-dated funds. and as they take that optionality to wait, the pressure just builds. and so i think we're starting to see a bit of an unlock and more of a forward perspective to start to move forward, accept the evaluation parameters, and move forward. but i just think this is natural cycle and you're going to see a pickup in that activity for sure. i'm just not smart enough to tell you exactly which quarter and how quickly , but we are going to go back to more normalized levels.",2,2024
4,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question, thank you.,2,2024
0,2,Betsy Graseck,question,question," hi, good morning.",2,2024
1,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," good morning, betsy .",2,2024
2,2,Betsy Graseck,question,question," hi, can you hear me okay? oh, okay . sorry , [multiple speakers] all right. w ell, thanks very much. i did just want to lean in on one question regarding how you're managing the expense line as we're going through this environment because, we've had this very nice pickup in revenues and comp ratio is going up a little bit, but i'm just wondering is this a signaling to hold for the rest of this year? or is this just a one-of f given that some of the puts and takes you mentioned on deal activity earlier on the call?",2,2024
3,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure, betsy . so if you look at year-to-date change in our reviews net of provision, that is tracking ahead of the year-to-date change in our compensation and beneﬁt expense. w e are sort of following the same protocol that we always do which is making our best estimate for what you know we expect to pay for on a full-year basis and doing that in a manner that reﬂects the performance of the ﬁrm, as well as the overall competitive market for talent. so based on what we see we think this is the appropriate place to accrue compensation, but we'll obviously monitor that closely as the balance of the year evolves.",2,2024
4,2,Betsy Graseck,question,question," okay and as we anticipate a continued pick up here in m&a, given everything you mentioned earlier , i would think that, that's positive operating leverage that should be coming your way . would you agree with that or do i have something wrong there? thanks.",2,2024
5,2,Dennis Coleman,answer,answer," no, so we are certainly hopeful that the business will continue to perform and that we will grow our revenues in line with what the current expectation is based on backlog. and we would love to generate incremental operating leverage if we perform in line with our expectations.",2,2024
6,2,Betsy Graseck,question,question, all right. thank you.,2,2024
0,3,Brennan Hawken,question,question," good morning. thanks for taking my questions. you ﬂagged, dennis, the record ﬁnancing revenue, which clearly shows momentum behind the business. and it would be my assumption that given rates have been more stable for quite some time now, it seems to reﬂect balance growth. so one, i want to conﬁrm that that's fair? and could you help us understand how we should be thinking about rate sensitivity as it seems as though maybe a few rate cuts might be on the horizon?",2,2024
1,3,Dennis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thank you, brendan. so we have been on a journey for several quarters and years in terms of committing ourselves to the growth of the more durable revenue streams within global banking and markets. w e have our human capital and underwriting infrastructure set up in place. w e have relationships with a large suite of clients that are frequent users of these products. the business is very diversiﬁed by sub-asset class, and it's a business that we are looking to grow on a disciplined basis. w e've had an opportunity to deploy capital in a manner that is generating attractive, risk-adjusted returns. that's something that we're going to remain mindful of. but we believe, given the breadth of that franchise, that we should be able to continue to support the secular growth that our clients are witnessing, even as various rate environments should moderate.",2,2024
2,3,Brennan Hawken,question,question," okay . and then next question is really sort of a follow on from betsy's line of questioning. so year-to-date you've got a 64% efﬁciency ratio. you know , when we take a step back and think about your targets and aspirations for that metric and an environment, consider an environment that seems to be improving steadily , you know , how should we be thinking about margins on incremental revenue? you know , could you help us understand how revenue growth will continue to drive improvement in that efﬁciency ratio?",2,2024
3,3,Dennis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so, thank you for that question and thank you for observing the improvement that we're seeing. obviously , our year-to-date efﬁciency ratio at 63.8% is nearly 10 points better on a year-over-year basis. still not at our target of 60%, but we are making progress. as we continue to grow our revenues, we should be able to deliver better and better efﬁciency . but ultimately , the type of revenues that we grow and the extent to which they attract variable or volume-based expenses is a contributing factor . but we do have visibility , for example, as we continue to move out of some of our cie exposures that we should be able to reduce some of the operating expenses associated with that. and we do have a very granular process internally , looking at each of our expense categories on a granular basis and trying to make structural improvements to drive efﬁciencies over time, while we at the same time look to drive top line revenues.",2,2024
0,4,Mike Mayo,question,question," hi. i'm just trying to reconcile all the positive comments with returns that are still quite below your target. i mean, you highlight revenue growth in global banking markets and wealth and asset management. you have record ﬁnancing for equities and fic combined. you're number one in m&a. you have record management fees and record assets under supervision. your efﬁciency has gone from 74% to 64%. increase your dividend by 9% to signal your conﬁdence, your cet1 ratios, 90 basis points above even the higher fed requirements. david, you start of f the call saying the results are solid, but then you look at the returns and you say 1 1% roe in the second quarter , that's not quite the 15% where you want it to be. so where's the disconnect from what you're generating in terms of returns and where you'd like to be? thanks.",2,2024
1,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes, thanks mike. appreciate the question. look, we're on a journey . and, you know , the way i look at it, our returns for the ﬁrst-half of the year at 12.8%. there are, you know , i think there are a couple of things, give gets in that. one, for sure, we still have a little bit of drag from the enterprise platforms which we're working through. and so that will come out. and at some point as we work through that, over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll continue to make progress on that for the returns in the ﬁrst- half of the year would be a little higher exit. and then on top of that, as we've said repeatedly on the call and have given a bunch of information, we're still operating meaningfully below 10-year averages in terms of investment banking activity . and i think that'll come back. i obviously can't predict. but if you look at the returns of the ﬁrm, we have materially uplifted the returns of the ﬁrm. and we're going to continue to focus on that. now the next step to the puzzle is our continued progress in awm. so you know and you can see the performance over the course of the last few years of global banking and markets, but we've said the awm, roe is not where it needs to be. you heard our comments about the fact that we've gotten the margin up to 23%, but the roe is still around 10%. w e think we can continue to grow the business. as we've said, high-single-digits, we can continue to improve the margin and ultimately bring up that awm, roe. and then you look across the ﬁrm and you have a stronger return proﬁle. so i think we're making good progress. w e didn't say and have not worked to do for sure. but we feel good about the progress.",2,2024
2,4,Mike Mayo,question,question, and i assume part of your expectation is a sort of multiplier ef fect when mergers really kick in. can you just describe what that multiplier ef fect could potentially look like based on pass cycles?,2,2024
3,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," what i would say is one of the things that should be a tailwind for further momentum in our business is a return to average levels. i'm not sitting here saying we're going to go back to periods of time where we went well above 10-year averages, but there's obviously , if we did get back to that period, and there will be some point in the future where we run above average too, and not just below average, we have a tailwind for that. but as a general matter , when there are more m&a  transactions, whether with ﬁnancial sponsors or big corporates, there is more ﬁnancing attached to that. people need to raise capital to ﬁnance those transactions. they need to reposition balance sheets. they need to manage risks through structured transactions. and so there's a multiplier ef fect as those activities increase. w e don't put a multiplier on it, but our whole ecosystem gets more active as transaction volumes increase on the m&a side.",2,2024
4,4,Mike Mayo,question,question," and then lastly , for your returns, the denominator is a big factor . how does that work with the fed? i know you can't say too much and regional people can disagree, but your whole point is that you've de-risked the balance sheet and the company and then here we have the fed saying that maybe you haven't done so. so how does this process work from here? will we hear results about the seb ahead, or is this something that's just behind closed doors?",2,2024
5,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," look, as a general matter , what i'd say , mike, as a general matter , we're supporters of stress testing. w e believe it's an important component of the fed's mandate to really ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system. however , we've maintained for some time that there are elements of this process that may be distracting from these goals of safety and soundness. the stress test process, as you just highlighted, is opaque. it lacks transparency . it contributes to excess volatility and the stress capital buf fer requirements, which obviously makes prudent capital management difﬁcult for us and all of our peers. w e don't believe that the results reﬂect the signiﬁcant changes we've made in our business. they're not in line with our own calculations, despite the fact that the scenarios are consistent year- over-year . now, despite all that, you know , we've got the capital ﬂexibility to serve our clients. we'll continue to work with that capital ﬂexibility and we'll also continue to engage around this process to ensure that over time we can drive the level of capital that we have to hold in our business mix down. but obviously we have more work to do given this result.",2,2024
6,4,Mike Mayo,question,question," all right, thank you.",2,2024
0,5,Steven Chubak,question,question," hi, good morning. so i wanted to start of f with a question. just want to start with a question on the consumer platform fees. they were down only modestly despite the absence of the green sky contribution. just wanted to better understand what drove the resiliency in consumer revenues, whether the quarterly run rate of $600 million is a reasonable jumping of f point as we look at the next quarter?",2,2024
1,5,Dennis Coleman,answer,answer," so, steve, thank you for the question. i mean on a sequential basis, they're down, but that's because we have the absence of the green sky contribution. there actually is growth across the card portfolio. i think you've seen that the level of growth has slowed as we have sort of implemented several rounds of underwriting adjustments to the card originations and so our expectation is that on the forward you know the period-over-period growth should be more muted.",2,2024
2,5,Steven Chubak,question,question," understood and maybe just one more clarifying question. i know there's been a lot asked about the seb. really just wanted to better understand, dennis, since you noted that you're running with 90 bps of cushion, which is actually above normal. just how you're handicapping the additional uncertainty related to basel iii endgame. there's certainly been some favorable momentum per the press reports and even some public comments from regulators? but just want to better understand, given the uncertainty around both the seb and basel iii endgame, where you're comfortable running on a cet1 basis over the near to medium term?",2,2024
3,5,Dennis Coleman,answer,answer," sure, thanks and i appreciate that question. i think obviously there's been a lot of changes, there's been some changes and expectations. and i think in highlighting that we are operating at the wider end of our range, it is to signal ﬂexibility . and certainly embedded in that is to address some of the uncertainty which does remain with respect to basel iii endgame, both the quantum and timing of its resolution. it sounds from some of powell's latest comments that, that may not be something that comes into ef fect until perhaps into 2025, but we are sort of maintaining a level of cushion that think is appropriate in light of what we know and we don't know about the future opportunity set for goldman sachs, but that buf fer is designed to support clients return capital shareholders, while maintaining a prudent buf fer with some of the lingering uncertainty with respect to future regulatory input.",2,2024
4,5,Steven Chubak,question,question, helpful color . thanks for taking my questions.,2,2024
5,5,Dennis Coleman,answer,answer, thank you.,2,2024
0,6,Devin Ryan,question,question," all right, great. good morning, david and dennis. a couple questions on awm progress. so the ﬁrst one is on the alts business speciﬁcally , and you're tracking obviously well ahead of the fundraising targets relative to when you set the $1 billion medium term target for annual incentive fees? and now with over $500 billion in alts aum and obviously growing, that would seem pretty conservative. so i appreciate there's a lot of work to do to generate the returns ahead here, but how should we think about the underlying assumptions for incentive fees in a more normal harvesting environment, just given the mixed shift and the growth that you're seeing in aum there?",2,2024
1,6,Dennis Coleman,answer,answer," so devin, i think it's a good question, and i think we share your expectation that, that's going to be a more meaningful contributor on the forward. w e laid it out as one of the building blocks at our investor day . the contribution coming through that line since then has been not as high as we have modeled from an internal medium to longer term perspective. w e do give good disclosure that the balance of unrealized incentive fees at the end of the last quarter were $3.8 billion, so you can make you know various assumptions as to what the timing of the recognition of those fees are they can obviously you know bounce around from time-to-time it is a granular you know vehicle-by-vehicle build-up, but you know given the current outlook and status of those funds that our best expectation of what level of fees could be coming through that line over the next several years. so i think it is an important incremental contributor and should be, you know , should help the return proﬁle of asset wealth management on the forward, couple that with the success that we're having with ongoing alts fundraising and that will help to feed future investments and funds, which in turn will generate some backlog of potential incentive fees above and beyond what's already in the unrealized disclosures.",2,2024
2,6,Devin Ryan,question,question," yes, okay , thanks, dennis. and then follow-up, this is also kind of connected, but at a recent conference, you highlighted the margin proﬁle of all the standalone businesses and asset and wealth management of public peers so kind of as a comparison and highlighted 35% plus for alts and some of the public ﬁrms we know are obviously well above that. so i appreciate you're running the awm segment is kind of one segment, but if alts does accelerate and we're looking at 60% of alts aum isn't even the fee earning yet, what does that mean for segment margins relative to kind of that mid-20% target, because you're already at 23% thus far in ‘24. so just trying to think about the incremental margins coming from the acceleration in growth, particularly from the alts segment as well?",2,2024
3,6,Dennis Coleman,answer,answer," so that's a good question, devin. i mean, it should be a signiﬁcant unlock for us, because despite the breadth and the longevity with which we've been running our alts businesses, there is signiﬁcant opportunity for us to actually improve the margin proﬁle of the alts activities in particular relative to the overall awm margin, particularly as we develop incremental scale by strategy . and so in addition to just overall growth in the segment, which should unlock margin improvements, actually within our portfolio of activities, the alts business, again, despite its current scale, presents a big opportunity for incremental margin contribution.",2,2024
4,6,Devin Ryan,question,question, great. thank you.,2,2024
0,7,Dan Fannon,question,question," thanks, good morning. in terms of your on-balance sheet investments, you continue to make progress in reducing that this quarter . can you talk about the outlook for this year or any line of sight in terms of exits that we can think about?",2,2024
1,7,Dennis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thank you. obviously , an ongoing commitment of ours to move down those on balance sheet exposures, also part of the equity and capital story and returns in the segment at $2.2 billion for the quarter , that was a decent reduction. w e obviously have a target out there to sell down the vast majority of that balance, which is now at $12.6 billion by the end of next year . but our expectation is that we will continue to chip away at it across both the third and the fourth quarter of this year and then on into 2025. there's really no change on our commitment to sell down the vast majority of that by the end of next year .",2,2024
2,7,Dan Fannon,question,question," understood. and as a follow-up, just within asset and wealth, particularly on the alts side, the fundraising target raised for the full-year given the success you've had. the private credit fund closing here in the ﬁrst-half was big. can you talk to some of the other strategies that have the potential to scale as you mentioned earlier and/or maybe are a little bit smaller that have really large or increasing momentum as you think about second-half, but also as we even into next year?",2,2024
3,7,Dennis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so, you know , obviously taking a step back, you're talking about the targets that we set, you know , once upon a time it was $150 billion, we moved it to $225 billion. it's now at $287 billion and with $36 billion raised through the ﬁrst-half and us expecting to surpass $50 billion, that means we should be north of $300 billion by the end of this year . and i think one of the things that we ﬁnd attractive about our platform is that we have opportunities to scale across multiple asset classes within alternatives, equity , credit, real estate, infrastructure. w e had notable fundraisings in private credit and real estate this quarter , but you can see contribution from other strategies like equity on the forward and a number of dif ferent strategies, both by asset class and by region. so we think we have a diversiﬁed opportunity set to continue to scale the alts platform.",2,2024
0,8,Matt O'Connor,question,question," good morning. i was wondering if you could just elaborate a bit on the competitive landscape speciﬁcally in banking and markets. i know it's always competitive, but some of the really big bank peers, you know , are leaning in who haven't been a few years ago. and all these regional banks that i cover are also realizing that they need broader cap and market capabilities. so you're obviously an industry leader in a lot of the areas across banking and markets. and i'm just wondering how you're seeing the competition impact you at this point?",2,2024
1,8,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure, matt, and i appreciate the question. i just say , you know , investment banking and the markets business, the trading business, they've always been competitive businesses. i think our integrated one gs approach is a very , very competitive offering. i mean, we can have debates, but it's, i think, one of the top two of ferings out there, depending on how you look at it what you look at. there's always going to be competition there are always going to be people that come in and make investments in niche areas, but broadly speaking you know we've had leading m&a share for 25-years. w e have leading share in capital raising for an equivalent period of time. w e've continued to invest in our debt franchises over the last more than decade. an then our trading businesses and our ability to intermediate risk i think have been second to none or viewed as second to none for a long, long time. and so the combination of our focus on serving our clients, making sure we're giving them the right resources, both human capital and ﬁnancial capital, to accomplish what they need to accomplish, the fact that we have global scale positions is very well. they'll always be competitors, but i like where our franchise sits. and i don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to continue to invest in it, strengthen it, and continue to have it operating as a leader in what's always been and will continue to be a very competitive business.",2,2024
2,8,Matt O'Connor,question,question," okay helpful, it's unagreed. and then just separately , i hate to ask you about activity levels and stuf f like that since the debate three, four weeks ago, but maybe i'll frame it. from your experience in presidential election periods like this, where there's maybe just more uncertainty than normal, like how do both institutional and corporate clients react? do they kind of say , well, let's wait and see the other side? is it just noise, because we've been going through it for some time here, but what are your thoughts on that? thank you.",2,2024
3,8,David Solomon,answer,answer," there are always exogenous factors that af fect corporate activity and institutional client activity . i don't have a crystal ball, so i can't see what the next 100 days leading up to our election will bring, but i think we're well positioned to serve our clients, regardless of the environment. and clients are very active at the moment, and i think they're probably going to continue to be active.",2,2024
4,8,Matt O'Connor,question,question, thank you.,2,2024
0,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," thank you. good morning, david. good morning, dennis. david, you said in your opening comments that you took the board out to silicon v alley and you were impressed with the artiﬁcial intelligence and what we could expect in the future and the opportunities for goldman to be able to ﬁnance some of the infrastructure needs that may come of that? can you share with us the artiﬁcial intelligence that you guys are implementing within goldman and how it's making you more productive, generating maybe greater revenues or even making it more efﬁcient?",2,2024
1,9,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure, i mean, at a high level, gerard, we as most companies around the world are focused on how you can create use cases that increase your productivity . and if you think about our business as a professional service ﬁrm, a people business, where we have lots of very , very highly productive people creating tools that allow them to focus their productivity on things that advance their ability to serve clients or interact in markets is a very , very powerful tool. so, you know we you know if you look and you think across the scale of our business i think you can think of lots of places where the capacity to use these tools to take work that's always been done on a more manual basis and allow the very smart people to do that work to focus their attention on clients are quite obvious. you can look at it in an area like the equity research area as every quarter . you're all analysts on the phone. there's lots of ways that these tools can leverage your capacity to spend more time with clients. you think about our investment banking business and the ability in our investment banking business to have what i'll call the factory of the business prepare information, thoughtful information for clients, the revolution's there. when you look at the data sets we have across the ﬁrm and our ability to get data and information to clients, so that they can make better decisions around the way they position in markets, that's another obvious use case. for our engineering stack and we have close to 1 1,000 engineers inside the ﬁrm, the ability to increase their coding productivity is meaningful. so those are a handful. there are others. w e have a broad group of people that are very focused on this. but again, i'd step back. w ell, this will increase our productivity . the thing that we're most excited about is all businesses are looking at these things and are looking at ways that it adapts and changes their business. and that will create more activity in a tailwind broadly for our businesses. people will need to make investment, they'll need ﬁnancing, they'll need to scale. and so we're excited about that broad opportunity .",2,2024
2,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," very good. and then as a follow-up, dennis, you talked about credit, and it was impressive that you didn't have any charge-of fs in the wholesale book. can you give us some color on what you're seeing there? it seems like there must be some improvement since obviously you didn't have any charge-of fs in the wholesale book?",2,2024
3,9,Dennis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thanks, gerard. as you observe, the charge-of f rate for us in the wholesale is approximately 0%. what we did see in this quarter was release, and we've been able to improve some of our models and be able as a consequence to release some of the provisions in the wholesale segment. so while that was a contributing beneﬁt to sort of call it the net pcl  of the quarter with consumer charge-of fs offset by that wholesale release, that's not necessarily something that we would expect to repeat each quarter in the future. and although we manage our credit and our wholesale risk very , very diligently and consistently , it is more likely the case that we will have some degree of impairments given our size and scale and representation in the business. but we're pleased that the overall credit performance in terms of charge- offs is about 0%.",2,2024
4,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question, thank you.,2,2024
0,10,Saul Martinez,question,question," hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question. just a follow-up on capital, i mean, it certainly is encouraging that your cet1 ratio rose 20 bps in a quarter where you bought back $3.5 billion of stock and you did have a -- i think, a $16 billion reduction in rwa as your presentation talks about credit r wa is falling this quarter? i guess, can you just give a little bit more color on what drove that reduction? and i guess more importantly , is there continued room for r wa optimization from here to help manage your capital levels?",2,2024
1,10,Dennis Coleman,answer,answer," sure, thanks, saul. i appreciate that question. capital optimization, r wa optimization, is something that we've been committed to for a very long period of time. on the quarter , there were reductions both in credit and market risk r was. drivers included less derivative exposure, reduced equity investment exposure and in some places lower levels of volatility . we try to get the right balance between deploying on behalf of client activity , as well as being efﬁcient and rotating out of less productive activities or following through on our strategic plan to narrow focus and reduce balance sheet exposure. so that is something that was contributed to quarter-over-quarter beneﬁt despite the buyback activity we executed. and it's something we'll remain very focused on just given the multiplicity of binding constraints that we operate under .",2,2024
2,10,Saul Martinez,question,question," thank you, that's helpful. and maybe a follow-up on ﬁnancing, fic ﬁnancing up 37% equities, the equity ﬁnancing, now something close to 45% of all of your equity sales and trading revenues. i guess how much more room is there, or how should we think about sort of the size of the opportunity set, you know , to continue to grow from here? how much more space is there, you know , to use ﬁnding a thing as a mechanism to help deepen penetration with your top institutional clients?",2,2024
3,10,Dennis Coleman,answer,answer," that's a good question, saul. i think on the fic ﬁnancing side, as i indicated, we do think that we are helping clients participate in the overall level of growth that they're seeing in their businesses. and you know , we think based on what we see currently , that we can calibrate the extent of our growth based largely on how we assess the risk return opportunities that across the client portfolio. so we're being disciplined with respect to our growth, but trying also to support clients in their growth and drive a more durable characteristic across the gbm business. in equities, the activity and the balances, et cetera, obviously have beneﬁted from equity market inﬂation over the course of the year , but it's also an activity that we remain committed to in terms of supporting clients. and clients look to us on a holistic basis really across both fic and equities to ensure that across all of the activities they're doing with us that we're ﬁnding some balance between helping them through ﬁnancing activities, helping them with intermediation, helping them with human capital. so both of those activities are part of more interconnected activities with clients and something that we remain very focused on and think we can continue to grow .",2,2024
4,10,Saul Martinez,question,question," okay , great, thank you.",2,2024
0,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," hi, there. curious, you mentioned being optimistic about m&a  in the back-half, particularly on the strategic side. i'm curious what and how you -- what you're seeing that gives you that conﬁdence. obviously it must be conversations. and then what about the sponsor community? thanks.",1,2023
1,0,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. thanks, glenn. and so appreciate the question, and you're right. it has to do with dialogs and things that we can see. i'd say as we came into the new year , there's no questions dialogs have picked up. there's no question -- and i always talk about this when we talk about it broadly , conﬁdence af fects the ability for people to move forward to be active in the m&a  market and certainly what's gone on over the course of the last four weeks has slowed down some of the dialogs. but when you think about big strategic activity , i think most big companies continue to operate from a position where they're trying to make sure they have the scale and the strength competitively to advance their strategies. and so those strategic dialogs are quite active. and if you actually look over the course of the last week or two, there have been a handful of deals that have been announced that highlight that. we're seeing more dialogs like that and so we're hopeful that more of that will come to fruition. i just think that's a steady part of the diet. the companies need to continue to execute on to improve their strategic position. now, with respect to ﬁnancial sponsors, we're still going through a reset. i'm encouraged by the fact in the quarter , we saw one or two deals where kind of the bid offer between the value that a ﬁnancial sponsor could achieve and the ﬁnancing price came to a -- came to meet. there was a good data point and a sell-down of a legacy deal in the market, but i would say the ﬁnancial sponsor activity is still muted and there is more upside as the reset on both value and ﬁnancing cost continues. i think we're going to get there. i'd expect more in the second half of the year unless there was a really strong, a much more pronounced economic disruption because it just takes time for people to reset. w e've now kind of gone through ﬁve quarters of reset. and so generally speaking, historically , you kind of see these things turn on after four to six quarters. so i would just expect more of a base level of activity from what's been very , very muted.",1,2023
2,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," appreciate that. and building on that, your comment about companies wanting to build on their strategic position, maybe we could talk a little bit about your transaction banking platform because it's still growing. i'm just curious on the march events that we saw , did it cause any rethinking or maybe encouragement in terms of the direction of what you're doing with transaction banking and taking on those deposits? and did you notice any -- was there any noticeable behavior of how those deposits acted during the march crisis? thanks.",1,2023
3,0,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," glenn, it's denis. thanks for the question. i'd say that our conviction around the transaction banking business remains very , very strong. i think what we were able to observe in the ﬁrst quarter , i highlighted in my script and it's something that we're focused on strategically , is, we grew the client count by about 20% in the quarter , which is a similar amount to all of last year . and we're very , very focused on continuing to improve our position with our clients, of fer them more and more services and grow this business steadily over the long-term to create value. i think in terms of how the deposits themselves performed over the course of the quarter , they were in line with our expectations, and as we indicated, they ended on a quarter-over-quarter basis up just about $1 billion.",1,2023
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," hi, good morning. i guess two questions. one, david, you referred to the hyper volatility in the rates market, but would appreciate if you can address just ﬁxed- income trading, what happened there this quarter . clearly there was some lagged performance versus peers. to the extent you can, just give us a ﬂavor of what happened and your expectations around how things evolve from here, how are clients' macro funds holding up in face of this volatility .",1,2023
1,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. so i appreciate the question. i mean, it's been interesting -- this morning just watching what i'd highlight is, i think we had a very solid quarter in ficc. w e had nearly a $4 billion quarter . and just to put that in perspective, i think that's a top- decile quarter for that. i think we've had -- i think it was the eighth best quarter on record. i think we've got 96 quarters. so it was a solid performance and just the headline number of $4 billion, the way we look at it, that's a very solid ficc quarter . it was certainly a quarter there was volatility in client activity throughout the quarter , and i think we were well positioned to serve our clients and served our clients well. now, some of the noise that i see just from the early morning release, our ficc business was down versus the ﬁrst quarter of last year by 17%, but in the ﬁrst quarter of last year , we had signiﬁcant outperformance. if i remember correctly , our ficc revenues in the ﬁrst quarter of last year were up year-over-year 21% when the competitor average was kind of ﬂat or down. and you can go look at that from a base perspective. w e had much more signiﬁcant outperformance in the ﬁrst quarter of 2022 because of our commodities business and the breadth of our commodities business. so if you remember back in the ﬁrst quarter of 2022, the war with ukraine started, there was more volatility in commodities and clients were very active in commodities. and so it was an outsized quarter in commodities in the ﬁrst quarter of 2022. but overall, i think ficc performance in the quarter was strong. w e were there to serve our clients. and by any standards, it was a good quarter . i think given the environment that we're operating in, i would expect activity to continue to be active with our clients. it's certainly an uncertain period of time and there's a lot of movement and positioning, and so we're ﬁnding our clients active at the moment.",1,2023
2,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," got it. thanks for that. and then just separately , i guess, a big focus post investor day was picking up pace on asset sales. how does the environment over the last month inﬂuence that? equity markets obviously held up pretty well ex the ﬁnancials. so given the sense of just asset sale pace of that, how you're thinking about that and any change today versus investor day and how does that translate into pace of buybacks maybe in the back half of the year?",1,2023
3,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. so we commented in the script about the fact that we made more progress on the disposition of our historical principal investments, and we highlighted that we reduced them from just under $30 billion to just over $27 billion during the quarter . then it's also highlighted in the script that we feel on track to get to the $15 billion target number that we laid out over the course of the next 24 months. we feel good about that progress and we're going to continue to move to reduce that to zero over time. there are a lot of positions. there's no question when there are market headwinds, some of that might go a little bit slower , but we're on pace with what we're trying to do and are committed to it. and obviously , we see a big change in that business as we grow management fees and we take the legacy investments out, the volatility in that business, we believe, will change meaningfully .",1,2023
0,2,Christian Bolu,question,question," good morning, david and denis. just to follow up on the question on the markets business, march did feel like a very tough month for some of your institutional clients, particularly saw hedge fund closures, we are hearing of deleveraging. so how does that inform your view of the outlook for the trading businesses and your market share, particularly given, i guess, goldman's exposure to the hedge fund community?",1,2023
1,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," so i appreciate that question. w e're obviously very focused on share and our share gains. w e do participate with the hedge fund community , but when you look at our big competitors, they participate very actively with the hedge fund community too. we also are very signiﬁcant with the broad institutional community . as i said just in the previous question, our clients are active at the moment because there's a lot going on. w e're very focused on our market share. as we said in our investor day , we laid out more metrics and more of a focus on continuing to look at where we can advance our position with the top 100 clients that we deal with in our markets business. w e continue to be optimistic about our share position, our overall ability to serve our clients, and we do think in this environment, clients will continue to be active.",1,2023
2,2,Christian Bolu,question,question," great. thank you. and then maybe a question on capital return. can you just clarify why you are slowing buybacks? your capital ratio is seen very healthy to your point that the stock is attractive at this level. so not sure that i get it. and then any comments on your appetite for strategic acquisitions here? there's been a lot of stress in the wealth management space, which is a space i know you guys are interested in. so curious here, if you're conserving capital to go on the of fense.",1,2023
3,2,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. christian, it's denis. thank you for the question around capital. and obviously , in this case, appreciating the starting point in q1, where we signiﬁcantly increased the amount of buyback activity in q1. w e remain very committed to return of capital to shareholders, committed to sustainably growing our dividend, committing to the overall capital return proﬁle, but we're also observing opportunities to deploy into the franchise on behalf of clients. and there are elements of uncertainty in the overall macroeconomic environment. and so our expectations is that buyback activity will be moderated, but we'll monitor that over the course of the quarter . as you say , we do like the stock price and remain committed to return of capital to shareholders.",1,2023
0,3,Steven Chubak,question,question," hi, good morning.",1,2023
1,3,David Solomon,answer,answer, good morning.,1,2023
2,3,Steven Chubak,question,question," so i wanted to start of f with a question on platform solutions. the business saw a step up in expense. i just wanted to understand how we should be thinking about the trajectory for expenses in the segment. and similarly , for provision going forward, just following this quarter's signiﬁcant reserve release, we know you had accrued reserves pretty conservatively for that segment, but the top line momentum's good. it would just be helpful to get some perspective on how we should think about both the expense as well as the credit trajectory from here.",1,2023
3,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thanks. in terms of the overall trajectory for the segment, i think we have to step back. our number one focus is driving towards proﬁtability . we also mentioned that we look to continue to improve the efﬁciency ratio. that's certainly over the course of a period of time. maybe not every given quarter , but we remain committed to what we outlined. as you say , we've seen good top line performance of the business. and on the reserve release, it was a function of owning our point-of-sale business for some period of time, been able to observe it, take in more data. and greensky is actually performing better than we had modeled. and so that was a contributor to the reserve release in the segment. as we think about it on a go-forward basis, it's obviously going to be a function of origination activities across the platform. w e now have a reserve level of roughly 13% in the consumer space. so that can give you a sense of how to model provisions based on forward origination activity .",1,2023
4,3,Steven Chubak,question,question," that's great, denis. and just for my follow-up on expense and maybe more like a ticky tack modeling question, the expenses were a bit higher than expectations, but i recall you noted at investor day the need to absorb some severance charges. you also had some pretty outsized impairments related to cie portfolio. w as hoping you can maybe help us quantify the level of one-timers in the expense base this quarter just as we think about benchmarking versus some of your longer-term efﬁciency targets.",1,2023
5,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," thank you. thank you very much. so let me take that in pieces. in terms of -- on the compensation expense, any charges associated with severance and some of the actions that we took in the ﬁrst quarter are included within our overall comp accrual, which is a 30% -- 33% of our revenues net of provisions. that's embedded inside of that number . in terms of the change in non-compensation expenses, they were ﬂat on a quarter- over-quarter basis, but did include, as you know , $355 million of cie impairments. and so we thought it was important to call that out. and that also explains a bunch of the year-over-year delta between q1 '22 and q1 '23. that together with full quarter impact of nnip  helps explain the delta in that line for the ﬁrst quarter of this year .",1,2023
0,4,Betsy Graseck,question,question," hi, good morning.",1,2023
1,4,David Solomon,answer,answer, good morning.,1,2023
2,4,Betsy Graseck,question,question," so just a couple of quick questions here. one, on the consumer repositioning that you talked about today with the marcus loan sales and with your comments around greensky , would you say that as those are done and dusted, that would be it for the consumer repositioning?",1,2023
3,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," i think, betsy , what we said clearly is we're narrowing the focus. w e continue to be focused on our deposit platform and our credit card platform. i do think there are opportunities for us to do other interesting things strategically and how we think about operating it, but we're going to continue to examine all the things that we can do to make that as successful as possible. as i just highlighted, we don't think we're necessarily the best owner of greensky . so we're taking action on that, and then we'll continue to move forward to bring the consumer platform -- the card platforms to proﬁtability .",1,2023
4,4,Betsy Graseck,question,question, and so there's some nice capital release that comes from that. how should we anticipate you're going to be utilizing that as we look forward here?,1,2023
5,4,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so as we see the capital release from some of those activities, that just gives us incremental ﬂexibility with respect to how we ultimately deploy that either back in the franchise and/or returning that capital back to shareholders.",1,2023
0,5,Mike Mayo,question,question," hi, just a little bit more on the consumer repositioning strategy . how much in the marcus loans, i think there were $4.5 billion at year-end, did you sell? and what do you intend to do with the rest?",1,2023
1,5,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so we sold about $1 billion of the marcus loans and the balance has been moved to held-for-sale, and so we'll be looking at moving down that position over time.",1,2023
2,5,Mike Mayo,question,question," and so the marks that you took on these loans, what -- on what -- how much of those marks were in the $4.5 billion? w as it only a subset or the entire portfolio?",1,2023
3,5,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so we marked the entire -- we sold a portion of the portfolio, and then we marked the balance to market. and you'll see that reﬂected in the $470 million number moving through net revenues. and our reserve release was $440 million. if you think about the portfolio overall for the quarter , we generated incremental nii, and we had other net paydowns. so for the whole quarter , we generated revenues north of $150 million and it was proﬁtable for the quarter . as we move forward into the second quarter , we'll continue to generate net interest income on that portfolio and move down the balance of those exposures.",1,2023
0,6,Brennan Hawken,question,question," good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i'd like to follow up ﬁrst on a question that glenn asked about the transactional banking. in the past, in conversations, i believe that you've indicated that a lot of the competitors are the regional banks there. so i want to conﬁrm that that's the case. and then given some of the stress that we've seen and concerns around some of those providers, how are you adjusting your strategy in order to continue to build on the momentum that you seem to have shown here in the ﬁrst quarter? and if we see that continued stress, would you pursue inorganic venues to add scale or capabilities?",1,2023
1,6,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. so appreciate the question, brennan. the -- we think in transaction banking, we have a very good platform, a very good product. and the feedback that we're getting from clients about the product of fering, how it works, what it allows corporate treasuries and cfos to do is very positive. it's obviously attractive for us to take deposits, but we want deposits that are stickier and are here because people are operating on our platform. and so we're working hard to make sure, as we're adding clients, we're bringing the value that attaches the technology to what they're doing in a way that grows that platform. we are seeing positive results, but this takes time. these are long-cycle decisions. they're not day-to-day decisions on short-term trades. as denis highlighted, we had good momentum in terms of customer count where people added themselves to our platform. and so we're going to continue to focus on that. i do think, given the size and the strength of goldman sachs, as a g-sib and the way we're positioned, we're well positioned to compete with our clients for this business, coupled with the fact that we have an excellent product of fering. so we are going to stay focused on that and we expect the business to grow over time.",1,2023
2,6,Brennan Hawken,question,question," great. thanks for that color . appreciate it. and then for my follow-up, you all just announced this morning the new deposit arrangement with apple. and the yield on that is pretty close to marcus, a little above. how should we think about the economics of that apple relationship and the deposits speciﬁcally? and then how do you manage potential risk for cannibalization with your own marcus of fering? thanks.",1,2023
3,6,David Solomon,answer,answer," so thank you for the question. so obviously this is something that we launched yesterday that gives us another deposit channel. it's the opportunity for somebody that's a credit cardholder to put a deposit on. w e've obviously looked very closely at the overlap between who holds credit cards and who holds -- who has a marcus deposit and that overlap is small, but we'll obviously watch closely to see whether or not there is any cannibalization. but this is a way for us to try to open up another deposit channel and it's always good for us to broaden our deposit base. and so this is small at the moment and we'll watch it carefully , but i think it's an interesting opportunity for the ﬁrm.",1,2023
0,7,Devin Ryan,question,question," great. good morning, david, denis. i want to just touch on the equity ﬁnancing strength in the quarter . i know you kind of highlighted spreads and customer activity , but also appreciate this is an area of focus for the ﬁrm bigger picture. so just love to think about kind of where we're jumping of f of into the second quarter and whether the ﬁrst quarter beneﬁted from the market stress and that maybe you do syncretic things that happened during the quarter or if this is actually a reasonable kind of jumping of f point, and just maybe a better outlook for that business for the rest of the year.",1,2023
1,7,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. i appreciate that question. i'll give you some context to help you understand sort of the sequential activity and the direction. so our overall balances were a lot lower into the end of last year based on overall market levels and also as we reduced our footprint. and so as we came into the ﬁrst quarter , we were able to re- expand the capacity , clients engaged with us. w e saw an increase in balances, increase in client activities, increase in customer spreads. we've had in place for some time, a strategy to identify new types of clients that could come on to the platform and engage with us. and so i'd say that we're working sort of full speed ahead on that. w e continue to be very , very focused on this as one of the key priorities within the global banking & markets business.",1,2023
2,7,Devin Ryan,question,question," okay . thanks, denis. just a bigger picture follow-up here. so it feels like goldman generally takes market share during periods of stress. and so we just went through a pretty extreme period of stress in banking system and maybe we're getting on the other side of it, but perhaps not. and so with credit suisse now forcing an acquisition and capital likely becoming tighter in the banking system more broadly , are there new areas of maybe opportunity for goldman to take market share just in terms of where you're going to lean in with your balance sheet as you've done in the past? how should we think about maybe a couple of the top areas where you feel like you can maybe incrementally take market share just as a result of what happened over the last month or so?",1,2023
3,7,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, i think our core banking and markets franchise is incredibly well positioned. you can see the performance this quarter . i certainly wouldn't call it a top quartile for investment banking, traditional capital markets, ipos, m&a  activity . but with a 16.7% roe in our banking and markets segment, i think it's performing well. w e have the breadth, the footprint, the global franchise, i think, to continue to strengthen our share. and as i commented a little bit earlier , we continue to be focused on looking at our performance on the top 100, now expand to the top 150 clients and making sure that we're moving up and capturing share and serving them well. i do think, given some of the things that have gone on, there are other opportunities. i think one of the interesting opportunities is the private wealth opportunity over in europe. w e see lots of customers that had had accounts at both large swiss institutions with a consolidation. w e're certainly seeing opportunities in our private wealth business as people want to diversify the private wealth relationships we have. and so that's an area for share that we're focused on. so we continue to look across both global banking & markets and also asset & w ealth management for opportunities that we can strengthen our position and we think both franchises are very well positioned.",1,2023
0,8,Daniel Fannon,question,question," thanks. good morning. w anted to follow up on the third-party fundraising. you had another great quarter , but certainly highlighted that a bit slow this year , and i guess that's not surprising given the environment. but could you talk kind of longer term, as you think about maybe a rebound as the economic conditions pick up? and also, the cycling of your vintages of funds in terms of what could be coming on line this year that might result in continued strength or some pockets of slowness as you kind of go through that cycle?",1,2023
1,8,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so thanks a lot for the question. obviously , this remains a big area of strategic focus for us. with $14 billion raised in the ﬁrst quarter and now up to $193 billion, we feel very good about that. w e indicated that the pace could slow over the balance of the year, but we do have about 20 of ferings in market on diversiﬁed basis across asset classes where we're actively looking to raise funds. i think it's really the breadth and the diversity of our franchise that's going to enable us to continue to raise those types of assets. dif ferent strategies will play towards different types of environments and having the breadth of of fering, i think, is proving to be beneﬁcial. so even though we indicated it may slow later in this year , strong conviction that we'll be on pace for the total amount that we had indicated, just given what we see across our platform.",1,2023
2,8,David Solomon,answer,answer," and i'd just say , dan, that one of the things that happens in this business is as you scale and you have the breadth that we have in this business, we set a target for 2024, but there is a longer-term goal on target, and there's lots of room for us to grow and continue to expand our footprint and position given the of fering that we have across the broad alternative spectrum, the global nature of our platform. and so this is still -- these are long-dated fundraisings, long-cycle stuf f, but there is a lot of runway for us once we get past the 2024 target too.",1,2023
3,8,Daniel Fannon,question,question," thanks. and then just a follow-up, denis, on the expense side. the $1 billion of savings from realization of programs that you highlighted at investor day , what was realized in the ﬁrst quarter? or maybe just remind us on the pacing of some of those savings as we think about the range of this year?",1,2023
4,8,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so at investor day , we outlined that over the course of the year , we'd have run rate payroll expense of about $600 million and non-comp efﬁciency , about $400 million, and we see about half of that reﬂected in this year and the balance thereafter . i'd say we're on target for those initiatives and those efﬁciencies. and we continue to look at it, and we continue to see other opportunities to incrementally drive efﬁciency across our platform. one area we had focused on for quite some time was the overall level of professional fees. w e continue to grind that down. and if you look at some of the sequential components of our overall non-compensation expense, you'll see we're making good progress against most of the line items.",1,2023
0,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," good morning, david. good morning, denis.",1,2023
1,9,David Solomon,answer,answer, good morning.,1,2023
2,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," david, in your comments about your principal investments, you mentioned obviously market conditions will impact how quickly you get to your targeted goal of $15 billion by the end of '24. in those market conditions, is it more the ipo and ecm markets that have a bigger headwind for you in this area? or is it just general market levels and the activity we're seeing?",1,2023
3,9,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, i appreciate the question, gerard. and i think all these things contribute. financing availability contributes on certain assets; ipo market can contribute on certain assets, and just general valuations contribute on certain assets. i want to put the comments in perspective because i think that appropriately , we want to make sure people understand obviously that when there is a lot of volatility or there are tough markets, it might slow this down, but we laid out at our investor day a plan to move over the coming few years to close to zero on the historical principal investments. we continue to have a target to get to $15 billion by the end of 2024. w e're conﬁdent that we're going to execute on that target. so i think the way to think about this is we laid out a multi-year plan to reduce this down to close to zero and we're moving along on that target. i wouldn't take the comments that on any quarter-to-quarter basis, things can slow down. i wouldn't overstate that, but i want people to be aware that if the market or the environment turns more difﬁcult, that could potentially slow us down. but we're very focused on this, and we're going to continue to work to execute on a quarter-to-quarter basis.",1,2023
4,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," very good. and i know you guys touched on the share repurchases slowing it down a bit and here in the second quarter , you're very well capitalized. if market conditions -- i should ask, i guess, how important is it that the ﬁnancial markets need to stabilize for you guys to maybe get more aggressive in the second half of the year in buying back the stock?",1,2023
5,9,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," thanks for the question. look, i think it gets back to how we think about our overall capital allocation framework, and we're looking at opportunities to deploy against our client franchise where there could be opportunities for incremental deployment. given some of the disruption that we're seeing in markets, we want to remain mindful of that. w e want to remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, and so we're looking to strike the right balance while being mindful of the overall operating environment.",1,2023
6,9,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. i'd also -- i also just want to highlight, when we spoke at investor day , we said clearly that we are focused on accelerating buybacks. that is still in place. quarter- to-quarter may vary , but that is still in place. and so i just want that also kept in perspective too.",1,2023
0,10,James Mitchell,question,question," hi, good morning. i think you hinted at improved dialog levels in underwriting to start the quarter . so can you just give a little more color what you're seeing in the market and maybe how you see the ecm and dcm environment evolving, assuming we don't have another major step back in the macro?",1,2023
1,10,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. i think there have been some greenshoots. there were certainly some greenshoots in february . levels are still muted. there are obviously a number of things out there that we'd like to get done, and we're seeing some indication of some signiﬁcant transactions starting to prepare to get -- to move forward, given markets seem to have settled down a little bit. but i still think we're below trend level. as i said earlier in the conversation, history tells you that there is plenty of capital raising that needs to get done. generally speaking, people have to use the capital markets to execute on their strategies. but when you have these slowdowns or these windows close, they typically -- you get that rebalanced after four to six quarters. we're kind of ﬁve quarters in. and so my expectation or hope is we won't see improvements from what have been very muted levels, but at this point, we had a very volatile march, and i'd say things are still slow , but we are starting to see some more greenshoots again. and we'll just have to watch and see how things unfold in the quarter and into the back half of the year .",1,2023
2,10,James Mitchell,question,question," okay . that's helpful. and then maybe just on ficc ﬁnancing, i know that's been a focus of growth as well outside of -- equities saw a pretty strong improvement in spreads and volume, but it doesn't look like we saw that in ficc. anything to think about on the ficc side, on the ﬁnancing space and how you see that going forward?",1,2023
3,10,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. still very , very committed to the ficc ﬁnancing business, which, as we indicated, was up slightly year-over-year . there continue to be good opportunities to deploy on behalf of clients. i think a lot of the market share progress and client engagement progress that we made over the last couple of years sets us up as one of the go-to calls for the provision of ﬁnancing across the ficc space. so that, combined with the equity ﬁnancing, remain real priorities for our global banking & markets business. w e feel good about it.",1,2023
0,11,Jeremy Sigee,question,question," thank you. good morning. could i get you to talk a bit more about the credit suisse opportunity in wealth management? you mentioned europe, but could you also talk a bit about asia and latin america? are those regions where you as a ﬁrm have sufﬁcient strength in wealth management to take more share from the swiss banks since they are disrupted or is that a bit more marginal for you?",1,2023
1,11,David Solomon,answer,answer," on the second part of the question, i think when you look at latin america, it's more marginal for us, but there is -- we really do have a global footprint, and there are opportunities for us, especially as so many very wealthy individuals deal in dollars around the world. w e also have very , very strong latin american presence that comes into our presence in florida, obviously , where our private wealth business is focused on latin america. so there is opportunity there. we continue to have a broad private wealth footprint in asia. w e haven't been as focused on growth and investment in asia as we have been in europe over the course of the last couple of years. w e did launch a private wealth joint venture over in asia over the course of the last couple of months with icbc, which i think is a small and slow opportunity , but is an opportunity for us. i think the interesting thing is whenever there is consolidation, as we look at very wealthy individuals that are on our private wealth platform, they tend to have multiple providers. so whenever there is consolidation, there are opportunities to talk to people as people then rethink their footprint and the diversiﬁcation of their footprint. and so our private wealth teams are very focused on that and the way we serve those clients.",1,2023
2,11,Jeremy Sigee,question,question, that's very helpful. thank you.,1,2023
0,12,Andrew Lim,question,question," hi, good morning. so my ﬁrst question is about your focus on credit cards on the consumer side. perhaps you can talk more speciﬁcally about what you see as your competitive advantages there and how you think about sizing up in credit cards in this point of the cycle. it's perhaps arguably quite late and some would argue that credit card growth tends to be a reﬂection of individuals not being able to manage expenses in a high inﬂationary environment.",1,2023
1,12,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thanks. so as you know , we have our card platform business. w e've been building that over the next -- over the last several years. w e have partnership with general motors, a partnership with apple, and we've been steadily investing in those relationships and building our balances. as you indicate, given the overall environment, the total balances actually were down sequentially , just given seasonality and given some of our credit underwriting standards and origination volumes, but this is a business that we continue to invest in and believe it's an overall piece of the ﬁrm that is diversifying.",1,2023
2,12,Andrew Lim,question,question," great. okay . i've got a second question more broadly about the crisis that we saw in march and how you think about how it evolved and maybe the repo situation as well. so if we think about the svb situation, obviously , they decided to sell a lot of their assets below market value, and in the process, crystallizing a lot of those losses. and i guess in retrospect, it would have been a lot easier for them to repo those assets with the fed and avoid those mark-to-market losses. and i was just wondering if you could share your thoughts as to maybe why that didn't happen. it would have been obviously to af ford a lot of the crisis conﬁdence advice from that situation.",1,2023
3,12,David Solomon,answer,answer," i don't really have a -- i don't have a comment on that, andrew . there are a variety of factors in the actions that they took. ultimately , there was a bank run at svb and that led to the situation we are. but i don't -- i'm not going to go back and recount what decisions that management and that board made around that.",1,2023
0,13,Mike Mayo,question,question," hi. first, goldman speciﬁc and then general. the goldman speciﬁc is why now on the consumer repositioning, greensky sale and marcus loans? and then a more general question. to what degree did silicon v alley impact the capital markets and the advisory appetite out there? thanks.",1,2023
1,13,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. thanks, mike. so ﬁrst, why now , it's actually not why now . it's like -- it's why over the last 12 months is, as you know , we made a strategic decision kind of 12 months ago at this point to really narrow our consumer focus, and we've been executing on it. and it's not narrowing that focus and making those decisions and executing on it are not things that can be done instantaneously . so we've gone through a very , very thoughtful process and we're moving forward in the execution of that. again, i think these things also are just not like they're small in the overall scope of goldman sachs. the marcus loan portfolio was proﬁtable but small, wasn't strategic. greensky , as we highlighted today , we think it's a good business, good platform, and actually , as we watch it perform, it's performing well. but given the way we've narrowed our focus, not strategic for us. and so we're simply executing on the decisions that we laid out and we'll continue to do things that we think are right over time to deliver for our shareholders. on the second question, which is just what happened in march, how did it af fect capital markets and m&a, i think it has a ef fect. it was a highly -- as i highlighted in my comments, this kind of an unusual few-week period with really , really outsized volatility , and as you and i discussed before, whenever you have that kind of volatility , it slows down capital markets activity . so i thought we were starting to get a little bit more capital markets activity at the end of february . i noticed now equity markets seem to be behaving well, debt markets are behaving reasonably well. i can't say that there won't be some other event that creates stress. there certainly are other things on the horizon that you could see that could create volatility like the negotiation around the debt ceiling, just to point to an example, but i do think when you have that kind of volatility , it slows down or it has people push out things that they were thinking about bringing into the capital markets. so yes, [technical difﬁculty] quarter . it was certainly a pretty muted quarter for investment banking activity for us and for the market as a whole.",1,2023
0,14,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," thank you. just one quick question, denis, maybe. around the apple savings deposit, how do you intend to use the funds that come in? i appreciate early days in terms of the level of inﬂows that you may get on that product, but is that money just going to sit in cash earning fed funds? just trying to ﬁgure out what the nii revenue impact could be tied to those deposits.",1,2023
1,14,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. thanks. thanks, ebrahim. so across the ﬁrm, we have multiple funding channels, multiple sources that we tap in our bau activities. w e have multiple deposit channels that we also actively work with each and every day . we view this as one incremental and diversifying source of deposits, enables us to deepen our relationship with apple, tap into their ecosystem and the clients that we serve together who are cardholders and want to sort of take advantage of the ease of moving into a deposit account. and we'll take those deposits along with all the other deposits in our portfolio and deploy it into the client franchise.",1,2023
0,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," hi, thanks very much. i apologize if i missed it within your remarks, but can you tell us what the p&l  contribution from the $1 billion or so in dispositions out of the private equity book was? and i want to ask that in the context of when people see the marks on the private portfolio being pretty small relative to what happened in the public markets that they want to see why you have conﬁdence, what about the portfolio gives you such conﬁdence that it wasn’t as af fected by what’ s going on in the public markets? thanks so much.",2,2022
1,0,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," thanks, glenn. it’ s denis. let me take that for you. so, we made a number of remarks with respect to the composition of our on-balance sheet equity investments. and speciﬁcally , we made note of event-driven gains of approximately $380 million during the quarter . we noted a markdown of $100 million approximately across consumer and technology sectors. and what i would say to give you some context is we do look at the portfolio on a very , very granular basis. it’ s comprised of both corporate and real estate assets. and we look at the performance, for example, of our private equity names, their top line performance. on average, they are growing north of 20%. and if we were to take a look at some public comparable, albeit an imperfect one, those are growing in a negative fashion. and so it reﬂects the initial equity investment selection as well as the ongoing performance of those particular businesses.",2,2022
2,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," okay . very much appreciated. and then one quick follow-up, obviously , ecm and dcm pipelines are down a lot given what we have seen. but you noted that your advisory backlog is actually up. i wonder if you could expand on that a little bit, because we haven’t seen a lot of activity these days in m&a? thanks.",2,2022
3,0,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," what i would say in terms of the overall advisory performance, you can see the headline number , which is quite signiﬁcant at $1.2 billion. and we have our sustained number one market share position across both announced and completed actually increasing our lead versus certain other competitors. i think this is an environment where our clients are turning to us and looking for advice on how they can execute on what’ s particularly strategic for them. the nature of the transactions that they maybe considering could very well be dif ferent in their complexion than a year ago, but nevertheless, our robust global client base have strategic needs and they trust us to help them navigate the market. so, we do continue to see high levels of strategic dialogue and client engagement. there is no question if the overall operating environment were to deteriorate further or if conﬁdence were impaired, we could see some softening even in our advisory activities. but to-date, they have been strong. on the underwriting side, that’ s much more a reﬂection of the current capital markets’ receptivity , and again, strong levels of client engagement. w e like our backlog, but it is – there will be a better market environment required in order for many of our clients to choose to access those markets and for us to deliver on certain aspects of that backlog.",2,2022
4,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," thanks, denis.",2,2022
5,0,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," thanks, glenn.",2,2022
0,1,Christian Bolu,question,question," good morning, david and denis. so, you posted pretty strong results this morning. you are continuing to take market share in trading. roe year-to-date is 13%, just pretty good given the backdrop for me and you guys’  tone sounds very , very cautious. so what exactly are you worried about in the macro backdrop, maybe just more speciﬁcally? and how does that impact your thinking on timeline to achieve medium-term roe targets?",2,2022
1,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," i will start, christian. i don’t know if denis will add anything to it. i think our tone is cautious, because the environment is uncertain. the environment is very uncertain. we don’t have a crystal ball to tell you exactly how monetary policy will navigate the inﬂationary environment that exists, but there is no question that economic conditions are tightening to try to control inﬂation. and as economic conditions tighten, it will have a bigger impact on corporate conﬁdence and also consumer activity in the economy . i think it’ s hard to gauge exactly how that will play out. and so i think it’ s prudent for us to be cautious. now that said, i think one of the things you saw this quarter is we have a much broader , much more diverse, much more global, much more resilient business than we might have had 5, 7, 10 years ago, and we beneﬁted from that in the context of the quarter . so we feel good about our ability to operate. i would say that, at the moment, while there is a lot of uncertainty , clients are still relatively active. denis was just talking about m&a  activity , and our clients are active. capital markets activity is obviously down. this is not an environment where everyone is looking to shed all risk, but it’ s certainly an environment where people are more cautious about risk. so we continue to monitor it, but i think it’ s prudent and appropriate for us to be cautious. and if you go back and listen to some of the words, we said we’re evaluating things with respect to resources. w e’re being ﬂexible and being prepared to be nimble in case the environment gets worse. by the way , we don’t know that the environment is going to get worse. the environment might get better , too. so i just think it’ s a time where prudence and caution makes a lot of sense. now with respect to our targets, i want to be clear , we set medium-term targets for 2024, and we still plan on meeting those targets. and we don’t see anything in this environment that will prevent us from meeting those targets. i’m not going to speculate on a quarter-by-quarter basis as to what the trajectory looks along the way . but i would say in what’ s been certainly a very difﬁcult ﬁrst half of the year , if you think about the headwinds we’ve faced in both public equity markets because of the war in ukraine and the unwind of the business in russia, etcetera, i think there have been some exogenous events in this ﬁrst half of the year that certainly created bigger headwinds than we might see in other times going forward. so we remain comfortable and committed to our targets, and we will continue to move forward expeditiously to meet them.",2,2022
2,1,Christian Bolu,question,question," okay , thanks. maybe switch over to the consumer business. i wanted to get your latest thinking on that business. how is the proﬁtability curve tracking? how are you thinking about that business going into a downturn? and then just strategically , given the pressures on ﬁn-techs out there, i’m wondering if there is any sort of opportunity here to try and grow faster , either organically or inorganically .",2,2022
3,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. i appreciate the question. and i guess i’d just step back and i’d highlight that we’ve been building a business from scratch here. it certainly takes investment, and we’ve been making investment. and we’ve been pretty clear that we have a long- term strategy to create a leading digital platform in the consumer banking business. now we’ve been at it, as i think you know , for 5 years. w e’ve built out a really good deposit platform. w e built out an interesting cards platform with very interesting technology . we have a loans platform. w e have some technology around an invest platform, and we’ve also added greensky . with that portfolio of product of ferings, we’ve told you at our update that we expect greater than $4 billion of revenue in 2024. you can obviously see this quarter that we’re making progress on revenue in the business. and as we noted, i think when we spoke in february , at the update, we said the vast majority of the build cost associated with the products that will achieve that $4 billion target are in the ground. and so i’d remind you of that comment. on a year-to-date basis, the vast majority of the investment relates to building credit reserves as we grow the business. and just a reminder , cecl  requires very , very signiﬁcant upfront reserve build. so we continue to feel good about the progress we’re making, and we expect this business to generate accretive returns to goldman sachs over time. and we’re committed to the journey that we’ve set out on to make sure that we do just that over time.",2,2022
4,1,Christian Bolu,question,question," okay , thank you.",2,2022
5,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," i just – the one thing i realized, christian, that i didn’t touch on is we’re very , very focused on the credit box and thinking about the credit box during the early part of the pandemic. when there was enormous uncertainty , we tightened the credit box meaningfully . as denis highlighted in his opening remarks, we don’t see signiﬁcant indications of credit deterioration in the consumer . but given tightening economic conditions, we’re watching that very , very carefully . and to the degree that we saw different signals in the short-term, we would adjust our credit box very dynamically .",2,2022
6,1,Christian Bolu,question,question, thank you.,2,2022
0,2,Steven Chubak,question,question," hi, good morning, david. good morning, denis.",2,2022
1,2,David Solomon,answer,answer, good morning.,2,2022
2,2,Steven Chubak,question,question," so maybe just as a follow-up on the credit discussion, i was hoping you could speak to your appetite for loan growth. you noted that you could be very dynamic but just given some of the upward pressure on provision from both growth math as well as the macro deterioration. i was hoping you could just provide some ranges as to how we should be thinking about through-the-cycle provision expectation and a more normal operating backdrop?",2,2022
3,2,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," steven, thanks. it’ s denis. let me maybe provide a little extra color around the provisions just to help provide some context. so as we noted, with respect to the consumer portion, that’ s really driven by ongoing growth in the asset origination as opposed to deterioration of credit quality . and on the wholesale side, we obviously model the macroeconomic outlook. and when we do our work across our various scenarios, over the course of the ﬁrst quarter into the second quarter , our outlook for the forward is for a less robust set of macroeconomic variables from gdp  growth to employment levels to inﬂation, probability of recession, possibility of stagﬂation, etcetera. and so we reweighted our scenarios, and we took a level of provisions that we thought was appropriate on our wholesale book relative to the outlook that we see. w e continue to invest in our franchise. w e think it’ s important to continue to support our portfolio of corporate clients, but we will continue to provide appropriately along the way .",2,2022
4,2,Steven Chubak,question,question," very helpful. and maybe just for my follow-up for david on capital. you did cite plans to manage to the lower gsib surcharge of 3%, i know that you were on a path to potentially migrating as high as 3.5. i was hoping you could speak to the speciﬁc actions you’re taking to mitigate the gsib score whether we should be contemplating any level of revenue attrition from those actions. and does your ability to manage to that lower gsib surcharge inform the more aggressive tone that we heard on buyback?",2,2022
5,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," i appreciate the question. and let me try to give some clarity to our thought process. as monetary and ﬁscal policy were extremely loose and extremely forward, the opportunity set with our clients was expanding very , very rapidly . and the context of that in 2020 and 2021, we saw opportunities to deploy resources, serve our clients and, therefore, expand meaningfully the revenue opportunity and the proﬁt opportunity for the ﬁrm. that environment has certainly shifted in 2022. and while our clients are still active, they are not active to the same degree that they were in 2021. and you can obviously see that in the revenue environment, not just with us but across the street. in stating that we’re focused on controlling that resource growth and kind of bringing it back to a 3% level, we are making a forward assumption that’ s consistent with what we’ve seen in the ﬁrst half of the year . i note one of the things that i said in my comments was if there was information that would lead us to a different conclusion. w e will obviously evaluate that and change that. but based on the experience we’ve had over the last 6 months, and the revenue opportunity we’re capturing, we think we can continue to capture that revenue opportunity available based on client activity by being a little bit tougher on our resource allocation, and that should free up potentially some capital for shareholder return or potentially other investments. but i would think at this point in time, looking at that, denis highlighted in his remarks, with the stock trading where it is, we’re certainly thinking about that very carefully as we evaluate our capital return going forward for the rest of the year .",2,2022
0,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question," hi, good morning. one of the other areas for capital deployment, obviously , is in growing the consumer business. and i know you’ve got greensky into the belt, the general motors card. apple’ s doing gangbusters. so i just wanted to get a sense from you as to how you’re thinking about other opportunities you might see for either new partnership opportunities or is there balance sheet acquisition capabilities there?",2,2022
1,3,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. so thanks, betsy . so look, i think what i’d say with respect to that is there are lots of partnership opportunities and lots of people coming to us, given our relationships, our technology , etcetera, that are interested in doing things with us. at the same point, we’ve done a bunch over the course of the last 5 years to build this business. and as we’ve said, we put a couple of big partnerships on the ground in cards. w e’ve started an invest platform. w e’re now working to integrate greensky . i think our intention at the moment is to be focused on integrating these successfully and making sure we execute at a very high level. certainly , as we get out to 2023 and 2024, we will be more open to other partnerships and other meaningful things going forward. but at the moment, we’re focused on really executing on what we put forward, which included, as we had highlighted, launching checking later in the year .",2,2022
2,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question," yes. okay . and then separately on transaction banking, you’ve given us a lot of good metrics along the way on how that business has been building out. maybe you could update those a little bit for us today as well as give us a sense as to how the higher rate environment is impacting your returns there. i would think you’re running ahead of plan based on that or expected to by year-end? and how do you redeploy that fully into that business line or elsewhere? thanks.",2,2022
3,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," hey, betty , it’s denis. maybe i’ll take that one. as you suggest, we feel really good about the transaction banking business, it’ s progress year-to-date and the forward. we continue to improve on each of the metrics that we’ve been reporting on, so nearly 400 clients, deposits at around $65 billion revenues year-to-date $175 million. and importantly , we continue to improve the percentage of the deposits that are operational. operational and fully insured deposits are now north of 35% at the end of the second quarter . so we will continue to focus on growing overall clients balances and continuing to incrementally operationalize that business. it’ s obviously a proﬁtable business already . and it’ s a business, as david highlighted, that beneﬁts from leveraging the relationships that we have already inside the ﬁrm to grow it incrementally .",2,2022
0,4,Mike Mayo,question,question," hi, i guess i’m thinking in terms of the trade-of fs that you have to make, david, in terms of both capital and expenses. on capital, i mean, you talked about a broader , diverse, resilient, more annuity-like business stream, but then we get the fed stress test results and you guys ﬁnished in last place, albeit better than last year but still last place. so i guess the regulators don’t see it the same way that you do. and the trade-of f between managing for lower regulatory capital requirements versus the loss of revenues. and then the other dynamic decision is managing expenses lower . as you said you’re taking a closer look at that, the trade-of f between ensuring good proﬁt margins but at the risk of maybe losing revenues if things come back.",2,2022
1,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," i’m not sure there was a question there. i think there was a fair balance of exactly what we wrestle with. i mean i would highlight, while it’ s a fair comment that our scb is higher than everyone else’ s because of our current business mix, if that’ s what you refer to as last place, i would comment for the stress test we came in ﬁrst place is that we were the only ﬁrm that actually saw their scb decrease and many institutions saw their scb increase very meaningfully . now i don’t take that as a victory lap. w e’re early in the journey of taking assets of f our balance sheet, but i still do think, mike, one of the big attributes we have, as you look ahead over the next few years, is we are going to continue to make that business much less r wa dense. and i do think, as indicated by the step forward we took in this stress test, that we will hopefully take other steps forward and future tests as we continue to change that mix. i am not satisﬁed with where we are on the journey of making the ﬁrm more fee- based and more resilient. but i am satisﬁed that we’ve made meaningful progress. and i think the results this quarter show the diversity of the business in a positive light in what was a really tough operating environment. and so as someone who’ s followed the industry and our ﬁrm for quite some time, i think the performance in this environment is reﬂective of the beginning of that evolution. but you’re exactly right. we have to constantly balance between investing in the future and providing resources to serve clients when they are active and driving those shareholder returns that kind of are – is our true north of what we’re trying to drive towards. so yes, it’ s a balance. i think we’re trying to strike that balance appropriately , and we’re going to continue to be laser-focused on making sure we do as good a job as we can, striking that balance ef fectively .",2,2022
2,4,Mike Mayo,question,question," and on the second part, as it relates to expenses, it sounds like you’re going not quite plan b, but you’re getting ready in case you need a plan b. how long do these deals stay alive before it’ s pencils down and they just say , all right, we’re going to wait for the next cycle? i mean, it seems like with every month that passes, the chance that capital markets will rebound close to where it previously was declines. how long do you and the markets have before things just stay lower for longer?",2,2022
3,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, i guess i’d say a couple of things. w e always – i think we’re very nimble allocators of resources, ﬁnancial resources, human resources. w e try to have a very , very ﬂexible, nimble approach. and so of course, we’ve expressed earlier in the call, we think this is an uncertain environment, and we’re going to be cautious. of course, we will have plans in hand to the degree the environment gets worse. with respect to capital markets activity , i think i told you at the beginning of the year in our january call on january 15 that i did not expect us to see the level of capital markets activity we saw in 2021 anytime soon. and i wouldn’t call that as normal. so when you talk about capital markets activity going back to what we saw in the past couple of years. i, don’t think we’re going back to that anytime soon. but i do think if you look at capital markets activity kind of average levels over the last 7 years, take a period 5 years, 7 years, and look at average levels, i’d be very surprised if we don’t get back to some average level of capital markets activity sometime over the course of the next few quarters. and history would just tell you that, that doesn’t mean that it might not take a little bit longer this time if things get increasingly uncertain. but generally speaking, one of the things that af fects capital markets activity is people have to reset their mind around valuation. they have to reset their mind around capital costs. and that happens relatively quickly because people have plans. they have commitments. they have to invest. and as soon as they get their minds around that, they adjust, which takes a few quarters, they get back into the market that’ s available to them. and so i’d be very surprised if we don’t see, as we head into 2023, some sort of a normalization of capital markets activity . now we might not because the world could get worse, and it could stay more difﬁcult longer . but it’ s not baked in the cake, in my opinion, that we’re headed to a super negative environment, but it is uncertain. it is a little bumpy , and so we’re going to proceed cautiously .",2,2022
0,5,Brennan Hawken,question,question," good morning, david and denis. thanks for taking my question. i’d like to start on expenses. so you indicated that you’re adjusting the investments, but it sounds more like that’ s about slowing the hiring outlook. so maybe the impact there has a lag, and we’re more talking about year-end or even into 2023 and more on the comp side. so curious about, number one, whether that’ s a fair interpretation. and then number two, the best way to think about non-comp if we adjust for the legal charge and what – and maybe some higher bc&e this quarter , is this the right jumping of f point for non- comp? or might some of that expense diligence that you ﬂagged also put some downward pressure on the non-comp line? thanks.",2,2022
1,5,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so two components to your question. and obviously , we manage the ﬁrm to an efﬁciency ratio, looking at both the comp side and the non-comp side of the equation meaning as you would have seen through the ﬁrst half of the year , we’ve taken compensation expense down signiﬁcantly , $3.5 billion less comp expense in the ﬁrst half versus the ﬁrst half last year . and at the same time, we did see some increases on the non-compensation side of the equation. as we look forward into the second half, as we indicated, yes, slow velocity of hiring, decreased replacement of attrition, probably reinstating our annual performance review of our employee base at the end of the year , something that we suspended during the period of the pandemic for the most part and just being much more disciplined and focused on utilization efﬁciency of our human capital resources, given overall environment. and you’re right, some of that will take time to reﬂect itself through the p&l. so i think that’ s the right expectation. you are correct in anticipating that we’re also looking at non-compensation expenses and taking some actions there as well to slow the rate of growth and reduce certain components of our non- compensation expense. some of them are – dovetail well with investments that we’re making to grow the ﬁrm. and some of those activities will obviously look to continue. we may slow the pace, but we will continue to grow the activities that support the growth of the ﬁrm. and there are other items in non-compensation expense, occupancy as an example or travel expenses, where we actually see the impact of inﬂation, impacting on the overall level of expense. and so that’ s just going to require us to work harder to manage towards our overall efﬁciency target, which is i think the comments and references that both david and i have made with respect to our orientation on the expense front.",2,2022
2,5,Brennan Hawken,question,question," okay , great. thanks for that color , denis. appreciate it. and for the second question, i am curious, we have seen – you talked a lot about m&a  and how , obviously , your investment bank franchise is holding up really well. but just sort of a question around the environment and we have seen riskier debt issuance slow a lot year-to-date and started to hear chatter that availability has actually continued to become challenging. so, curious whether or not that’ s also what you are seeing and whether or not there is any concern that, that availability , lesser availability might become a challenge and lead to some pockets of stress for some of the more levered borrowers?",2,2022
3,5,David Solomon,answer,answer," i think it’ s a good – i think it’ s an appropriate thing to look at carefully . i would say , at the moment, real availability issues are limited to some very , very stressed borrowers or some very , very out-of-favor sectors. but i do think sometimes people confuse availability with acceptance of the new and reset price. and so i would say , at the moment, the bigger thing that’ s slowing down capital markets activity is people accepting of the new price environment. ultimately , companies need to raise capital. they ﬁnd that new clearing price. but i do think if the environment stays very , very difﬁcult from an economic perspective, there are certain sectors where availability is an issue. and there are a couple of them now . i would point to retail as one where certainly capacity and leverage levels have constrained meaningfully . and so i think we will watch this very cautiously . but again, i would tell you that there is a mindset when you go through this in a resetting that’ s going on, and i think ultimately , markets ﬁnd clearing prices. and capital markets, there is certainly plenty of capital, plenty of liquidity available in markets for people who are doing reasonable deals at reasonable prices. the most levered companies will have a tougher time in this environment.",2,2022
4,5,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," i mean another thing i would add just that very same environment also presents an opportunity . so, as an example, in our ficc ﬁnancing business, there are a number of clients who are looking for ﬁnancing. they have important transactions to execute, attractive assets to have ﬁnanced. and to the extent that there is less availability of ﬁnancing across the street, that presents an opportunity for us given the way that we are currently positioned, our focus on ﬁnancing and the franchise relationship we have with those clients that are big users.",2,2022
0,6,Devin Ryan,question,question," great. good morning david and denis. a question on the ria  custody of fering, can you just talk a little bit about the evolution of that of fering and whether we should expect a more aggressive acceleration in the marketing of that of fering in the coming quarters? there has been some recent press suggesting that you guys are better integrating that with the broader goldman capability . so, i would love to just get an update on your thinking there?",2,2022
1,6,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, we obviously – we made an acquisition in the space. it’ s something that we are focused on as an opportunity for the ﬁrm. but i would say , at this point, the resources and the size and the scope of that are relatively small. but i think as we look forward over the course of the next 3 years to 5 years, it will be an area that we see opportunity in and we will turn more focus to expanding. that’ s why we made this acquisition and we think it’ s an interesting opportunity for us.",2,2022
2,6,Devin Ryan,question,question," okay , great. thanks. and then a follow-up here, denis just touched on this, but we heard a lot about trading client deleveraging through the second quarter that drove down prime brokerage and margin balances at a number of ﬁrms in the industry . it didn’t seem to impact your trading or ﬁnancing results. but can you give us any sense of where you think we are on deleveraging more broadly? is there another leg that could exist here or clients now operating at lower levels of leverage relative to recent history and how that interplays with your trading outlook as well?",2,2022
3,6,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. i appreciate the question. i mean connecting it back to some of the comments that dave has made looking back over the course of the last couple of years, we have gone through an extraordinary period. w e see an ongoing transition into a new type of market environment. i am sure there are some clients that have looked to de- lever themselves and position for the current operating environment. w e continue to see very high levels of client opportunity . there was a lot of engagement in the second quarter particularly in the macro businesses clients approaching us to help them intermediate risk, other clients looking for ﬁnancing, which is why we had record performance in ficc ﬁnancing. and i think as we look forward, we are obviously starting the quarter with a buf fer to our minimum capital position. w e remain very focused on the environment to deploy capital in the second half. w e think there should be some good opportunities and there may be clients that incrementally turned to us to help them navigate the opportunities. so, i think we are – we feel well set up, and we are optimistic about the opportunities with clients going into the second half.",2,2022
0,7,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," hey. good morning. i guess i just wanted to follow-up on the strategic targets, david. so, you said multiple times on the call that you don’t see any reason why goldman won’t achieve i think your rote target 15% to 17% by ‘24. when we think about that, i think when investors struggle with is just the lack of visibility on the revenue side and how quickly you can ﬂex expenses. just give us a sense of when we think about year-to-date rote about 13%, the journey from here to your targets, how much of that is reliant on the macro getting better versus do you think structurally the business can continue to become more proﬁtable without any improvement in the macro?",2,2022
1,7,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, if we stayed in a macro – if we stayed in a macro environment, it’ s – look, it’ s a good question. i understand where the question comes from. if we stayed in the macro environment, like the ﬁrst six months of this year for the next 5 years, i think it would have an impact on the journey with respect to returns. although i do think that we would be more resilient and probably do better than the base perception would be of the industry broadly , by the way , not just goldman sachs, if you really have that kind of environment because the world would adapt to that kind of environment and people would make changes in their businesses on the expense side, etcetera, over time to make sure that they could deliver appropriately for shareholders. i don’t expect – i think we had a very – i think this has been a very difﬁcult six months and there have been some big headwinds in the course of the six months. i don’t expect to have the same headwinds in the next 6 months or the next 12 months. now that doesn’t mean that the environment couldn’t be worse or there couldn’t be dif ferent headwinds that create dif ferent issues. but i think to kind of take what’ s going on with some of the exogenous impact over the course of the last six months and translate it as a 3-year or 4-year thing forward, that’ s just not our base case. that’ s not our base case. and if that was our base case, we would be much more aggressive and forward with respect to expense changes, investments in the business, etcetera, but that’s not our base case. and so we continue to move forward with the base case, where we are pretty conﬁdent that we can deliver the level of revenues with an expense base and a resource allocation that we can adjust and be nimble with to deliver those returns. and i would just highlight that, in the ﬁrst half of the year , we are not that far of f from what we said we need to accomplish over the next 3 years.",2,2022
2,7,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," that’ s helpful. thank you for that. and then just – and recognizing it’ s very challenging to predict trading activity . but when you think about just good volatility versus bad volatility , do you see – just given all the uncertainty on macros for central bank actions, etcetera, this in terms of ﬁxed trading, things to remain strong as we think about the back half of the year , just whatever is in your crystal ball?",2,2022
3,7,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, the good volatility , bad volatility has never been an expression that i would like. i think about our business in markets as a business were serving our clients, and we re making sure that we are meeting their needs. that’ s why we have been very focused over the last 3 years, 4 years on really improving our approach to our clients, really improving our market share with our clients, adding ﬁnancing as a capability to our clients, which is much more resilient and therefore, puts a base in the revenues that did not exist before. now that doesn’t mean that there can’t be volatility in the intermediation part of the business. i am not going to make a forecast as to what looks forward, but i think the investments we have made and our client focus and our market shares and our ﬁnancing business all give those markets businesses more balanced as we go forward. there will be environments where clients are more active and we can capture that and there will be environments where clients are a little bit more quiet, but we are prepared to serve them. and i think if we get out of quarter-to-quarter and continue to look over a 3-year period, there is a very big business that generates very accretive returns and serves our clients well.",2,2022
0,9,Matt O’Connor,question,question," hi. some good details on your loan portfolio and loan loss reserves on slide 1 1. and i just wanted to ask speciﬁcally on the consumer book, you have got about 13% reserves to loans. obviously , charge-of fs are only 2% and change. but how much of that reserve is kind of factoring in growth seasoning or just a more tough macro environment, how would you frame that?",2,2022
1,9,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. i think i would frame it actually as a combination of those factors. so, your seasoning point is fair as well. it’ s a less aged portfolio, if you will, than certain other broad-based consumer portfolios. there is an element of seasoning. there is an element of the overall macro environment that sort of come together to call us – that that’s the appropriate place to be. you do make reference to charge-of fs. obviously , ﬁrm-wide, they are ﬂat quarter-on-quarter . wholesale, down slightly . consumer is up a little bit. but those are some of the factors that we also take into account and look at.",2,2022
2,9,Matt O’Connor,question,question," and i know earlier you were asked about kind of through the cycle provisioning. and anything speciﬁcally on consumer charge-of fs as we think about those portfolios, what you would expect once you have the seasoning and what those levels would be, not in a recession, but just more kind of through the cycle?",2,2022
3,9,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," yes. i mean i think through the cycle is where we are in terms of our observation, so whether the impact presently is more a function of normalization from really quite exceptional set of conditions in the last year . the starting point – the overall health of the consumer is very strong. the credit environment for consumers has been very , very benign. and so i think you need to take stock of sort of where you are starting from. obviously , if the environment continues to persist more negatively and certainly if we were to move towards recession, then we would expect an increase in that regard.",2,2022
0,10,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," thank you. good morning. david, in the past couple of years, you guys have focused on reducing your equity portfolio so that the volatility in earnings would be less. can you share with us where you are in that progress? are you at a level that you are comfortable with, or you still got some more to go in reducing that portfolio?",2,2022
1,10,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. i will answer at a very high level, and then i am going to have denis walk you through some speciﬁc details. i am pleased with the progress, but not comfortable with where we are. comfortable is probably the wrong word. i am pleased with the progress. i would like us to continue to accelerate to make more progress. and i think we are going to do – we are going to make progress over the course of the coming 12 months, 24 months. our progress – we have made a lot of progress. it was slowed also by the fact that went through a period in 2021 where the value of a lot of these assets grew very meaningfully even as we were selling things. but why don’t i have denis walk you through some high-level numbers that we have put out there?",2,2022
2,10,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," yes. so, a couple of things. i think we are – we are well on our way in terms of the journey . we remain completely committed to the progress and the direction of travel. you will note there were no particular additions over the course of the last quarter . we continued to move down certain of the on-balance sheet equity exposures. w e have a detailed asset-by-asset plan that we are executing on. and looking at our results coming through ccar, obviously , the fed recognized our strong ppnr, but we also suspect that the way they concluded the ultimate decision around scb had something to do with the nature of our on-balance sheet equity investments and the shocks that they choose to apply against that portfolio. and so that’ s incremental afﬁrmation that we have selected the right strategy . and then if anything, we should continue to move forward, maybe even accelerate the rate of disposition, remaining mindful of the overall environment and the ability to execute. but i think the direction of travel for us and our commitment to reducing those exposures is completely unchanged.",2,2022
3,10,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," very good. and just as a follow-up, maybe you guys can give us a little deeper color into the ecm business. obviously , according to the dealogic numbers, the ﬁrst six months of this year , we all know were very weak and market conditions, we recognize as being the driver . but david, you alluded to maybe the price expectations are coming down. w as it primarily just the volatility that pushed everybody to the sideline? w as it lower valuations that pushed them there? what did you guys see as the biggest drivers for these really weak numbers for the industry , not just for you folks?",2,2022
4,10,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. it’ s – i think it’ s a combination, gerard, of all those things. you had a meaningful decrease in values in the public market and in the private market. you also had real volatility . and so people go down the road, doing an ipo, it’ s like a tanker . it’s heading down the road. it takes months and months and months of preparation, sometimes years of preparation. and you get your mind and you get with all the shareholders that you are going to go public at a particular value, a particular price. and all of a sudden, the value of the price is 20% or 30% less and the whole tanker just stops. they can’t turn on a dime and get everybody’ s mind reset. and so i think a shift in valuations and that volatility had a big impact. the period in terms of the anemic nature of equity capital markets issuance kind of reminds me of the period in 2002, where we obviously had enormous growth in equity capital markets activity in 1999, 2000, 2001. and then in march 2001, you started to see a real change in market and valuation. it was the beginning of a decline in the nasdaq, where the nasdaq ultimately went down 85%. i am not saying that that’ s going to happen again here. but really , equity issuance shutof f in late 2001 and 2002 was a really , really anemic year for equity issuance and started picking back up again in 2003. and so there is a reset process with all of this. and i think we are on the journey of people’ s expectation around valuations being reset.",2,2022
0,11,Jim Mitchell,question,question," hey. good morning. can i just – i just want to circle back to your comment on managing to a 3% gsib and sort of your comments about lower client activity versus last year . but i think on the ﬂip side, you guys are pretty optimistic around growing – still growing the ﬁnancing business. it looks like trading assets are up year-over-year or ﬂat year-over-year . loans are up, balance sheet is up. so, is this just something about balance sheet and r wa growth slowing or is there speciﬁc areas you think will shrink or you can cut?",2,2022
1,11,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so, i think we are looking at this holistically . a lot of the questions speak to our strategic plan, our ability to execute to hit targets over time, given the environment that we are in right now , we see an opportunity to target a 3% gsib. obviously , it’s for the beneﬁt of 2024, and beyond, but the decision to be made is a current one. and so in terms of our ability to target that level, given what we have seen in terms of various balances, levels of client activity , etcetera, we think we can do that reasonably efﬁciently . we have had discussions with our business leaders. they know that, that’ s the plan. that’ s what they are working on. david did make a comment that should the environment change signiﬁcantly or the needs of our clients change we would reevaluate. but the current plan is to target that level of gsib. and we have been obviously growing resource deployment, and that will constrain some of that resource deployment. but in addition to targeting a 3% gsib we can, at the same time, deploy other ﬁnancial resources to attractive client opportunities. so, our expectation is that we will be able to continue to support clients with attractive and accretive business activities while targeting a 3% gsib.",2,2022
2,11,Jim Mitchell,question,question," well, can you help us a little bit with the speciﬁcs of what you are actually targeting, or is that you are unwilling to disclose that?",2,2022
3,11,Denis Coleman,answer,answer, we are currently targeting a 3% gsib. w e are not putting out a particular gsib score that we are targeting.,2,2022
0,12,Dan Fannon,question,question," thanks. try this again here. just wanted to follow-up on the $20 billion of commitments in – or third-party funds that you highlighted in the quarter , clearly , there is still strong momentum. as you think about this market backdrop and the outlook for that is there – are you seeing any change in behavior or signs of slowing?",2,2022
1,12,David Solomon,answer,answer," i would say , dan, at the moment, at a high macro level, we are not seeing signiﬁcant change in behavior . when you look at the institutional capital allocators around the world, the institutional capital allocators have signiﬁcant allocations. obviously , if the overall value of the portfolio has decreased, the allocation percentage would shift, and so that will slow down capital raising. but i think for leading big global platforms that are multiproduct and global, i still think there is a secular growth trend around alternatives that’ s very , very attractive probably not at the exact same pace and that you saw in 2021, but certainly a strong secular growth trend that kind of moves forward with respect to allocations of capital by big institutional allocators into the space. i would say one of the places that a number of participants in the market, we have not been as big a participant, but there has been a lot of retail ﬂow into the alternative space. and there my insight there is that is slowing, but it’ s not turned of f and it’ s still adequate. and from what i can see in our private wealth lens that we have with a very , very high-end private wealth business, there is still signiﬁcant interest in alternatives as people move forward, so something to watch. if the environment got much worse, may be that would change, but at the moment, not seeing indications that the changes are meaningful.",2,2022
2,12,Dan Fannon,question,question," great. and then just as a follow-up on the balance sheet outlook and the harvesting of some of the investments. you have historically given a line of sight number on these calls given i would assume the market backdrop in the short-term, there is just less outlook or clarity around what you might be looking to sell here.",2,2022
3,12,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," i think that’ s right. so, last quarter , we gave a line of sight of approximately $1 billion, which is what ended up happening. right now , line of sight is less than $1 billion, just given the overall environment that’ s what we see right now .",2,2022
0,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," hi, thanks very much. so given the capital r wa and expense actions that you have already taken, if 2023 is a little bit better in banking, but it’ s kind of the same atmosphere we’ve been in because it feels like it’ s lingering. can you all get closer to your return targets this year? i know it’ s very difﬁcult in this backdrop but what i am getting at is do we need investment banking to be a lot better to get there or have the actions you’ve taken start closing the gap? thanks.",4,2022
1,0,David Solomon,answer,answer," so, thanks, glenn and i appreciate the question. obviously , an improved capital markets environment would certainly help in that direction. w e talk about our targets in a normalized environment. one thing i just want to make sure people are focused on is we have to do better in asset management. this certainly has been a part of our strategy over the last 3 years is to reduce our balance sheet and asset management. and we have made real progress on that over the last 3 years, but we still have a very signiﬁcant asset management balance sheet larger than we would like to have. w e reduced it by $9 billion this past year and we intend to move forward. but given the disruption in asset prices and the density of that balance sheet, it’ s not surprising when you have $32 billion of capital allocated to that segment. and if you look at the fourth quarter , the fourth quarter , it earned zero, even with some businesses in there that are highly proﬁtable, i don’t think that’ s normal. i don’t think our expectation is that continues exactly the same way . and so i think a combination of some normalization in capital markets activities and a more balanced environment with respect to the asset management balance sheet certainly would have a big impact. i’d highlight last year , we way outperformed the peer average roe by about 900 basis points because of kind of the massive outperformance of that balance sheet, given all the stimulus and a bunch of that reversed, and we’re just more sensitive to that.",4,2022
2,0,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," i mean things i might add, glenn, is in addition to our business mix on the [forward] (ph) i think the reason why we’re taking action with respect to our headcount footprint and some of our non-compensation expenses is to drive efﬁciency even further . and as you point out, with the capital build that we have as at the beginning of the year , we’re in a pretty ﬂexible position in terms of how we can deploy that either in support of attractive opportunities within the business and/or returning incremental capital to shareholders.",4,2022
3,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," okay . i appreciate that. and then maybe staying up to 50,000, transaction banking is good, but it’ s unfortunately a small revenue base. consumer maybe music to some investors ears is being deemphasized. so i guess my question is, whereas your goal is to build a more durable ﬁrm and i share that goal, where do you think that comes from going forward if some of the pieces are either small or being deemphasized from the past strategy? thanks.",4,2022
4,0,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, i think, glenn, the big thing in that, and it’ s always been a big part of it is the shift from a balance sheet intensive asset management business to a client-oriented fee-based business. our organic growth across our asset management business on a relative basis was still good in 2022 when you look broadly across the industry . we continue to grow our management fees in the asset management business. w e’re continuing to grow our wealth business. our wealth business overall grew nicely during the course of 2022. and so it’ s that mix change, less balance sheet intensity , growth in asset and wealth management, continued ﬁnancing growth in our core global banking and markets business, which you’ve seen and continue to grow and then getting these platforms that we have to operate proﬁtably , which we believe we can do. w e believe they are good businesses at scale, but they are in a dif ferent stage of the development. those things should make the business more resilient, and that’ s not inconsistent with the strategy we laid out 3 years ago, and we will amplify again next month at investor day . what i think was an outlier for sure in this environment is the massive quick swing in asset prices and the impact that our capital markets heavy and balance sheet intense business had, of course, with a drag from some of the investments we’re making in other things.",4,2022
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," good morning and thank you. i guess maybe, david, just sticking to that, as you make the asset management business less dense in terms of balance sheet consumption, how do we think about the rote target you put out last year? is that still achievable within the 3-year time frame that you had laid out or does that get pushed out given the work that needs to be done and, in a world, where consumer is being deemphasized?",4,2022
1,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," i think, candidly , that it depends on the environment. an environment with massive swing in asset prices continues, we will push it out. if that simply normalizes then the overall economic picture of the ﬁrm, in addition to the work we’re doing on the expense side that we’ve gotten focused on, will show a very , very dif ferent picture. i’m not going to guess on how that will play out. but again, i’d amplify that i don’t think what we saw in 2022 was normal. and certainly , if you go back and look at 15 years of history , it wasn’t.",4,2022
2,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," okay . and i guess just as a follow-up in terms of growth in asset management, wealth management, signiﬁcant asset price dislocations. does that create some m&a opportunities when you think about inorganic growth in those businesses? or for the time being is the expectation that most of this is going to be organic?",4,2022
3,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," i think at the moment, we’re extremely focused on in 2023, executing on the decisions we made to invest in our platform and moving forward from here, i do think that in the future, there still could be inorganic opportunities to accelerate the journey in asset and wealth management. but certainly , this year , we’re focused on the execution. w e made an acquisition in asset management last year . we want to integrate nnip . we want to move forward with that. so i think this year , we will be focused on execution.",4,2022
4,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question, got it. thank you.,4,2022
0,2,Steven Chubak,question,question," hey, good morning.",4,2022
1,2,David Solomon,answer,answer, good morning.,4,2022
2,2,Steven Chubak,question,question," so david and denis, i wanted to start of f with a question just on the provision outlook. admittedly , the loan loss provision came in higher than we had anticipated. and i was hoping you could just speak to, how much of it was growth math related versus deterioration in the macro? and given some of the planned actions you’re going to take for that business, how should we think about like a normalized level of loan growth and provision expectation that we should expect going forward?",4,2022
3,2,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," good morning, thank you for that so let me help with some color as it relates to provisions, particularly in the fourth quarter . so order of magnitude, the component of that build attributable to growth was about 50%. net charge-of fs about 25%, and the balance attributable to our scenario. i think what you can see in the build of the provisions over the course of the fourth quarter , and we do expect some of this to continue over the course of 2023 is that we began the on-balance sheet originations in our point-of-sale lending platform, greensky . and so that obviously brings with it an upfront reserve build. so that’ s something that initiated over the balance of this past year and will continue through the following year .",4,2022
4,2,Steven Chubak,question,question," got it. and maybe just for a follow-up on capital. as it relates to the discussion tied to glenn’ s question, i was hoping you could speak to how you’re scenario planning for basel iv , basel iii end game. i recognize we don’t have a proposal yet, but certainly , it has signiﬁcant implications for future returns you can generate. you’re running with a healthy level of cushion at the moment. but just wanted to understand how you see it impacting your various businesses? what planned actions can you take to maybe mitigate some of the pain?",4,2022
5,2,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. fair question on everybody’ s mind. as you note, we don’t yet have the details. but we give it a lot of thought. w e’ve taken a number of steps in terms of building out our modeling capabilities to make sure as and when we do get an actual rule that we will be in a position to respond quickly to that. w e do have a long-standing track record of responding to changes to regulatory guidance. you can see over the course of the fourth quarter across a number of our ﬁnancial resources that we were able to maneuver them very , very quickly to build capital and change our r wa footprint, given our view of the environment and some strategic decisions there. so we’re standing by for more detail on the rule, but conﬁdent that when we get it, we will be able to manage accordingly .",4,2022
6,2,Steven Chubak,question,question, that’ s great. thanks for taking my questions.,4,2022
0,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question," hi, good morning.",4,2022
1,3,David Solomon,answer,answer," good morning, betsy .",4,2022
2,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer, good morning.,4,2022
3,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question," two questions. one follow-up on the consumer business, i heard you on the markets pull back, you’re going to see originating there. does that give you more room to lean into growth and we should expect acceleration and the partner card greensky , those pieces that you are keeping or is this market pullback going to feed either capital increase or the ability to lean in other business lines like the isg business?",4,2022
4,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. betsy , it’s denis. i’ll start with that. so as we indicated, we’re going to cease the originations in under marcus lending. and then furthermore, expect for that portfolio actually to roll of f or we may pursue other alternatives. that should free up a bunch of ﬁnancial resources. w e’re continued within the overall asset and wealth management segment where the deposit business is resident within the private banking and lending line. that remains a strategic priority for the ﬁrm, and we’ve experienced very good growth there. that business is achieving more and more scale. so that will remain an ongoing focus. i think once we have reduced some of the resourcing allocated to markets and lending, we will continue to narrow the focus of our ambitions and our investment spend. and within the platform solutions business, we’re now down to three dif ferent businesses: transaction banking, the cards platform and our point-of-sale lending business, greensky . and our focus is really on just narrowing to drive those businesses across the segment to proﬁtability .",4,2022
5,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question," okay . then separate question just on the expenses in this quarter . i know you had the action of the headcount reduction. is there a severance embedded in this quarter that we should strip out because, obviously , it’s not ongoing? or does that hit 1q? maybe you could speak to how we should think about that? thanks.",4,2022
6,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thanks, betsy . because we communicated the reductions in 2023, any associated severance expense associated with those reductions will be 2023 expenses.",4,2022
7,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question," okay , thanks.",4,2022
0,4,Mike Mayo,question,question," hi. i have one. dave, i think it’ s your birthday today , right? you announced that a few years ago.",4,2022
1,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," it is my birthday , and i couldn’t be happier to be on this call with you. but thank you. thank you for that.",4,2022
2,4,Mike Mayo,question,question," well, since it’ s your birthday , do you want the positive question or the negative question ﬁrst.",4,2022
3,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," you want – i’m happy to take any question. any question that you have, mike. you know that. w e’re happy to take questions both positive and tough. i mean it wasn’t a great quarter . so i don’t expect all the questions to be easy .",4,2022
4,4,Mike Mayo,question,question," well, i mean, it is concerning in terms of the reorg, i mean we will get more at the investor day . and just a comment, i hope you give us more data. here we have three new sectors, and you only gave us the prior four quarters and the prior 2 years without much detail. so i hope you give us more ahead. but the question is, you present the ﬁrm dif ferently , but will the ﬁrm actually be run dif ferently other than the more narrow focus on consumer?",4,2022
5,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. and so i appreciate that. and to – two comments. first, just on the transparency and information comment, i think this management team, mike, over the last 4.5 years has been super focused on increasing the transparency of goldman sachs, and we remain focused on that. if you have certain feedback on things you’d like to see, etcetera, we really welcome that, and carey will reach out to you, and we will take that feedback. but we’re focused on giving our investors more and more and creating the right kind of transparency around what we’re doing. second, on the evolution and the move to this, what i’d say , and this has been something that’ s been a journey that we started a number of years ago, but the ﬁrm is now organized and presented externally the same way we run it internally . and that candidly is a dif ference than the way goldman sachs has been during my tenure at the ﬁrm. in terms of our core business of banking and markets, there are synergies that we’ve been driving as these businesses cooperate that we think we can now get more out of in our client orientation across our broad franchise that this organization of those businesses together really helps. i highlight that we feel great about the performance of those businesses since our investor day . it’s long forgotten. but when we did our investor day , back in 2020, nobody believed that we could get the roe of the markets business above 10%. that was a big question on the minds of investors. and we look now at our combined banking and markets business, this business, we think, is a leader . it outperforms in terms of its market share and outperforms in terms of its returns relative to competitors, and we continue to grow it and continue to stay laser-focused on the client experience and also the returns and the performance of that business. w e also think there continues to be opportunity to grow our ﬁnancing business there, and we’re very , very focused on that. in asset and wealth management, we’ve worked hard to bring a number of businesses together into an integrated franchise so we can really have transparency and focus on our ability to grow management fees and drive performance and serve more clients in that business. and as we’ve said over the last few years, reduce the balance sheet intensity of that. and we’re on a journey . would i like it to be further along? yes. if it was further along, there would have been less volatility , particularly in the context of this year in the fourth quarter . but we continue – that’ s something we laid out 3 years ago, and we continue to move at that. the change strategically of a narrowing of our focus on certain things in consumer business, i think, is a change. we continue to feel very good about the deposit platform and the contribution it makes. w e think our partnership with apple will provide meaningful dividends for the ﬁrm over time. w e think greensky is a good business that can be accretive, but the platforms are in a dif ferent stage of development than our other businesses. they are small in the overall scale of goldman sachs, but we think there are beneﬁts to that for the ﬁrm. w e will communicate more as we move forward around that, but we’re making progress and we will continue to run that narrow focus in a way that we think can drive proﬁtability . so that’ s a high-level response. i don’t know if there is something else you want me to drill into, but that’ s a high-level response.",4,2022
6,4,Mike Mayo,question,question," yes, the follow-up is more speciﬁc. i mean, look, you said it’ s a disappointing quarter . your returns are well below where you want them to be, and variable revenues and variable costs, not so much your efﬁciency ratios go the other direction. so i mean, i think investors would appreciate some detail on some of the beneﬁts of what you might get on the expense side, okay , you’re scaling back consumer as i asked you last quarter , you said you were losing money so maybe you lose less money . the headcount reduction should allow you to save money . so can you ballpark the beneﬁts to expenses from the moves in consumer and the headcount reductions? and along those lines now that you’ve moved capital well above the regulatory and your own ﬁrm’ s target buyback so cost and buyback kind of what to think about for 2023?",4,2022
7,4,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure, mike, let me take that. so unpacking a couple components. so we exercised a headcount reduction earlier this year , approximately 3,200 employees left the ﬁrm. the run rate expense associated with that group was approximately $475 million, and we expect the beneﬁt in 2023 north of $200 million associated with that. beyond that, we have a series of non-compensation expense initiatives. w e’re setting out guardrails for our business leaders to drive more efﬁcient levels of non-compensation spend. the narrowing of the focus in consumer is important. there are a number of ways in which we could have chosen to expand the of fering and capabilities of that. the focus is now narrow . and then ﬁnally , as you identify , we have more ﬂexibility with respect to capital deployment, which we intend to take advantage of.",4,2022
0,5,Brennan Hawken,question,question," good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i just wanted to follow-up on some of those questions for mike. and just really be honest kind of surprised to not hear that there were restructuring and severance charges in the fourth quarter , just given how elevated the expenses were. so i guess, can you provide a little bit of color on the inﬂexibility , revenues down 20% for the full year . and i understand that, of course, markets are competitive, but the positioning of comp in 2021 was – it was a remarkable year . some of it even identiﬁed or segregated as special and therefore, shouldn’t be expected to repeat. so the – was the discipline fully there? are you doing enough on comp? you have reiterated the focus on efﬁciency , but the results here in – i get it, nobody is buying goldman today for 2022 results, but still the results seem to set up sort of a challenging entry point for the beginning of the year .",4,2022
1,5,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so brennan, a couple of questions. as for the reasons to take severance expense in 2023, that’ s the accounting rules with respect to timing of our communication to those employees. so that’ s what explains the time frame in which the expenses going to be booked. as it relates to compensation expense, variable expense ﬂexibility in the fourth quarter , i guess i would point out a couple of things. one, the overall comp and beneﬁt expense were down 15%. w e had grown headcount by 10% additionally . and when you – that’ s over $2.5 billion of less compensation and beneﬁt expense, so it’ s a meaningful number . and if you look at the components of our employee base, we have a very large number of people that earn relatively less money are impacted by inﬂation and are really important to the overall operation and delivery of our ﬁrm on behalf of our clients. and we have relatively fewer employees that are higher earning employees face clients and generate revenue, and we were able to reduce the compensation substantially there in line with the performance. but ultimately , it’s a balance. and we have excellent people. w e depend on them to deliver for clients. the market for talent remains really robust, and we had to strike the right balance between taking down that variable expense in respect of our performance while maintaining the franchise to make sure that we’re in the position that we can deliver for clients and shareholders in 2023 and beyond. certainly , we can have brighter opportunity sets on the forward and we want to make sure that we are positioned to capture that.",4,2022
2,5,Brennan Hawken,question,question," okay . alright. thanks for that color , denis. i appreciate that. this one might end up being moved, but i just don’t want to conﬁrm it. i have spend some time yesterday looking at previous disclosures of j-curve expectation and whatnot, but it seems as though exiting marcus and the tone down. should we not even be thinking about a j- curve for the consumer business? is that not a consideration here any longer because it does seem as though the cross through from the breakeven even ex- provision has been a lot longer than expected. so, should we just forget about that chart given the pivot, or does that still remain part of the consideration?",4,2022
3,5,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so, a couple of things i would point out. as people would have seen in the earnings release this morning, the platform solutions segment on a quarter-over-quarter basis actually had reduced operating expenses. so, we remain really focused on continuing to drive at the expense of these platforms in aggregate, and we expect to drive a lot of beneﬁt at scale. but as we have discussed and you will observe, we also continue to build our provisions as we scale some of those activities. and so our focus remains singularly on driving towards proﬁtability of this segment, but there will continue to be a period of time during which we lose money until we reach that point of ultimate proﬁtability . and we do look forward to trying to help people understand and map out that progression across the various businesses within that segment at investor day .",4,2022
0,6,Devin Ryan,question,question," great. good morning david and denis and happy birthday , david.",4,2022
1,6,David Solomon,answer,answer, thank you.,4,2022
2,6,Devin Ryan,question,question," i guess just ﬁrst one to zero in on transaction banking here in platforms. $325 million for transaction banking and other in 2022 is up 50% year-over-year . so, you guys have really had great growth from scratch just a couple of years ago, but still obviously immaterial. so, i just want to talk a little bit about how you feel like progress is going in that part of the business. can this get to a multi-billion dollar business just doing kind of what it’ s already doing? i know you just launched in europe there, really just trying to think about kind of the execution roadmap for that part of the business.",4,2022
3,6,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thanks for that question. now , we are very pleased with the progress of the transaction banking business, and it’ s a business that has particular beneﬁts as we scale activities on it. w e have our tech platform up and running. w e continue to grow our clients on the platform. they unanimously continued to give us the feedback that it is a very dif ferentiated and attractive platform to be part of. and we have taken that business, as you say , from its inception to larger scale. w e think there is a lot of potential for that business on the forward. and we are very focused at this point in time in continuing to drive deposit balances, continue to drive our customer count, further penetrate, as you mentioned, our international expansion continues. w e have opened in our ﬁfth country . we now have increasing capabilities to serve clients across the world. there are true beneﬁts to the network ef fect of a business like this with global reach. and we continue to see very , very good opportunities for this business.",4,2022
4,6,Devin Ryan,question,question," okay . great. thanks. a follow-up here just on the market’ s ﬁnancing opportunity . so, that’s already obviously been a nice part of the story for goldman. what do you need to do to grow ﬁnancing further? is it just a lot of the same kind of blocking and tackling, or are there speciﬁc things you could point to that could drive kind of another step function there? and then just kind of more near-term, you talked about prime brokerage balances being down and declining through the quarter . has that changed at all just to start this year with risk appetite to maybe a bit better today than through most of the fourth quarter?",4,2022
5,6,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," yes. a couple of comments i would make. so, i think as it relates to the ficc ﬁnancing, we have a very good opportunity set in front of us. the progress that we have made with the client franchise and our market shares and given the overall backdrop and the availability of ﬁnancing in the world right now , our clients continue to come to us. and given the capital position that we sit with at the beginning of the year, we have capacity to fuel incremental ﬁnancing activities in the ficc business. on the equity side of the equation, obviously , asset markets moved around quite severely , particularly in the end of the year , which drives prime brokerage balances. but as you know , we are also working very hard to reduce our ﬁnancial resource footprint, particularly our g-sib level. that brought with it signiﬁcant r wa reductions. and it was not really the environment that we were pushing on growth, certainly in the fourth quarter . i think as we turn the page on a new year, there is lots of opportunity for us to continue to drive our equity ﬁnancing activities, and we have less constraints given that we have now achieved the 3% g-sib target.",4,2022
6,6,Devin Ryan,question,question, okay . thank you.,4,2022
0,7,Dan Fannon,question,question," thanks. good morning. i wanted to expand upon the new slide 7. and as you look at the dif ferent buckets and asset classes, how much of these funds are evergreen and open or are going through periodic fund raises and closings? and i was hoping you could maybe provide some context on what the fundraising has been for subsequent funds, meaning the size increase that you have typically seen for second or third funds from the previous one to give us a sense of the momentum you are seeing in that business?",4,2022
1,7,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so, we always have a very , very broad portfolio of funds. and we have been in this investing business for a number of decades, and it’ s one of the contributors to our position as the number ﬁve largest active asset management ﬁrm in the world. and across the portfolio of dif ferent funds, we have some extremely mature businesses. our gs capital partners, equity investing business, our mezzanine funds, some of our loan funds. w e have multiple mature businesses that are frequently deploying successfully and then going back to raise new monies and continue to support sort of the franchises that we have in that channel. and we continued to diversify and expand our of fering and open up new strategies in response to what we see are pockets for client demand. so, as we think about the overall opportunity set, we have a global, broad and deep investing platform that has offerings for many dif ferent types of investors, many of which are very , very mature in terms of their track record and some of which are newer .",4,2022
2,7,Dan Fannon,question,question," okay . and then just following up on the earlier question around kind of the ficc and trading backdrop. it sounds like you are through kind of the optimization of r was, but maybe can you talk about where you see on the broader intermediation side, the backdrop, maybe the backdrop today and maybe where you see market share opportunities into the rest of the year?",4,2022
3,7,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so, we continue to focus on market share. market share data lags, but through the third quarter of last year , it shows that we continued to grow market share in those businesses, sales and trading. so, that remains a very , very core focus of the ﬁrm. w e continue to make progress, and we think we can make incremental progress. one of the attractive things about that business for us is that we have a number of dif ferent business lines, which have enabled us to perform across a variety of environments. the last year , given what happened with rate normalization and energy markets around the world, were a particular tailwind to the interest rate products business, the commodities business. meanwhile, we had softer performance in credit, mortgages and some of the equity intermediation activities. certainly , if the new issue debt underwriting markets come back online as early indications on the investment-grade side of things suggest and if the equity underwriting activities are to open up, there is a lot of activity that takes place with investors as they position in advance of and after new of ferings that we should be able to capture, given the investment that we have made in the client franchise. so, i can’t predict exactly where activity will come from 2023. certainly , some of it may be a continuation of those areas that were active in 2022. but it’ s quite possible that certain activities that were softer in ‘22 could rotate and become more relevant in 2023.",4,2022
0,8,Matt O’Connor,question,question," good morning. you mentioned continued interest in asset and wealth management deals, kind of over time. it sounds more like bolt-on, but i guess just are you more open-minded towards maybe a transformational deal as we think out, not necessarily this year , but just in the next couple of years. i mean to-date, you have – what i would characterize, i think most people had characterized, you have piece-mailed some deals. you have done some organic expansion and mixed results in dif ferent areas. but just thoughts on maybe more openness to something transformational down the road.",4,2022
1,8,David Solomon,answer,answer," i think we have been asked this question. i appreciate the question. w e have been asked it a bunch over time. i think in certain businesses like asset and wealth management, there are signiﬁcant things that could meaningfully accelerate the platform. w e have the ﬁfth largest active asset manager in the world now that we have stood up all the businesses inside goldman sachs. and so that scale is real. and there certainly could be opportunities to increase that scale. and certainly , there are opportunities in wealth for us to do things that are more signiﬁcant. i would say that the bar to do those things is extraordinarily high. there are not a lot of opportunities out there necessarily to do it. certainly , over the last 5 years, the prices have been eye-popping, maybe we are in a dif ferent environment where well, that will normalize. but we are always open to things that we think can strengthen goldman sachs, but also as somebody that’ s been an m&a  banker for a signiﬁcant part of my career , i know the barter do that, the cultural issues, the integration issues, the bar has to be very , very high. so, i would say we are always open. but at the moment, our focus is on executing on the plate of opportunities we have in front of us, and we think we can drive good returns, good book value growth, good performance for our shareholders as we look forward in the coming few years with what we have on our plate.",4,2022
2,8,Matt O’Connor,question,question, okay . that was clear . thank you very much.,4,2022
0,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," thank you. good morning. david, in your opening comments, you gave us your three priorities of growing management fees in the asset & w ealth management business, maximizing the wallet share and growing ﬁnancing activities in global banking and markets and then scaling the platform. in your – in the number two, maximizing the wallet share, can you share with us where are you today with the wallet share, both in investment banking and markets? and how are you pursuing to grow that over the next couple of years?",4,2022
1,9,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. so, we – you can take a look at our performance in these businesses. and you can see that the performance is quite strong. a couple of things i will point to even in this quarter ’s performance. you can look at our relative m&a  revenue performance. you can look at our relative ficc performance and even our equities performance in what’ s been a tough quarter , the relatives look pretty good. w e set out 3 years ago, and this was a big structural change. w e had never really thought about client market shares in our markets business. w e had always thought about them in our investment banking business. and we really – we brought that ethos into the markets business. and i know everyone on this call has heard us talk about how 3 years ago, we set out to say there are 100 clients that contribute meaningfully to our ficc and equities businesses. and we are top three with only 44 of them. w e are now top three with 77 of those top 100. and now we have shifted the focus to really look at okay, top three, but why aren’t we wanted to, what are the number of clients that we can be number one and two with, and we think there is more room that we can drive on wallet share by really focusing and ticking equities on that number one and number two position. in banking, the wallet share has really come from footprint growth. that footprint grows candidly has been a little bit expensive when there has been zero capital markets revenue because that footprint growth does tilt toward capital markets activity , but we think that will serve us well if you take a 3-year or a 5- year view looking forward. so, again, there is a lot of attention paid to some of the things that we are investing in. the core of the ﬁrm is very strong. those wallet shares are strong, but we still see more opportunity and we are laser-focused on continuing to execute on it. and i don’t think there is any business in investment banking and markets that is as strong and powerful as this business, so we will continue to focus on strengthening it as we move forward.",4,2022
2,9,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," very good. and then as a follow-up on the shift in strategy in the consumer business, you have been very clear , obviously , on how you are positioning this going forward. i may have missed this, so i apologize. but what went wrong? when you go back to when you guys started to move into these businesses 3 years ago or so, i know marcus deposits has been around longer than that. but when you look back on what you were hoping to do and how it turned out, what went wrong?",4,2022
3,9,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, i think there are a bunch of things that went right, and there were some things that did not go well. i think we executed well on some things that we didn’t execute on others. but the simple thing that i would phrase, gerard, and i think it’ s a fair question, is we tried to do too much too quickly . and of course, in the environment that we are in, it’ s hard to go back when we started in that strategy 6 years ago. w e obviously built the deposit business, the loan business, and we talked about a much broader platform. and i think we came to the conclusion that there were some changes. one of the big changes that af fect the pace of the ability to do this and it’ s different in scaling things like this is cecl  is a big change. cecl  changed the curve on growing these lending businesses at scale from scratch. so, we have had to adjust to that. the regulatory environment has also changed over the course of the last couple of years. but i think it became clear to us early in 2022 that we were doing too much, was af fecting our execution. i think we probably , in some places, haven’t had all the talent that we have needed to execute the way we have wanted. we are making adjustments on that, but by narrowing down the three core things that we are going to focus on that we actually think are good businesses that can be accretive to the ﬁrm. i think we have got it in a place now where we can create a more cogent path forward. and so that’ s what we are doing. and i – the takeaway i would like investors to understand is when we see things, we look at things and we pivot. w e are not married to things. w e are willing to change. i think when i go back to our 2020 investor day , and i look at what we laid out during that period of time, we have accomplished and have executed on the vast majority of things we have laid out. that doesn’t mean there is not more work to do. but you know what, we didn’t execute perfectly on some. so, we have taken a hard look at those and you make adjustments. and that’ s kind of the ethos of the nimbleness of goldman sachs that i want to amplify . we are always willing to make changes. w e are always going to be focused on shareholders. and even though everything has not gone perfectly , again, i would point to our 40% book value growth since our investor day , and i map that out. our book value per share growth, i believe it’ s more than double the next nearest competitor . and so we are going to continue to stay focused on the medium and long-term. i think we are good at nimbly making adjustments, and we will always be very clear to have when we get things right or we get things wrong.",4,2022
0,10,Jim Mitchell,question,question," hey. good morning. maybe just your thoughts on the outlook for investment banking, i appreciate denis’  comments, we have seen a big increase in debt issuance, so some improving liquidity in the debt markets at least. is that, in your mind, a leading indicator for beginning to monetize backlogs? and just generally , how are you thinking about the outlook for investment banking? thanks.",4,2022
1,10,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. sure. i think that – i think one of the things we are dealing with and it’ s over- ampliﬁed in our very capital market-centric business is that 2021 was not normal. the second half of 2020 and 2021 were not normal. they were way inﬂated by the massive ﬁscal stimulus that created kind of, i would call, on the spectrum of activity , excess activity , pulled a lot of activity forward. and then because of market disruption, we have tightened monetary conditions meaningfully in 2022. it’ s the ﬁrst year in over 50 years that both ﬁxed income and equity markets were down. w e had the s&p  down 20%, the nasdaq down 30%. you had a real change in asset values across the spectrum. and when that happens, it takes a period of time for people to adjust. my historical experience would be that period of time is kind of four quarters to six quarters. and so if you think about it, if somebody had a stock that was trading at $100 and the stock goes down by 30%, certainly , for the next couple of quarters, they are still thinking about $100. but if it’ s at $70 for four quarters or ﬁve quarters, six quarters, then it’ s $70. and suddenly , when you look ahead and you think about either an m&a  transaction or ﬁnancing, you have more realism about the reset of values. so, i think we are well into that journey of a reset and expectations. i think it might have another quarter or two quarters to further reset, but i think we are starting to see some additional improvements, people point to the investment-grade debt market. that would obviously be where it would come ﬁrst. but my expectations would be in the back half of ‘23 meaningfully better . and also, it’ s interesting, and i will be heading to dallas tonight with others, but i was watching some of the commentary , the macro commentary . people are softening their view of 2023. and i would say it’ s getting a little bit more dovish, a little bit more of a softer landing than kind of where people were a quarter or two quarters ago. and that too, will af fect capital markets opportunity because it’ s really tied to conﬁdence. so, i think we are going through that. i don’t think anything has fundamentally changed. i think these capital markets businesses are still very big businesses. but you shouldn’t look at 2022 as normal, just as you shouldn’t look at 2021 is normal. they normalized somewhere in the middle.",4,2022
2,10,Jim Mitchell,question,question," right. and maybe just a follow-up on the reserve and provisioning. that’ s obviously been a big drag in proﬁtability as you grow the platform business. but as you shrink marcus, is there also any desire to kind of slow . i know greensky is growing on balance sheet, but the rest of the business is that slow? do we start to see provisioning slow and given how high your reserve levels already are? just trying to get a better picture on how to think about that cadence and maybe where your macro assumptions are in your reserve levels?",4,2022
3,10,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so, as it relates to slowing growth, we actually did slow origination activity over the course of the fourth quarter . over the course of the year , we have implemented a number of changes to our credit underwriting, tightening some of those provisions. and so we actually did see a slowing of new originations. that being said, the vast majority of the provision build was attributable to the existing balances as opposed to the new originations. so, that’ s also something that we are going to watch very carefully as things develop. you notice our overall coverage ratio increasing. that’ s a function of what we have observed in our portfolio, but as well as our macroeconomic outlook. and so we have made some adjustments, which reﬂect our best estimates for performance in the economy going forward.",4,2022
0,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," hi. thanks very much. it's a tough one because you are deﬁnitely executing on a lot of the objectives you laid out. and of course, the sustainability of banking is what it is. i noticed your lower pipeline. but the real question i have is, the sustainability of the whole package, meaning, you just had really strong revenue across the board on everything. comp was up with that normally , but non-comp is down, the provision is down and r wa didn't increase even though you were growing your ﬁnancing. so i'm giving you a softball here and just saying, what of that package can continue to stick?",1,2024
1,0,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, i appreciate it, glenn. and i think there are a bunch of things that continue to stick because one of the things you know that we've been focused on is building a more durable business and that there are a handful of things when you look across the whole package. w e've made signiﬁcant progress over the course of the last ﬁve years. certainly , building our ﬁnancing business in our markets business is something that's more durable and more sustainable. w e still think there's lots of room to grow . and look, the world is growing and when the world grows and our clients grow , they need us to ﬁnance them. w e've got the capital to deploy as long as we can drive attractive returns with that client base. and so we stay focused on that. we've doubled our management fees on our asset & w ealth management business over the last ﬁve years and we continue to be very focused on fundraising, our ability to deliver on that. those are more durable revenues. and there's operating leverage around that business that we still think we have yet to achieve. you've seen the margin improvement obviously in that business, but that business still has a higher capital density than we'd like that business to have and we continue to focus on our historical principal investments and making progress there. overall, i think, we've meaningfully improved the client franchise and taken wallet share, and we're just very , very focused on our relative participation in the market opportunity that exists with our big institutional clients. and we've said over the course of the last few years and there have been lots of questions on it, are those wallet shares sticky? i think the wallet shares are. what i can't tell you for sure is what the opportunity set is on every quarter-to- quarter . but when you look at the breadth, the leadership position, the global nature of these businesses and you look at the whole package, these are durable businesses that produce accretive returns where we're very well-positioned. and we continue to focus on executing and enhancing that position.",1,2024
2,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question, i deﬁnitely appreciate all that. can we talk just follow up on just the non-comp piece and talk -- you had some big drops in amortization and depreciation and some marketing and stuf f. so are those at actually run-rate levels now going forward also because that was a nice positive surprise?,1,2024
3,0,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," good morning, glenn. it's dennis. as we've said over the last number of quarters, we've been very , very focused on non-comp and containing the growth of non-comp. there clearly are inﬂationary pressures that impact a number of items in our non- comp expense. the sharp decrease sequentially we're pleased with, as well as the year-over-year decrease, but there were a number of items over the course of last year that we didn't necessarily expect to repeat. and so it's good to get on to a more normalized operating trajectory with respect to our non-comp expense base, but it's something we're going to remain very , very focused on managing in a disciplined fashion. but i think this quarter is a much more normal quarter than some of the preceding quarters.",1,2024
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," good morning. i guess i just wanted to follow up, david. you mentioned ai and would love this -- it's hard in our seats to ﬁgure out what's hype, what's real. if you can double-click on some of the comments you made around comparing what's going on with ai today versus maybe the dotcom bubble around the runway this might create for capital markets, ib, not just for this year , but beyond? and then also the other side around, is there line-of-sight of how much more efﬁcient goldman itself can get by deploying ai? thank you.",1,2024
1,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. so, i mean, big picture and look, i'm not a stock picker , so i'm not going to comment when you make a comparison to the internet explosion in 1999, 2000, 2001, i'm not going to comment around that. i think we have -- we've got a lot of stock market capitalization that's being driven by big platforms that i think have an enormous competitive advantage around the scaling of these technologies. but broadly speaking, these technologies require certain things, including infrastructure, power , and these things require ﬁnancing to drive the scale that's going to be necessary for people to execute on the investments that they see as important to keep their businesses competitive at pace. and that is creating an ecosystem of activity in our investment banking and markets business that we've seen in the context of other areas of signiﬁcant shift or macro expansion over a long period of time. so i actually think there's a very , very constructive runway of opportunity set for us with our clients as people reposition their businesses, and we're talking about a level of scale that is candidly unprecedented. and so i think that opportunity is something over the course, this is not a quarter-to-quarter thing, this is over the next ﬁve to 10 years and we're very , very focused on it and very engaged. and by the way , it's not just companies, it's governments, obviously that are making enormous investments in bringing infrastructure into their locale. and so all of this is something that we're very strategically focused on. double-clicking and getting more narrowly focused on goldman sachs, i would just say we see enormous opportunities for productivity gains and also opportunities for efﬁciency . our use cases that we're testing and that we're implementing focus on those two areas. but i'd really like the focus to be more on productivity and the ability to scale our smartest people to do more with our clients rather than expecting an efﬁciency gain that becomes very cost accretive. i think one of the most important things for this ﬁrm and the success of this ﬁrm is the time our people spend with clients, serving our clients, executing for our clients, and these tools give us more productivity , and also when we look at our datasets and what we have internally and ability to deliver them a value-added package of information, thought process that we think can be dif ferentiated. and so we're very focused on the productivity side, although, of course, we have analog systems and processes where there will be efﬁciency and we're also focused on bringing those to bear when we look at our overall cost structure.",1,2024
2,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," that's good color . thank you. and just separately , for the goldman stock, right, i think from an investor standpoint, a lot of focus on how quickly we can grow the share of asset management. you've talked about the hpis coming down, alt assets going up. is -- how else should shareholders and prospective investors think about strategy around growing the asset management revenues and is inorganic growth at all part of the strategy and in terms of how management is thinking about things today? thank you.",1,2024
3,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," so we -- in january , we said to you, we thought high single-digit growth with margin improvement and less capital density over time. w e're executing on that. w e are very focused at the moment on our organic execution. firm obviously generates a lot of capital. there could be a time in the future where something might come up that could be interesting and could accelerate that pace in the overall mix. but at the moment, our focus is on the execution of what we have in front of us and we are making good progress. but i think we put out a handful of metrics, both in terms of top-line growth, our ability to continue to fundraise, you saw that we highlighted $15 billion of fundraising in alternatives in the ﬁrst quarter . we said we expect to raise $40 billion to $50 billion this quarter -- this year . obviously , the $15 billion keeps us on pace for the $40 billion to $50 billion we said we could raise this year. that doesn't stop this year . we think we have a very strong fundraising machine that can continue for a number of years going forward. so we're focused on the things that matter in asset management. what matters? performance matters, client experience matters. w e're incredibly focused on both those things and working hard to make sure we use our global scale and the depth that we have around the world to execute very -- very ef fectively .",1,2024
0,2,Christian Bolu,question,question," good morning, guys. maybe i'll ask glenn's question in a dif ferent way . if i look at that 18% roe for the global bank and the markets business, it really -- it really catches my eye here. so how would you characterize this quarter's performance? is it like sort of normal-ish to you? does it feel maybe peak-ish to you? again just trying to ﬁgure out if 18% roe is anywhere sustainable for that business.",1,2024
1,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," that was -- it was a -- it was -- there's no way to shade this. it was a strong quarter for global banking and markets. peak, i mean, i can point in the last few years to quarters in global banking and markets where the returns were higher . but i certainly wouldn't say that this is what we expect to be an average quarter in global banking and markets. w e've said clearly , we think this is a mid-teens business through the cycle. the performance this quarter was higher . there were performance last year was meaningfully lower . i think the right thing to focus on, christian, is mid- teens through the cycle. that's the way we think about it. and there was client activity and opportunity set for us this quarter and i think one of the things that we continue to try to talk about is that when there is opportunity with our clients, there is opportunity in the market. w e're good at capturing that, delivering that for shareholders. and then when the environment is more tough though, this is a more durable and sustainable business than people may have looked at the past. but i would view this as a very strong quarter on global banking and markets and not what we would target as the average run-rate for the business.",1,2024
2,2,Christian Bolu,question,question," okay . that's very helpful. maybe on to private wealth, if i'm reading slide 9 correctly , you had something like $17 billion of inﬂows into w ealth management aus. so that would equate to something like 9% organic growth, which is well above peers, i would call it best-in-class. so can you give more color on what's driving that growth? maybe any color by regions or products as to what's resonating with clients? and again, longer-term, how are you thinking about sustainability of that level of organic growth?",1,2024
3,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. again, this i think comes down to focus and you know we made some very -- we talked about conscious decisions. w e have talked about broadening our w ealth platform to get much more broadly into what i'd call kind of high net-worth w ealth management. and with the sale of united capital, we continue to be very focused on our ultra-high net-worth platform. it is an extraordinary platform. i do think it's a best- in-class platform. i do think that the ultra-high net-worth business is still a very fragmented business. while we have leading share, i think those shares are still on a global basis, a leader is a single-digit share. there's a lot of wealth in the world, there's a lot of wealth accumulating. but we are very , very well-positioned to continue to capture that secular trend. and i think the business is performing very , very well. so, our alts franchise, i think is dif ferentiated and we're allowed to deliver alts in an effective way to wealth clients. i think that's something that gives us a strong secular tailwind. w e're expanding our private banking activity . that's not something that we have been focused on, which i think is also strengthening our position as a wealth manager . so, i think there's a good runway for this business. i do think it's a best-in- class franchise that has room to grow . and i think you're seeing it perform well and we're very focused on it. i think the sharp decision around how we're going to focus this business, i think we're beneﬁting from at the moment.",1,2024
4,2,Christian Bolu,question,question, great. thank you.,1,2024
0,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question, hi. good morning. can you hear me okay?,1,2024
1,3,David Solomon,answer,answer," good morning, betsy .",1,2024
2,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer, good morning.,1,2024
3,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question, okay . all right. great. just want to make sure.,1,2024
4,3,David Solomon,answer,answer, we can hear you ﬁne. thank you.,1,2024
5,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question," all right. thanks. so, just two follow-ups. one, i heard all the commentary about how the 1q is run rate a little bit better than run rate on average over time. but it doesn't take away from the fact that 1q was very strong. and i just wanted to understand, was there anything that we should understand about the revenues in equities and ﬁxed income, for example, that were dif ferent this quarter? and the reason i ask is, var efﬁciency was so strong, right? you've delivered very strong trading revenues on var that was, you know , basically ﬂat q-on-q. i mean, a little down, a little up, depending on which asset -- which asset class you're looking at. so, was there anything in the -- in -- when you mentioned, you stepped into client activity and opportunity set, was there anything unique about that opportunity set that enabled you to do this in a way that didn't really tag v ar at all?",1,2024
6,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so, betsy , it's denis. nice to hear from you.",1,2024
7,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question, thanks.,1,2024
8,3,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," look, to give you some color on that, i wouldn't point to any particular discrete item. i would say the revenue generation, the activity was broad-based. but in addition to the consequence of the focus on market share and wallet share that we've made across the client franchise over time, we also did see good opportunities to risk intermediate on behalf of clients across geographies, across asset classes. and i would observe that over the course of the quarter , it was just a very benign operating environment. credit spreads were tightening, equity valuations were going up, and that provides a tailwind to our performance across portions of our global banking and markets business as well. the ﬁrst quarter is obviously often seasonally strong as well. so we think we really captured a lot of the opportunity that was presented by both the environment and our client engagement. and as david said, that may not necessarily be the case each and every quarter , particularly in ficc and equities. so, when we talk about like a global banking and markets segment overall, clearly more upside across banking, but a strong performance across both ficc and equities in q1.",1,2024
9,3,Betsy Graseck,question,question," super . that's really helpful. thanks for the incremental color there. just one other follow-up. david, you mentioned you're able to deliver alts in a unique way to the wealth platform that you've got. could you just give us a little more color as to what you're thinking about there that we should understand? thanks so much.",1,2024
10,3,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. i think one of the things that our w ealth management franchise ﬁnds very attractive is, we want an open platform. and so when it comes to alts, we obviously have a very , very broad, very , very deep, very , very unique of fering as one of the top ﬁve or six alts providers on an integrated basis in the world with our own products, what we're manufacturing out of our asset management business. but in addition, we want an open platform where we deliver them access to alternative solutions and products from all dif ferent world-class managers around the world across the spectrum. and so i think that's a very , very unique of fering that very , very afﬂuent people who wealth manage at goldman sachs ﬁnd super attractive and super differentiated.",1,2024
0,4,Brennan Hawken,question,question," good morning. thanks for taking my question. so i wanted to ask one on your m&a franchise. so the recovery in announced m&a  has been really impressive, but really kind of dominated by strategic, and given your strong franchise among sponsors, i'm curious to get an update about what you're seeing among that cohort and maybe when you might expect we will see a ramp in announcements from the sponsor side.",1,2024
1,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. brennan, that's -- i appreciate that question. and that's a sharp observation on your part. the sponsor activity is still muted, but i would say it's deﬁnitely picking up. the engagement with sponsors in the quarter was meaningfully improved. and as i've said before, sponsors make money both for themselves and for their investors by buying things and selling things. and the level of activity has been incredibly muted. and when you look at the lp  community , the lp  community is putting a lot of pressure on the ﬁnancial sponsor community to return more capital and increase the velocity of capital return. and so i do think the pace is going to pick up in the coming quarters. i'd say the activity and interaction and engagement is higher in the ﬁrst quarter than it was throughout 2023. but i would say it's still operating at lower levels. there's a lot of upside for our business. our business is very correlated to a pickup in sponsor activity . and so to the degree that it did pick up, that would be a very big tailwind for our business across banking and markets broadly . when i look at our leveraged ﬁnance deals book, it's still operating at historically very , very low levels. we feel fortunate that we've got a good amount of capital ﬂexibility . that was to accelerate to deploy which is obviously very accretive and attractive business. w e're not seeing it really accelerate yet, but i think it's coming. and certainly , the sustained level we've had over the -- the level we've had over the course of the last 12 to 18 months is not sustainable. it will pick up. it's just a question of when. and so that is a potential tailwind for our business in future quarters.",1,2024
2,4,Brennan Hawken,question,question," great. thanks. thanks for that color , david. i appreciate it. and then another question on alts. so, fundraising looks really good. i know there can be some noise in the revenue. so, just curious about the alts revenue down year-over-year and the aus only up sort of marginally sequentially . could you give some color around what was happening in those lines and maybe any potential noise?",1,2024
3,4,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. brennan, it's denis. so, a couple of things. obviously , the movement in aus is a function of how we fundraise, how we deploy , and overall levels. w e have had a lot of success fundraising, not just in the last quarter at $14 billion, but now with the whole $265 billion-plus since the original investor day . but there is a lag in terms of when some of that capital is put to use and actually moves into aus. not all of our funds that are raised are aus-ing immediately . so i think that is something you can look out for in future periods. and then in terms of some of the sequentials on alts, as david was walking through our platform, our w ealth platform in terms of having goldman sachs proprietary funds, also open architecture, and third-party platform, some of the alts fees we generate in raising capital for other managers on our platform, and if we look over the sequential period, we had less by way of placement fees associated with those capital raises in the ﬁrst quarter than we did in the fourth quarter last year .",1,2024
0,5,Mike Mayo,question,question," hi. david, you reiterated the desire for goldman to have a more narrow strategic focus, but you still have some cleanup from the past charges this quarter for greensky , the gm card, platform solutions still lost $1 17 million. so i'm just trying to ﬁgure out in this context where transaction banking stands. i mean, you had 8% year-over-year growth. so, that's decent. but three years ago, march 1st, you guys said transaction banking, you're building global payments around the world. and then march 8th of this year on bloomberg, it says that you're closed in japan and now you're focusing on the us and europe. so on the one hand, are you simply pulling back your ambitions? on the other hand, maybe you have more ﬁnancial discipline. you're making sure these adjacent activities are generating proﬁts instead of just growth.",1,2024
1,5,David Solomon,answer,answer," look, mike, i think you summarized it well. i think it's yes to a bunch of the things that you said. w e're looking hard -- we are -- i think it's very important for me to say that we're very committed to transaction banking. w e think we've got very , very good technology and a good platform that we can grow and continue to scale over time. but there's no question we're very focused on making sure that we execute appropriately and that it's not just top-line growth that it delivers proﬁtability . it's something that sits in our client franchise and adds to the portfolio of things that we can bring to our clients. i think some of the ambitions might have been too broad in terms of our ability to execute immediately . and so we've narrowed that, but we remain committed, focused, and growing. and i think this is a medium and longer- term project that we will deliver on. it's small, but i think we've got the right focus. w e made a hire to bolster the expertise in the leadership and we're moving forward on that strategy . and with respect to the cleanup, we continue to narrow and cleanup. the after-tax loss from the platforms was less than $100 million. w e've said clearly that we believe that we can bring the platforms to breakeven or proﬁtability in 2025 and we're executing against that.",1,2024
2,5,Mike Mayo,question,question," just to follow up on the transaction banking. you said some ambitions were too broad. again, it's better to have proﬁtable growth than just growth. so, point acknowledged. but what happened? i mean, where were you kind of underestimating expenses or the build-out costs or what was more difﬁcult than you had anticipated?",1,2024
3,5,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, i think there were a number of things, mike, that came together . i think when you're building new businesses, you give authority to the people that are building those businesses and you create metrics and you hold people accountable as you advance. and i think there were things where we thought we could do more globally and candidly when we really looked at the cost of executing and delivering, there was more friction in that context. and so we've chosen to narrow some of that in terms of the global footprint of that. that doesn't mean later there might not be opportunity to do it, but we think for now , that's the right action. i'd say secondarily , the regulatory environment changed massively and has also raised the bar and created headwinds in a dif ferent lens with which we look at the expansion of these kinds of activities. and so that's something else that went into the mix. and so look, i think one of the things that we try to do is to look at everything with facts, with data, with information to be unemotional and to be willing to say , okay , this isn't exactly right. so we're going to adjust. and i think we're showing that we're willing to adjust and make adjustments always with a goal of growing the ﬁrm and delivering for shareholders, driving proﬁtable businesses that deliver accretive returns for shareholders. w e'll get some things right, we'll get some things wrong. but when we look at the information of the data and it's not exactly perfect, we'll adjust.",1,2024
0,6,Steven Chubak,question,question," hey, good morning. so, wanted to follow up, david, on --",1,2024
1,6,Denis Coleman,answer,answer, good morning.,1,2024
2,6,David Solomon,answer,answer, good morning.,1,2024
3,6,Steven Chubak,question,question," good morning, guys. w anted to follow up, david, with the earlier discussion just on sponsor-related activity . private credit fundraising remains robust, but the syndicated markets are also reopening. just wanted to better understand what you're seeing in terms of competition in syndicated versus private markets, how it's impacting your ib&o franchises. and just given some of the recent price coverage, maybe just speak to your growth ambitions in the private credit space more broadly .",1,2024
4,6,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. i'm going to -- i'll make a couple of comments, but i'm going to ask denis to comment too because as you know , denis -- denis ran these businesses for us for an extended period of time. but i'd just say ﬁrst, the narrative that in some way , shape or form, this is -- this is about the syndicated market versus the private market, i think is an oversimpliﬁcation. as transaction volumes increase, particularly in the sponsor community , the amount of activity that will come out of the syndicated market will obviously increase meaningfully . we're very well-positioned for that. w e are one of the largest players in that and that area is operating at cyclical lows at the moment. but that's going to continue to be a very , very important part of capital formation and it's not going away . the growth in private credit will continue. i think we're very well-positioned for that. w e have about $130 billion of private credit assets, which makes us one of the largest players. i've said publicly , we have aspirations to continue to invest and grow , and we see a number of places where we can do that. w e're very focused on that. i do think it's important to highlight that we've not been through a credit cycle in a very long time. and so while there are lots of private credit players that continue to grow and expand, how those platforms and those businesses will respond when we do go through a credit cycle and we will go through a credit cycle, is a little bit unclear at the moment. but i think strategically , we're in a very , very interesting position because we have the ability to marry for our clients both our capabilities in the syndicated market and also our private credit capabilities. and you can see that. i mean, i can point to a transaction that was done in the last -- in the last few months we did just that. and in fact, it wasn't just in credit, it was in equity too, you can look at the endeavor transaction and you can look at our ability to participate and lead both as a syndicated lender , but also as a capital provider across the capital structure for our investors as an example of the way that i think that our franchise and our platform is dif ferentiated. denis, do you want to add anything to those comments?",1,2024
5,6,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. i think it's well-covered. i mean, i think there was -- there's been a lot of discussion over the past of the -- past year of sort of private credit versus syndicated alternative, but the reality is, the syndicated alternative didn't really exist. and so it was really just a discussion around private credit. with ﬁrst quarter activity levels, you now see a viable, functioning, and healthy syndicated loan market. the vast majority of the activity was actually reﬁnancing. a lot of that reﬁnancing was reﬁnancing private credit capital structures with the more attractive pricing available in the broad-based syndicated market. so the reality is, these are all just forms of credit made available to dif ferent borrowers. and over time, i think there'll be a much more normalized mix where you'll see underwritten as well as directly lent solutions, in some cases, existing in the same capital structure. and i think we're just in a healthier environment, but from goldman sachs' perspective is positive because the data points that we now see across the leverage lending market make sponsor estimated weighted-average cost of capital much more observable and that should unlock their ability to start to price and put together transactions that should fuel some incremental sponsor-related change of control activity . so, i think the sort of two markets functioning side-by-side is good in terms of activity and what it means on the forward for goldman sachs.",1,2024
6,6,Steven Chubak,question,question," really helpful color . and for my follow-up, just on capital management. cet1 continues to build, you're well in excess of the regulatory minimums, the direction of travel on basel iii in terms of expectations around the proposal is certainly more favorable. at the same time, it now looks like you might be more constrained by the slr, which declined to 5.4%. i know that's never intended to be the binding constraint, but i was hoping you could just speak to how you're managing to leverage constraint, which at least appears to be binding at the moment, and what we should expect in terms of the pace of buyback and whether that actually informs your expectation there.",1,2024
7,6,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thanks, steven. so, yes, you're right on all counts. obviously , we have a variety of both capital and liquidity ratios that we manage to over time. the slr is a slower-moving ratio as you know , but our bindingness can move back and forth between various ratios over time. and we have a bunch of levers that we can pull with respect to our activities to manage that. but i appreciate the question.",1,2024
0,7,Devin Ryan,question,question," great. thanks so much. the ﬁrst question just on kind of maybe a bigger picture on the wallet share in markets. i know this has really been ongoing work for the ﬁrm and obviously , not just the quarter , but really the past few years, this has been pretty consistent story . so, if we kind of move aside ﬁnancing, love to maybe just drill down on some of the individual products that are accelerating in equities and ficc and where you're most pleased with the execution that has occurred over the last several years and then still where you see the biggest room to close any gaps that are maybe still there. thanks.",1,2024
1,7,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, at a high level, and this was one of the things that we observed and i think we got right over a period of time, that we started with the top 100, we're now focused on the top 150 clients in this business. the top 150 clients provide a very signiﬁcant portion of all the activity in this franchise. and so your share with them and managing the share with them has a big impact on your wallet shares. i think the thing that we've done well and that we see is really the case is that they all operate across all products and all activities and all silos and the ability to create a very seamless experience for them across the ﬁrm is a big change for us versus where we might have been a decade ago. and so it's something we're very focused on. there are times when there's more activity in commodities, there's time when there's more activity in credit, there's time when there's more activity in mortgages. it moves and it ebbs and ﬂows, but what we're really trying to do is to make sure we have the full package to serve them in the most ef fective way and we've made real progress in that over the course of the last couple of years. i think the opportunity for us to continue to make progress comes from the fact that in the top 150, i think we stand at slightly under top three with 1 17 of them, don't hold me to that number exactly . it's probably , okay , 117 of them. so, obviously , we have progress to make because there's no reason why goldman sachs shouldn't be top three with the overwhelming majority much closer to 90% of those 150. and also when you look at top three, there are also clients where we're third, where we absolutely should be ﬁrst or second. and so we continue to drill down. w e continue to go, talk to our clients, listen to our clients, get feedback on how we can do a better job serving them. and that discipline and that rigor , i think is helping us execute for them, but there's more work to do and we don't take our position for granted. w e try to create the right culture of focus and intensity that allows us to continue to deliver and execute both.",1,2024
2,7,Devin Ryan,question,question," yes. okay . great. thanks, david. maybe a quick follow-up here for denis. just on the equity investments line, not a great quarter there, not a drag either . it feels like it's been some time since we've seen maybe a more normal quarter without big puts and takes. and so just given the reconstitution of that book, how would you frame what a more normal quarter should look like from a revenue perspective? and then how the private portfolio is positioned if we are moving into a better exit environment. obviously , it's been tough there as well. thanks.",1,2024
3,7,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thanks for the question. so, a couple of things, and may have been embedded in your question. but obviously looking at some of the -- on the progress in the equity investments line on a sequential basis. just a reminder that in q4 when we sold personal financial management, that was reﬂected as a gain in equity investments of about $350 million that did not repeat. so that will give you some -- some insight into how that's trending sequentially . on a year-over-year basis, we are seeing performance in the private portfolio, sort of in line with what you're suggesting we might expect. and what we did see a particular markdown in the public portfolio that sort of netted into the ultimate equity investment results. w e also, as you know , have been -- have focused on selling down a portion of our historical principal investments. so a combination of the ultimate size of the notional remaining in our portfolio combined with what the market conditions are, will obviously contribute -- contribute to the ultimate performance. the other guidance that we've put out there generally , medium-term guidance is that across both equity and debt investments, you're looking at a number of about $2 billion on a year . so you could put that in the quarter , about $500 million. those are some pieces of color i'd give you.",1,2024
0,8,Matt O'Connor,question,question," good morning. actually , just to follow up on the last question and comment, the run- off of the historical principal investment from the $15 billion here, the $2 billion that you just referenced, is that the run-of f that you expect, or was that alluding to the revenues per year?",1,2024
1,8,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thanks. let me clarify . i was making a comment with respect to revenue and then separately as it relates to the rundown of that portfolio, i guess the way to think of it, picking up questions from last earnings and/or this one. the progress that we made in the ﬁrst quarter of roughly $1.5 billion, we think that's decent assumption for the pace over the course of this year . and then we just reiterated our commitment to selling down substantially all of it in line with our target.",1,2024
2,8,Matt O'Connor,question,question, okay . so $1.5 billion per quarter is what you're implying from here for the rest of the year?,1,2024
3,8,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," on the historical principal investment portfolio, yes, we would expect something roughly in line with $1.5 billion per quarter for the balance of the year .",1,2024
0,9,Saul Martinez,question,question," hi. thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to ask about your ﬁnancing business in markets. and obviously , there's uncertainty about the basel end-game proposal. as you mentioned, the direction of travel seems to be for it to be materially lightened or even re-proposed. but one of the areas where it is very punitive versus other jurisdictions is in securities ﬁnancing, the risk weightings for unlisted entities. and if that part of the proposal isn't materially altered, it doesn't seem like it necessarily is a focus, does that impact your ability to grow your ﬁnancing revenues? is it a threat? is it not a big deal? can you of fset it through pricing, product design? just curious if you can provide a little color on that.",1,2024
1,9,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so, obviously , where basel iii ends up and which components of the rule actually are put in place and how they're drafted and how they're calculated, et cetera, will be highly determinative. but i'd say the breadth of our ﬁnancing activities across both ficc and equity are much broader than that particular component. and we expect that the underlying demand from our clients for ﬁnancing across both ficc and equities will remain high. w e have leading market shares and capabilities there. so we'll expect to be able to deliver in that regard. and depending on where various pieces of regulation end up, we'll make whatever adjustments we need, either to pricing or the mix of our businesses or look for other ways to serve our clients.",1,2024
2,9,Saul Martinez,question,question," okay . thanks. that's helpful. and then maybe just following up on basel and the implications of it being softened, denis, you mentioned more ﬂexibility on capital deployment, if given the direction of travel on basel. i mean, how should we be thinking about buyback activity from here? you did $1.5 billion. is there -- do you feel like there is scope to increase that and potentially bring your payout ratio even closer to 100% of earnings?",1,2024
3,9,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. i appreciate the question. w e were deliberate in our script remarks about the degree of capital ﬂexibility that we expected, but also pick up on something that david said earlier on the call, which is that we remain very committed to our capital deployment hierarchy , which starts with our client franchise. and some of the activities where historically we've been able to deploy capital have been less active. and so we have a good amount of cushion and ﬂexibility at this point in time. as our clients become more active, the ﬁrst place that we're going to look to deploy our capital is to support our clients and their activities. and after that, we would, of course, as you note, continue to be focused on a sustainable and growing dividend. and only after that would we think about return of capital.",1,2024
0,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," i appreciate your macro comments. i was wondering, in private markets speciﬁcally , i feel like those markets have changed as well or hopefully only temporary , but great time to be a private lender in private credit. and you're big in that, but not as a great time to be in private equity for marks or capital raising. so i wonder if you could talk as both manufacturer and distributor , just maybe a state of the union in general and then if you could weave that into your thoughts on your gross alternative fundraising target of $225 billion and $2 billion in management fees.",3,2022
1,0,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. so thanks for the question, glenn. and look, at a high level, the targets remain in place. and our conﬁdence in the targets and our ability to deliver those targets is high, and we're very focused on them. w e continue to make progress in the fundraising, and we highlighted it in the context of the script. and we have a series of offerings that are coming over the course of the next 18 months. and while certainly i'd say that private equity fundraising environment is more constrained and the alternative fundraising environment is broadly more constrained, i would highlight just the fact that we have a very , very broad franchise, a very , very diverse sense of of fering at -- sets of of ferings and that there's a lot of opportunity that comes out of an environment like this. and i actually think from a vintage perspective, the opportunity to put money to work in this environment when we look forward and then when we look back, it's probably something that will be very , very attractive. we're obviously shifting the macro environment, as we've talked about. that's going to create headwinds around valuations, and there's been a big reset. on the other hand, if you have dry powder or you have interesting strategies -- you highlighted some. i think lending strategies will be quite attractive in this environment. i think there's good institutional capital and, candidly , good capital out of the wealth channel still available to support these strategies. so we're taking a long-term approach to growing these businesses. the businesses are growing nicely . we've set targets that we'll continue to meet. and i know that if we have a good broad of fering for our clients, that we'll continue to have success in this. and candidly , this is one of the reasons why we're integrating asset and w ealth management is as we believe by putting these platforms together , we have the best eye and the best breadth to really understand where the opportunities are to serve our clients and also where the opportunities are for good performance.",3,2022
2,0,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," and glenn, i can add from an alternatives perspective, we mentioned growth of $12 billion in new commitments in the quarter . that brings year-to-date to $57 billion, just shy of $60 billion. w e now sit at $164 billion towards our increased $225 billion target. w e continue to migrate our alternatives into aus that sits now at $256 billion of alternatives aus. so despite the environment, we continue to make progress towards our fundraising goals, particularly in alternatives.",3,2022
3,0,Glenn Schorr,question,question," thanks for that, denis, and david. maybe a related follow-up on r wa. is that a little bit in the quarter? i appreciate you took share and lots of volatility , so that has a bunch of moving parts. but curious your just overall approach towards optimizing rwa. and then maybe a speciﬁc question related to ficc ﬁnancing. and it was up 41%. it's great, making good money . does that come at paying better or worse return on risk-weighted assets as intermediation?",3,2022
4,0,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," glenn, thank you -- thanks for the question on r wa. as you note, our r was were down slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis. w e have been focused on managing our r wa footprint tightly . within that number , you'll see reductions in terms of market-based r was and increases in credit r was. and we're being very thoughtful about the way in which we allocate and deploy r wa capacity to drive efﬁciencies as well as scale franchise growth activities. and ficc ﬁnancing happens to represent an attractive opportunity in terms of our r wa deployment. and so that's one of the reasons why you see the ongoing focus in the growth of the ficc ﬁnancing line.",3,2022
0,1,Steven Chubak,question,question, so wanted to start with a question on expenses. you spoke of expense mitigation efforts as part of the broader realignment strategy . what's the level of non-comp inﬂation we should be contemplating? recognizing we're still dealing with inﬂationary headwinds. you alluded to more proactive measures to mitigate expense growth. just want to get a sense if the goal is to actually slow non-comp growth or to deliver absolute reductions in expense.,3,2022
1,1,David Solomon,answer,answer," thanks for the question, steven. i'll start at just a high level, and then denis will go to the details with you in terms of how we're thinking about it. but i do think there are different factors that are leading to the expense growth, but one is there is deﬁnitely an inﬂationary pressure that's af fecting certain aspects of the business. w e're obviously looking at that and thinking about that carefully . i do think we're making investments across the platform, particularly in certain technology infrastructure, and that's having an impact in the medium-term. w e think those are investments that we need to make. at the same point, though, given the environment, we're extremely focused on trying to mitigate any expense growth to the degree we can. now there are going to be headwinds given the natural inﬂation that sets in, but why don't i have denis kind of walk through and break down some of the dif ferent components that we've been focused on?",3,2022
2,1,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. so if we take a step back, we look at our overall level of operating expenses year-to-date, they're down 6% compared to the prior year-to-date period. they are up 1% sequentially , drivers obviously across both comp and non-comp. if you look at the non-compensation growth over the course of the last year , roughly half of that is attributable to expenses associated with the integration and run rate of nnip  and greensky together with change in litigation. so that is representing about half. on the balance, as david indicated, we do see some impact from inﬂation. w e do see the impact of higher levels of transaction-based expenses, but we are also taking actions to reduce expenses within the overall non-compensation category where we can. you may note that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we reduced our professional fees, something that we indicated in our previous earnings release. and we're going to continue to think very , very disciplined about the way in which we deploy non-compensation expenditures striking the balance of driving towards our efﬁciency ratio but as well as making the investments that we think are appropriate to continue to strengthen and grow the ﬁrm.",3,2022
3,1,Steven Chubak,question,question," that's great. and maybe just a question for my follow-up on the equity investment portfolio. given the challenging equity market backdrop, certainly , the revenues came in better than expected. there's also been some increased scrutiny more favorable marks on some of these private equity portfolios. and just given the better revenue outcome and a pretty heavy concentration in areas like tmt and real estate, which have come under pressure, i was hoping you could speak to what drove some of the better results this quarter , anything idiosyncratic worth ﬂagging?",3,2022
4,1,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thank you, steven. let me cover that in a bit of detail for you. so obviously , on the $527 million equity line, there's a number of components. as we mentioned previously , we have a public equity portfolio, and that contributed positively north of $200 million for the third quarter . and then also within the private portfolio, you have a number of things that are going on within our private equity portfolio. w e have roughly $0.5 billion of event-driven gains that came through over the course of the third quarter , whether those be capital raising activities, strategic transactions or the operating expenses from our cies, those positive gains were of fset by markdowns in our private equity portfolio, particularly in tmt and consumer .",3,2022
0,2,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," i guess maybe just going back, david, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about rationalize spend. the segment realignment makes a ton of sense. just give us a sense from the outside as we think about the rationalization of the spend, does this lead to you achieving your strategic targets around costs, roe at a faster pace? or do you have a high degree of conﬁdence that you get there relative to the previous plan and understanding the core tenants are the same? but just give us a sense of just your conﬁdence in achieving those targets despite the market backdrop as we look forward and how does the alignment supports that?",3,2022
1,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," sure. and so ﬁrst, i just want to amplify , i said in the script, we continue to be committed to our forward targets. and there's nothing about the environment or the way we're running the ﬁrm that doesn't lead us to believe that we can deliver on the targets that we would set over the course of the coming years, whether the return target or also the efﬁciency target that we've set. and we're tracking a number of kpis and continue to be very focused on that. the realignment of the ﬁrm is really driven by our ability to serve clients. that is the most important thing that's coming out of this. and we've been very , very focused on wallet share and client share broadly . we've made real improvements over the last few years, and we think this further aligns those goals and that capability . now in this realignment, we are making a purposeful shift as we think about our direct-to-consumer business. and i'd just highlight that one of the things that changes by aligning our direct-to-consumer business with our wealth business and people that are on our wealth platform is that the forward spend for customer acquisition is meaningfully lower . and so of course, as you look at that, that's helpful in the overall returns of the ﬁrm. but i would highlight that just the numbers, either way we were looking at it are small in the context of businesses, our core businesses, banking and markets, asset and wealth management. and i don't think any of this was having a big impact on our ability to meet our targets or the pace at which we will meet our targets. w e do think, and this is why we're doing this, that this is a better way for us to align the business and move the business forward. and so that's why we've made this purposeful shift. but again, i'd just amplify , these are not big numbers in the context of our meeting our targets when you look at the overall performance of the ﬁrm.",3,2022
2,2,Ebrahim Poonawala,question,question," that's helpful. and i guess just one follow-up in terms of -- you talked about organic growth opportunities in private lending given market dislocations. there are a lot of asset values that have been hit, too. just remind us in terms of m&a, where you're focused on and just appetite to execute m&a.",3,2022
3,2,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, at the moment, we continue to be extremely focused on our businesses and the growth and the things that we have on our plate in front of us. as you know , we made a couple of acquisitions. w e're in the process of integrating those acquisitions in. and at the moment, that's where our focus lies. as we go forward in the future, if there are opportunities to accelerate the growth, particularly in asset and w ealth management, we'll consider them. but at the moment, we remain very focused on integrating these acquisitions and executing on the things that we have in front of us.",3,2022
0,3,Christian Bolu,question,question," just trying to better understand the point of the reorganization of the businesses. what does this reorg mean practically for the businesses? what can they do today that they couldn't be before the reorg? i guess kind of when i listen to you, other than scaling back on consumer acquisition, i'm struggling to understand what the broader point of the reorg really is?",3,2022
1,3,David Solomon,answer,answer," christian, we've been -- it's interesting because i know you follow us closely , and we've been talking about a variety of things in this. if you go back to our investor update at the beginning of the year , we highlighted a lot of the synergies between banking and markets and how we were working to get those client activities more closely aligned. w e also highlighted in our update at the beginning of the year the synergies between asset and w ealth. and then when john spoke at the bernstein conference in may , we put a big, big spotlight on the synergies we thought bringing asset management and w ealth management closer together . so it's not that by doing this that we're doing something dramatically dif ferent. w e've been driving the ﬁrm in this direction with respect to client service and one gs for a number of years. and we think as we've done that and we've looked at that and we've learned, we think by organizing the ﬁrm this way , it makes it easier for investors to understand and see how we look at our client set and how we're operating against that client set. and so we view it as a natural progression that strengthens our ability to deliver for clients. and so that's why we've moved in this direction. that's with the big businesses, banking and markets and asset and w ealth management. on platform solutions, we have a bunch of these platforms where we're making investments. w e think they're very interesting. they're growing. they require more focus. this alignment of them allows us to shine a brighter , more transparent light on them. and we're very committed to driving them to proﬁtability and a meaningful contribution over time. and we think by organizing this way , it allows us to maintain that focus on what is a small piece of the business, but one that i think in the future allows us a dif ferentiated opportunity to serve our corporate and institutional clients.",3,2022
2,3,Christian Bolu,question,question," got you. okay . maybe switching on to consumer . i mean just looking back over time, what lessons have you guys learned in terms of trying to execute in this business? if i think about the thesis that goldman outlined as far back as 2016 in terms of building a full-scale digital bank, that was a great thesis, right? it's actually played out. you've seen a bunch of smaller new banks like square and chime really do a good job of building that. one could argue that there's been some execution challenges for goldman on consumer . you've had multiple leadership changes. now it feels like we're sort of breaking up some of the businesses and putting them in different parts of the organization. so just stepping back a little bit here, kind of what lessons have you learned in terms of execute on consumer? and what is that -- how do you take that going forward to build that business?",3,2022
3,3,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, i think, christian, what -- the steps that we've taken today are reﬂective of the learnings. and whenever you innovate and you build new platforms and new things, you're always going to be constantly looking and examining what you're doing and saying what have we learned, how can we do this better? i'd say i'm very proud of the team in our consumer business, the markets team broadly . when i look at the deposit platform that's been built and the growth from zero to over $1 10 billion of deposits over the last six years, we have 15 million customers on the platform. i think we have a very unique credit card technology that's dif ferentiated. w e have a couple of extraordinary partnerships. i think that when you look at all of that together , we have some very good things, but one of the things i think we've learned is that the ability to scale that and attract customers and the direct-to-consumer business needs to be focused in a more directed way . and so we're focusing it by aligning it with our wealth business where we have access to millions of people. and so i still see a terriﬁc opportunity to take what a really , really interesting digital products and in being aligned with our w ealth business, provide those products and services to clients and customers at goldman sachs. in addition, i think the partnerships that we've built also provide good opportunities for us to serve corporate clients with very , very interesting digital capabilities and allow them to ultimately serve their end customers or clients. and so yes, there have been bumps. not everything has been perfect. i think that always happens when you're innovating. but i also think we've built meaningful things that create meaningful opportunities for the ﬁrm as we go forward. and in particular , our ability to have a more diversiﬁed funding base and a big deposit platform that we can grow from here and an ability to of fer w ealth customers on our platform a broad array of services, i think, positions us well as we move forward.",3,2022
0,4,Betsy Graseck,question,question," so two questions. first, a follow-up on the conversation just now . is there anything that you're going to be fading as a result of this? is there any part of the consumer business that you're not going to do anymore? and i know you did the renegotiation with apple card. i guess it's through 2029, if i got it right. and how is that restructured in a way to enhance your ability to generate revenues from that? because i know you mentioned on cnbc this morning, david, that the balances aren't being carried as much as had been expected.",3,2022
1,4,David Solomon,answer,answer," so there's no -- the ﬁrst part of your question, betsy , there's no aspect of the services that we're of fering to consumers that we don't continue to of fer. the big thing, though, is this alignment that we are aligned with our w ealth business, and that gives us an audience of millions of people that we can focus on with lower customer acquisition costs and their lower forward spend as we grow or add those services to people. with respect to the apple card, i made a statement this morning that we extended and amended the partnership with apple. i just highlighted that it's very unusual for two partners to change one of these partnerships in the middle of a partnership like this. but i think it goes to the fact that it's a very , very strong partnership where there's a lot of opportunity , but because we were doing something innovative with the technology and embedding the technology and apple's platform, there were dif ferent results than we had expected. i mean one of the positive results was very , very good for consumers, if consumers have an ability and, therefore, are more actively paying down their credit card balances more quickly . that led to dif ferent modeled results in terms of what kind of balances you'd have with a certain population on the platform. and so in looking at the forward arrangement, the platform has to work for both us and apple. apple believe that. w e believe that. and so we made changes to make sure that this is attractive for both of us as we move forward and continue to try to deliver really valuable digital ﬁnancial wellness and access to consumers that are on the platform.",3,2022
2,4,Betsy Graseck,question,question," and then just on a separate topic, but the question is on the gsib surcharge. and i think over the past couple of quarters, you've highlighted how you've been looking to take action to bring your gsib score down such that you don't trip into that next 50 bp bucket in jan '24. could you give us a sense as to the progress there this quarter and if that goal is still on the table for year-end?",3,2022
3,4,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," betsy , it's denis. thanks for that question. our position is, we remain focused on targeting the 3% gsib, same message we gave at the end of the second quarter . we're one quarter closer to the end of the year . we are on track to achieve the 3% gsib level. as we indicated in the second quarter , i would reiterate now that should the opportunity set with clients or the market generally change, we could pivot away from that. but from where we sit right now today , looking into year-end, we remain focused on the 3% gsib.",3,2022
0,5,Michael Mayo,question,question," i have two easy questions that i'll requeue for , but i'll ask my harder questions now , if i'm able to requeue. on slide 5, you say that consumer revenues were $2.2 billion for the last 12 months. what were the earnings for the consumer? and the reason i ask that is there's all sorts of news articles, and i'm not sure if it's a lot of money . and i just don't know if that's the case or not or to what degree, and that makes sense in any start-up that you'd be investing along the j curve and you lose money at ﬁrst and you make money down the road. so how is consumer from a ﬁnancial standpoint, from an earnings standpoint panning out in relation to your original expectations?",3,2022
1,5,David Solomon,answer,answer," so mike, we're not giving complete transparency on the four-wall look at the consumer business. it doesn't make money at the moment. i'm not going to go further than that. but what i will say , the deposits are hugely valuable. and we do believe as the platform scales and you stop the pace of growth that we've had, so you're not front-loading reserves the same way , that what we're doing will deliver accretive returns to the ﬁrm. and so we continue to feel very , very conﬁdent with that. not everything that's reported is accurate and reﬂects the journey of innovating and building something like this, but we continue to feel very good about what we've built. we're making some shifts that we think play to our strength and strengthen our ability to accelerate the pace of these tools, this activity contributing to the ﬁrm. i'd highlight that the overall performance and the ﬁrm -- the ﬁrm's overall performance and our targets remain the same. and so again, i know this gets a lot of attention. i understand why it gets a lot of attention, and that's all okay . but we've set targets. w e're going to deliver on those targets, and we're going to make investments in things that we think strengthen the ﬁrm, and this is one of them.",3,2022
2,5,Michael Mayo,question,question," all right. i guess the reason i asked the question -- i mean, look, for the last ﬁve, 10, 20, 150 years, right, your strength has been serving your corporate relationships, investment banking. and look, that's your legacy , too, the strength there. and so when i'm looking at this third division, platform solutions, the ﬁrst two divisions are based on how you address the clients based on distribution, one goldman sachs. whereas the third division, platform solution, seems to be based on how you manufacture solutions. so that just seems like a little disconnect. so just a little bit more color . i know you'll talk about it at your newly announced investor day , but distribution, and this is based on how you manufacture clients. i'm just trying to reconcile with the goldman sachs history and what you're doing elsewhere.",3,2022
3,5,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, i appreciate that, mike. and look, it's very generous of you to account 150 years of history , but i just highlight ﬁrm looked very dif ferent in the 1860s than it looked in the 1920s, than it looked in the 1960s. the ﬁrm continues to grow and change. i joined goldman sachs in 1999, and it was 23 years ago as a partner , it was a fraction of what goldman sachs is today . so we're a big business. w e have very big businesses. and of course, our investment banking and markets business is core to who we are. it will continue to be core to who we are. it drives our earnings and performance. it drives what we're associated with. . we've built over a number of decades a very , very powerful asset and w ealth management business, what we're bringing together today . we're the ﬁfth largest active asset manager in the world, and we think we've got a real opportunity to grow that. i understand now that people accept that as being core to goldman sachs. when we started back in the '80s, i don't think people viewed it as core. but we also have 11,000 engineers here, and we're doing some very , very interesting things as the world is changing and the world is evolving with technology . after the ﬁnancial crisis, the regulatory structure came, and we became a bank. and it was clear we needed deposits and we needed to diversify our funding. and so what platform solutions represents is a handful of smaller business opportunities relative to the scale of goldman sachs that we're investing in where we think we have a capability to serve our clients. w e've, i think, done some very interesting things in transaction banking, as we've outlined. i think this card partnership is very , very interesting in terms of what it's allowing us to do. and so we think it's an opportunity . it's still small relative to goldman sachs. it's less than 5%, but we think it's an opportunity worth investing into as we continue to broaden the scope and scale of what goldman sachs can do for our clients. and that's kind of the way we're thinking about it.",3,2022
0,6,Brennan Hawken,question,question," i've got two questions and one is on the consumer pivot, but i feel like we need a break. so let me just add the other one ﬁrst. you guys -- how should we be thinking about the efﬁciency ratio this year? the last six months have been tougher revenue- wise. and so the medium -- we've been above your medium-term target of 50 -- 60%, sorry . non-comp expense is a little sticky . you guys laid out some of the things that you're trying to do there. but do you think that -- do you fully expect that you'll be hitting your 60% ratio target this year on the efﬁciency front?",3,2022
1,6,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," brennan, i'll take that for you. thanks for the question. as david indicated earlier , we remain very committed to our ﬁrm-wide targets, and we're going to look to achieve them over the medium term. the efﬁciency ratio is one of those. w e will not necessarily hit that target each and every year . this is probably one of those years. it's not been a top quartile environment for performance. but that being said, we are pulling the levers that we can pull. you'll note that our compensation and beneﬁts on a year-to-date basis is down 21%. and we're going to make sure that we size that to account for our performance in line with our pay per performance orientation but also with respect to our targets. and ﬁnally , remaining mindful that labor markets remain tight, and our talent is important to our franchise. but you can see the movement we're making in our compensation year-to-date as a component of the overall efﬁciency ratio. and then on the non-compensation side, that remains very much a focus, and we will look to continue to make progress on non-comp with the goal of driving towards the efﬁciency target.",3,2022
2,6,David Solomon,answer,answer," but brennan, just to amplify , we're committed to our efﬁciency target. it was never meant to be a target that would be hit absolutely in every single year exactly the same way . and so this obviously has been a tougher operating environment, and it's having an impact. but we remain committed to the target and are operating the ﬁrm to deliver on that target.",3,2022
3,6,Brennan Hawken,question,question," great. and then for the next one, just to come back to the -- pivot to consumer . and apologies for hitting on it again, but i think it's important because want to understand strategically , you all laid out in early 2020, david laid out a lot of the goals and aspirations around consumer and building this consumer business. it seems like this shift is a toning down of some of those aspirations. previously , we had heard that you were looking to launch some general consumer banking to complement the deposit business. and it's -- while you said before that you're not changing the current of fering, not completely clear if you're continuing to go forward with the rollout and all of the original aspirations that you were targeting. and just to be honest, when i speak with a lot of investors on goldman sachs, very few are excited about the consumer business. so i wouldn't necessarily say that a pulling back in the aspirations would necessarily be negative. i just want to try and understand strategically what the new direction is.",3,2022
4,6,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. no, brennan, i appreciate that. there's no question that the aspiration is probably got more communicated in a way that they were broader than where we're now choosing to go. and we are making it clear that we're going back on some of that. now we have built some things. w e have a checking platform. w e have an investing platform. and if you are aligning us with wealth and you have wealth customers, wealth customers can use those things, but it's very , very dif ferent to have those capabilities and be able to use them on a broad wealth platform versus directly marketing them to independent consumers on mass. and i think one of the big learnings over the last few years is that we're better to play to our strength. and now our focus is -- i think the technology with gold is very , very good, and we can now connect it to millions of people that are on our platform, and that is a narrowing of the focus for sure. it is a purposeful shift, tried to make that clear in the script. and i think it plays the strength that we have. but we are a bank. w e need deposits. w e are a wealth platform. people around a wealth platform want an ability to leave money here. actually , if you look at other wealth platforms, they have banking capabilities attached to them. and so i think we're strengthening our ability as a broad wealth platform. and i want to amplify this workplace wealth channel where we have access to millions of people is a very , very interesting place for us to attach some of the stuf f that we've now built. so i think we've made a signiﬁcant investment. w e are narrowing our focus very clearly , but i still think there are opportunities for us. and again, i want to amplify our other businesses are performing. they drive the overall results. this is still small in the overall scheme of goldman sachs, but we think that it's additive, and that's why we're trying to focus it and drive it forward in the best way . and i appreciate the comment that shareholders haven't been excited about it. and that certainly af fects some of our decision-making.",3,2022
0,7,Devin Ryan,question,question," i want to ask a question just on investment banking. m&a  ﬁnancing markets have obviously become a little more complicated recently and seen some negative marks on recent deals. i'm just curious whether you feel like some of that friction is just transitory or whether ﬁnancing markets are really starting to maybe become more concerning and crack a bit. and then kind of interrelated, just how much that's weighing on your outlook for m&a  advisory business? and where it sounds like backlogs are still solid, but you need functioning ﬁnancing as well.",3,2022
1,7,David Solomon,answer,answer," yes. i would say , devin, at a high level, we're tightening economic conditions very , very quickly . and when you tighten economic conditions, it has an impact on these things. i think the impact lagged a little bit. i do think there's been a big reset in the capital markets for ipos, for debt ﬁnancing. people have to get their minds around the valuations, the cost of capital. i think that reset is occurring. history would tell you that capital markets generally don't stay close no matter what the environment. they don't stay closed for years at a time because people have to move forward. they have to operate their businesses. they have to raise capital. and so they adjust to the new environment. that said, the prospects for economic growth are uncertain in 2023. and so i think there are going to be headwinds. so i expect a more cautious or a bumpier capital markets and m&a  environment as we head into 2023. i think we need more clarity on the trajectory of the economy and the trajectory of inﬂation to really see all that stuf f accelerate from the levels it's operating at today .",3,2022
2,7,Devin Ryan,question,question," yes. okay . great. a quick follow-up here just on deposits. deposit rate in markets right now , i think, 2.35%. the delta versus many of your bank peers is widening. and so i'm just curious what you've seen over the last couple of months, especially as customer cash sorting has been accelerating in the industry , and then whether you can just share some expectations from here around what you expect in kind of marcus deposit gathering just as rates potentially continue to move higher from there.",3,2022
3,7,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thank you for that question. so maybe just some observations across deposit ﬂows across the ﬁrm given the changing environment. on the consumer side of the equation, continuing to perform and outperform our expectations. our focus is on continuing to attract deposits. w e are deliberately positioning ourselves within the competitive envelope. and so -- in such a fashion that we can attract deposits. w e do not intend to be the price leader , but we do intend to remain competitive. it's obviously an entirely digital of fering. w e're not burdened with a lot of other cost and infrastructure. and so we have some ﬂexibility to position our pricing in such a manner that we can attract deposits to continue to grow the ﬁrm. obviously , this is something that will change over the entirety of the cycle. but thus far , it's outperforming our own expectations. on the other hand, institutional activity through transaction banking, we're observing that, that is more competitive. there is -- there are more deposits that people are seeking to raise through those channels, being more disciplined. and so we do see more competition for raising deposits through that channel relative to the consumer channel.",3,2022
0,8,Daniel Fannon,question,question," wanted to ask about w ealth management. you had a strong quarter for inﬂows versus, i think, what we saw in the industry has a bit of a slowdown sequentially , look to be a record inﬂow quarter for alts for you. can you just talk about the momentum in that business and how to think about maybe growth from here?",3,2022
1,8,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so thank you for acknowledging that. obviously , on top of that, our overall growth in management and other fees add up 15% year-over-year; in the last quarter , had almost $2.25 billion. w e're well on our way to both our $10 billion total and $2 billion alternative fee targets. and the reality of attracting these types of ﬂows over this period in time, a lot of that has to do with work and performance and track record that has been done previously . some of these particular ﬂows have longer lead times. other , shorter lead times. but looking at both the alternative commitments that we were able to secure in the quarter , looking at the change to our alternatives u.s. on the quarter , which was very strong, and then looking at our inﬂows across the more traditional channels, we are very pleased with the activity that we saw in that regard over the course of the third quarter . and we're very focused on continuing to drive that going forward.",3,2022
2,8,Daniel Fannon,question,question," got it. and then just in the consumer business, both the consumer banking as well as the private banking lending accelerated quarter-over-quarter , and you gave a handful of reasons. but just thinking about the trajectory for those businesses even in addition of -- with the realignment, just trying to think about momentum on more of the shorter-term basis. the step-ups quarter-over-quarter were quite strong. so just some color -- a little additional color there would be helpful.",3,2022
3,8,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thank you. i mean, obviously , for the ﬁrm overall, loan growth was just about $1 billion quarter-over-quarter . but we do continue to see good opportunities, particularly across the w ealth management segment. you saw better growth in that segment. it's a high-quality lending opportunity for us. and we're leveraging an existing set of relationships in existing franchise that's very much in place. w e've obviously been recognized for our advice and solution-oriented way in serving those clients, but we are ﬁnding that increasingly , they're looking for us also to provide ﬁnancing to them. and so we're making sure that we're very focused on supporting them as holistically as possible. and we see good opportunities on the ﬂoor to continue to grow those types of ﬁnancing activities.",3,2022
0,9,Matthew O'Connor,question,question," may i keep calling for the normalization of ﬁxed income trading? and i think over last quarter , you guys tried to frame what might be a good kind of medium, longer-term level. but obviously , it continues to be. and i am wondering, has it reset higher kind of permanently due to likely higher inﬂation, higher rates? and usually , that does bring higher volatility . even if things settle down from here, are we just looking at a structurally bigger and maybe materially bigger wallet than we thought not too long ago?",3,2022
1,9,David Solomon,answer,answer," look, matt, i think it's always hard to predict. but i think if you want to go back to the period before the pandemic, i do think the level of client activity and a shifting macroeconomic environment has created a larger wallet. i think one of the things that we beneﬁted from, and we continue to try to amplify this, is we've grown our wallet share by over 300 basis points since 2019. so we're beneﬁting from the fact that the available wallet is larger and has been larger for the last couple of years. but in addition, with 300 basis points of wallet share growth, that's also improved our position. so i do think clients are active. w e have a truly global franchise. it's broad. it's deep. w e're very , very focused on our market share position with the leading clients. i can't tell you what the future will bring, but i just think that our franchise is extremely well positioned. whatever that opportunity is, our relative positioning against that opportunity to serve our clients is strong.",3,2022
2,9,Matthew O'Connor,question,question," and in terms of the share gains, how much of it -- so obviously , it sounds that is you're leaning into the business with some investments, including in ﬁnancing, but how much of it is -- maybe mix has been favorable to you and there's also been some pullback by some global peers as they've been building capital and you obviously have enough to lean into it.",3,2022
3,9,David Solomon,answer,answer," well, it's hard to pull it apart. i mean if global peers are pulling back capital and resources that they allocate, the people who are committed to it, the big u.s. players are going to beneﬁt. but i actually think the big thing that has driven our share gains is the fundamental shift in the client philosophy of the ﬁrm, the investment in the one goldman sachs ethos, i think it's had a material impact on our global markets business. and i think it's af fected our shares. i think the team in that division has executed in a very , very strong way against that. it’ s improved our client relationships, improved our positioning materially with the top 100 clients. i know you know that we set out a few years ago and said we were 40 -- we had 44 of the top 100 that we were in the top 3 with. w e're now in the top 3 with over 75. that's been a very coherent -- very focused ef fort to improve our client positioning. i think that's had the biggest impact on our market shares.",3,2022
0,10,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," david, you talked about the need for deposits. and if i recall back on your investor day, one of the advantages for growing deposits was the improvement in your funding costs from wholesale funds. with the rise in rates, has that improvement lessened at all? and second, i think you had a goal of getting to 50-50 in terms of funding half of the business with deposits and then wholesale funds. and where do you stand on that?",3,2022
1,10,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," so thank you, gerard. it's denis. so i think as indicated in some of the previous comments and outlined at that original investor day , we are very focused on diversifying the funding mix, also beneﬁting from the pricing and the stickiness of that channel. w e've developed, since that period of time, multiple deposit funding channels. the digital markets platform is one of them. transaction banking is another . in terms of that original goal of changing the mix, we have achieved that. w e continue to be very , very focused on moving that mix. you'll see on a quarter-over- quarter basis that we have improved our deposits, reduced our other unsecured funding. so we remain focused on that. it's an attractive source of funding for us. it also ﬁts within the overall strategic realignment that we've been discussing.",3,2022
2,10,Gerard Cassidy,question,question," very good. and then as a follow-up in your outlook, david, for what's going on in the capital markets business, obviously , the tightening that we're all seeing. is it a straightforward in terms of an improvement of the fed ﬁnishing with its monetary tightening and markets rebound quickly after that? or do you see other factors that have to play in aside from what's going on, of course, with ukraine and russia and the european situation?",3,2022
3,10,David Solomon,answer,answer," i don't think it's simple for sure, gerard. i think it's still pretty uncertain. i do think we have to get to a point where we better understand the trajectory of inﬂation and, therefore, understand the trajectory of economic growth going forward. the fed is executing and has sent some very , very clear goals as to where they're going to the tightening cycle in the near term, but i think there's uncertainty whether or not that will get inﬂation to a place where the policy will shift going forward. and so i think we're in an uncertain period. i think that this warrants, and we're operating the ﬁrm this way with a sense of caution as we look forward. but we'll have to watch closely . but i don't have a clear answer for you as to whether or not -- if we get to the fed's current trajectory , we'll be in a place where economic growth prospects will improve as we look ahead from 2023 into 2024. i think that's still relatively uncertain.",3,2022
0,11,Jeremy Sigee,question,question," you've covered a lot of ground, so i've just got a couple of speciﬁc follow-ups, please. the ﬁrst one goes back to the cost topic and the headcount increase in this quarter . i just wondered if that's mainly seasonal with new joiners because i think the acquisition impacts were all already in the prior quarter . so i just wondered if it is just seasonality really that's driving that headcount increase and just how you think about that relative to the cost focus that you've been talking about for a couple of quarters now.",3,2022
1,11,Denis Coleman,answer,answer," sure. thank you for that. in terms of a quarter change, a lot of that change is attributable to campus hires based on time of year . our new classes of starting professionals occurs during the third quarter . we mentioned an intention to slow hiring velocity . we have indeed followed through on that topic and references to strategic growth initiatives. that's to say that slowing down the velocity of hires does not mean that we're not still making hires in the market. w e have a lot of attractive opportunities to grow the ﬁrm. there's a lot of talent inside of goldman sachs. there's also talent outside of goldman sachs that we can add to our team to continue to strengthen our ability to deliver for clients. so we are focused on overall levels of headcount growth, looking to slow it, but also remaining nimble and strategic with respect to strategic hires.",3,2022
2,11,Jeremy Sigee,question,question," very clear . and then a separate follow-up just on the w ealth management -- workplace w ealth management, which i feel is a sort of -- it's a new thing for you to talk about in such a high-proﬁle way . do you have all the building blocks that you need to be successful and to grow that space? or are there bits that you're going to have to build to make a success of that?",3,2022
3,11,David Solomon,answer,answer," so i appreciate the question, jeremy . i mean this is actually something that we started building decades ago. it started with the acquisition of ayco. i'm going to get the date wrong, but it was in the early 2000s. i think it was approximately 18 to 20 years ago, which would -- which allowed us to basically afﬁliate with corporate partners to provide wealth management services and ﬁnancial counseling to executives that then spread into the organization more broadly than just senior executives. but that business has grown nicely , and that was the building block under which we built this. and today , i think we deal with more than half of the fortune 100 and hundreds of companies in the fortune 1000. it's through that platform and then with the addition of united capital, which was investment we obviously made a few years ago, that gave us a broader high net worth footprint that's allowed us to do more to service more of the clients in the corporations we were partnered with. and then we've added digital solutions that we've been building over the last few years that allow us to reach any member of the team. so we have certain companies that we're partnered with where we're of fering ﬁnancial wellness to hundreds of thousands of employees, which ultimately can become wealth clients or depositors or come on to our platform more broadly . so the building blocks are in place. they've been put in place over a long period of time. and over the last couple of years, we've started to execute much more directly across that. and you're right, now we're amplifying what we've invested in there and trying to highlight that and make sure that some of the other pieces that we've built are aligned with that so we can strengthen it and grow it. but we think it's a big opportunity for the ﬁrm.",3,2022
0,12,Michael Mayo,question,question," i guess the word for the quarter is resiliency , if i'm hearing you correctly . and it's really remarkable that you haven't had a big blow up that's come back to hit you or your peers so far . but how are you protecting yourself against, i guess, the likelihood -- there's going to be some third-party problem that could ricocheted back on you. i'm talking about outside of, say , the largest u.s. banks, which have reported now . and then the other thing is the resiliency of the backlog is quite amazing in the face of all this volatility in stock and debt market declines. how long does that last?",3,2022
1,12,David Solomon,answer,answer," so mike, look, appreciate the question, and it's a good question. and i just start by the fact that the ﬁrm has a very , very strong risk management culture and is always focused on risk management, risk mitigation and trying to look around corners and think about what's coming. so i've tried in a number of questions today to highlight that i think things are uncertain, that we're being cautious. i think we've taken a number of actions inside the ﬁrm as we think about our risk lens in a variety of places and we think about our r wa allocation, as we think about things that we're doing to try to operate as let's be prepared for a more difﬁcult environment. now obviously , we have exposure to that because we're a large ﬁnancial ﬁrm. so you can't 100% protect yourself from that. but there is no question that we're trying to take actions to make sure we're well positioned. i think you saw during the quarter that we grew our capital buf fer during the quarter . i think that's reﬂective of a conscious decision in this environment to ran a little bit more cautiously , a little bit more conservatively . we've been watching what's been going on in markets across the uk and when we see things like that, we reﬂect back and spend a lot of time digging in and thinking about other places where those things can be ampliﬁed. and so we're extremely focused on issues like that. and i would just say that i think the world is fragile at the moment, and it's uncertain. and we're operating through that lens. w e're big ﬁnancial institutions. so we have exposure. if there were -- if there was bigger volatility or bigger problems, we could potentially have exposure to them. but on the other hand, i think that we've got a very broad global deep franchise. and we're well capitalized, and we're very focused on this. and we're going to continue to be zealous in our risk management practices to make sure on a relative basis, whatever the world throws at us, we'll serve our clients well and operate well for ourselves and our shareholders.",3,2022
