2022_Q1," Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our ﬁrst quarter earnings conference call. Today , we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www .gs.com. Note, information on forward-looking statement and non-GAAP  measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audio cast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I'm joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , David Solomon, and our Chief Financial Ofﬁcer , Denis Coleman. Let me now pass the call to David.
 Thanks, Carey . Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us this morning. There's no question the ﬁrst quarter was extremely volatile. Russia invaded Ukraine, inﬂation rose across the globe, and we saw an accelerating trend towards de- globalization. In recent decades, we've grown used to low inﬂation, low interest rates and  the free ﬂow of people and goods across national borders. I believe we're entering a period that won't be -- that won't be the case and the consequences for ﬁnancial markets will be meaningful. Although, much remains uncertain, I'm proud that Goldman Sachs ef fectively supported its clients in this type of environment. This is a testament to the progress we've made to center our strategy around clients. At a time of great volatility it was clear , our clients needed help managing their risk, and they turn to us for our expertise in navigating this changing landscape. The recent turbulence is nothing to change our ﬁrm's client-oriented strategy . In fact, it makes it all the more imperative. W e are building a more resilient, diversiﬁed franchise that can generate solid returns even in more uncertain markets. In February , I laid out our revised medium-term return targets. I'm very proud that even with the headwinds we faced; our results this quarter meet those objectives. We are also well positioned to achieve the targets we laid out for our growth initiatives across asset management, wealth management, transaction banking and consumer . In some areas, we have accelerated our progress with the acquisitions, including GreenSky , which closed in late March; and NNIP , which closed earlier this week. I'm thrilled to be welcoming these great businesses to Goldman Sachs. For the quarter , we produced net revenues of $12.9 billion, generated earnings per share of $10.76, an ROE of 15% and an ROTE of 15.8%. As I noted, the evolving market backdrop had a signiﬁcant ef fect on client activity . This meant that some parts of our ﬁrm faced signiﬁcant headwinds, like equity capital markets, where issuance volumes were lackluster for the quarter . On the other hand, Global Markets had a strong quarter , as this environment allowed us to support clients in the risk intermediation and ﬁnancing needs. And in line with our strategy , several of our growth areas continue to reﬂect durability despite the difﬁcult environment. For example, we saw solid management and other fees across asset management, wealth management, as well as revenue growth in our consumer business. But there's no question that the most signiﬁcant event of the ﬁrst quarter was the invasion of Ukraine. As I've said before, we condemn the invasion in the strongest possible terms, and our hearts go out to the Ukrainian people. This act of aggression demands a response that Goldman Sachs is committed to doing its part. Early on, we took action to ensure the well-being of our people and to begin winding down our ﬁrm's operations in Russia. That process is ongoing. Let me also say a few words on our direct ﬁnancial exposure to Russia. Our positions were relatively limited, but we've been focused on closing them out and reducing our exposure. The overall direct ﬁnancial impact from Russia and Ukraine related instruments on our ﬁrst quarter revenues was a net loss of approximately $300 million. Our risk mitigation ef forts would not have been possible without the close collaboration of our people around the globe on both the business and the control side of our ﬁrm. Our risk management culture is a true dif ferentiator for us, and we continue to navigate - as we continue to navigate this volatile environment. More broadly , the Russian invasion has further complicated the geopolitical landscape and created an additional level of uncertainty that I expect will outlast the war itself. While it is encouraging to see a newfound unity among the W estern democracies, the trend towards deglobalization is clearly gaining momentum. The consequences of that shift are likely to be signiﬁcant and long lasting, and I believe it will take some time to fully appreciate all the second and third [order] (ph) ramiﬁcations. Beyond geopolitics, I'm keeping a close eye on several other trends. While US unemployment levels are low and wages are increasing, inﬂation is the highest it's been in decades. W e're seeing new stress on supply chain and commodity prices and US households are facing rising gas prices as well as higher prices for food and housing. W e've also seen an increased risk of stagﬂation and mixed signals on consumer conﬁdence. These cross currents will certainly create ongoing complexity in the economic outlook, but whatever the future holds, I believe Goldman Sachs is well positioned. We continue to make progress on our growth strategy and our commitments to clients a strong -- our commitment to clients is stronger than ever . I'll now turn it over to Denis to cover our ﬁnancial results for the quarter in more detail.
 Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 2 of the presentation. In the ﬁrst quarter , we generated net revenues of $12.9 billion and net earnings of $3.9 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $10.76. As David noted, ﬁrm-wide performance was strong with an ROE of 15% and an ROTE of 15.8%, notwithstanding an operating environment that was signiﬁcantly less favorable than the prior year . Turning to performance by segment starting on Page 3. Investment Banking generated revenues of $2.4 billion. Financial Advisory revenues were $1.1 billion, as our M&A  franchise continued its outstanding performance and client dialogue remain signiﬁcantly elevated. In the quarter , we closed over 1 15 deals for approximately $385 billion of deal volume and maintained our number one league table position with nearly $360 billion in announced transactions. This was roughly $155 billion ahead of our next closest competitor , the largest quarterly lead in our history as a public ﬁrm. In equity underwriting, net revenues were $261 million, down signiﬁcantly versus a record performance in the ﬁrst quarter of 2021 on the lower industry issuance volumes that David mentioned. Despite this, we continue to rank number one year- to-date in equity and equity-related of ferings with volume market share of 8%. Debt underwriting net revenues were $743 million, 16% lower versus the prior year , driven by lower results in leveraged ﬁnance and asset-backed activity . While transactions have slowed from the elevated pace of last year and deals have been pushed out, given the uncertain backdrop, our investment banking backlog remains robust. Client engagement is strong, catalyzed by secular trends like digital disruption and transformation across industries and future activity will likely be bolstered by high levels of investable capital from ﬁnancial sponsors. Moving to Global Markets on page four . Segment net revenues were $7.9 billion in the quarter , up 4% year-on-year . We saw exceptional strength in both our FICC and Equities businesses. On page ﬁve, you can see revenues across FICC were $4.7 billion in the ﬁrst quarter , 21% higher than the strong results in the ﬁrst quarter of 2021. FICC intermediation produced net revenues of $4 billion. This was driven by particular strength in our macro products with elevated activity across rates, currencies, and commodities. These macro businesses within FICC, which generally represent the preponderance of FICC intermediation revenues, beneﬁt from a portfolio ef fect. Our diversiﬁed and global footprint, combined with our risk intermediation and execution capabilities is a key dif ferentiator . FICC ﬁnancing generated record revenues of $685 million, which were up 23% sequentially and 55% year-on-year with particular strength in mortgages. Total equities revenues were $3.1 billion. Equities intermediation revenues fell 16% year-over-year , driven by lower activity in both cash and derivatives due to fewer market-making opportunities compared to a very strong backdrop at the start of 2021. Equity ﬁnancing produced net revenues of $988 million. Though lower on a year-on- year basis, these results were 21% higher sequentially . While average prime balances declined slightly from record levels at year-end, opportunities to provide client liquidity increased, which drove stronger quarterly performance. Moving to Asset Management on page six, ﬁrst quarter revenues were $546 million, materially lower than the ﬁrst quarter of last year due to market headwinds in equity investments and lending and debt investments. Management and other fees totaled $772 million, up 4% sequentially . Net revenues for equity investments were negative $360 our public and private portfolios, we experienced substantial losses tied to Russia-related positions, all of which have been written down to 0. More broadly , we experienced additional headwinds due to the overall market environment. All in, we experienced roughly $620 million of net losses in our public portfolio, of fset by approximately $255 million in net gains across our private portfolio, largely due to event-driven items, including asset sales and ﬁnancing rounds. We harvested $1 billion of on-balance sheet equity investments in the ﬁrst quarter . We remain fully committed to reducing this portfolio over time and have line of sight on another $1 billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to approximately $750 million of capital reduction. Turning to page nine, Consumer & W ealth Management produced revenues of $2.1 billion in the ﬁrst quarter , up 7% sequentially and 21% year-over-year . In W ealth Management, quarterly management and other fees were $1.3 billion, down 2% versus the fourth quarter of 2021 on seasonality and counseling fees, but up 17% year-over-year . Private Banking and lending net revenues of $339 million were up 28% year-on-year , driven by higher lending and deposit balances. Consumer Banking revenues were $483 million in the ﬁrst quarter , up 28% sequentially and 30% year-over-year . We continue to grow credit card loans and deposit balances. Next, on page 10. Across these two segments, total ﬁrm-wide AUS ended the quarter at $2.4 trillion, with a quarterly decline, primarily driven by net market depreciation of $94 billion, partially of fset by $24 billion of long-term net inﬂows. Combined ﬁrm-wide management and other fees for the ﬁrst quarter rose 15% year- over-year to $2 billion, driven by higher average AUS versus last year . On page 1 1, we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments. Total ﬁrm-wide NII was $1.8 billion for the ﬁrst quarter , higher versus a year ago, reﬂecting higher loan balances and lower funding costs. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $166 billion, up $8 billion versus year-end 2021, primarily due to growth in commercial real estate and credit cards. For the ﬁrst quarter , our provision for credit losses was $561 million, up from $344 million in the fourth quarter . Provisions in the quarter were primarily due to the growth in our lending portfolio as well as broader macroeconomic factors, including a slowing growth outlook. As we continue to expand our consumer business and grow our lending activities, we are cognizant that macro headwinds and inﬂationary pressures could potentially weigh on payment rates and thus portfolio performance. While we have not seen any meaningful signs of deterioration in credit metrics, we are being vigilant and will continue to monitor performance and macro conditions to assess risk mitigation measures and calibrate our underwriting where needed. Turning to expenses on page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.7 billion, down 18% year-over-year . This drove an efﬁciency ratio for the quarter of 59.7%. Our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was 33%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $3.6 billion, 7% higher year-over-year , driven by our continued investments, particularly in technology , that will further enhance our infrastructure and support our strategic growth initiatives. Turning to capital on slide 13. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.4% at the end of the ﬁrst quarter under the standardized approach. In the quarter , we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $500 million and common stock dividends of roughly $700 million. As it relates to the second quarter , we deployed capital to support the closing of the NNIP  transaction, and we will remain nimble in response to both ongoing opportunities to support clients and the current operating environment. In conclusion, our strong ﬁrst quarter results reﬂect the durability and resilience of our client franchise across almost any environment. Despite the macroeconomic uncertainty and geopolitical complexity , we remain focused on executing on our strategic plan to diversify our business mix and drive competitive returns for shareholders, and we have signiﬁcant conﬁdence in our forward momentum as an organization. With that, we'll now open the line for questions.","For the quarter , we produced net revenues of $12.9 billion, generated earnings per share of $10.76, an ROE of 15% and an ROTE of 15.8%.

2022_Q2," Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today , we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www .gs.com. Note, information on forward-looking statements and non- GAAP  measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Ofﬁcer , Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David.
 Thanks, Carey and good morning everybody . Thank you all for joining us. I am pleased with our performance this quarter . There is no question that the market environment has gotten more complicated and a combination of macroeconomic conditions and geopolitics is having a material impact on asset  prices, market activity and conﬁdence. W e see inﬂation deeply entrenched in the economy . And what’ s unusual about this particular period is that both demand and supply are being affected by exogenous events, namely the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. In my dialogue with CEOs operating big global businesses, they tell me that they continue to see persistent inﬂation in their supply chains. Our economist, meanwhile, say there are signs that inﬂation will move lower in the second half of the year . The answer is uncertain and we will all be watching it very closely . Given all of this, we are seeing shifts in monetary policy and those shifts will continue to tighten economic conditions. I expect there is going to be more volatility and there is going to be more uncertainty . And in light of the current environment, we will manage all our resources cautiously and dynamically . Our risk management culture and capabilities should help us navigate this environment for our clients and for the ﬁrm. That said, there is nothing about this environment that changes our strategy and we are committed to our medium-term targets. W e have a strong client franchise and we remain focused on providing dif ferentiated service. W e beneﬁt from the diversity of our businesses and their global footprint. In light of the environment, we are certainly taking deliberate action on capital and expenses, but we will also continue to invest to strengthen and grow our ﬁrm. Let me now turn to our ﬁnancial results. In the second quarter , we produced net revenues of $1 1.9 billion and generated earnings per share of $7.73 and an ROE of 10.6% and an ROTE of 1 1.4%. Our book value per share ﬁnished the quarter at $302, up 14% year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter . In Investment Banking, we remain the number one adviser in M&A  and equity capital markets. And though capital markets activity has declined, our client dialogue and engagement continues to be strong. This quarter again reafﬁrmed our strategy to be global, broad and deep in our leading global markets franchise. Each week, clients turn to us for our market expertise and execution in a dynamic and uncertain environment. Our strong performance this quarter demonstrates the diversiﬁcation of our businesses across this segment. I am very proud of the fact that we have consistently executed on our strategy to improve our market share as we help our clients manage risk and meet their ﬁnancing needs. In this environment, our on-balance sheet investments faced signiﬁcant headwinds after achieving record high net revenues in 2021. Our management and other fees were resilient as we remain focused on growing fee-based revenue streams across our asset management and wealth management segments and further reducing our on-balance sheet investments as markets allow . And in consumer , we are prudently expanding our platform to serve individuals digitally , both organically and through partnerships. Before turning it over to Denis, let me spend a minute on capital, particularly in light of the recent Federal Reserve stress test results. I was glad to see the improvement in our stress capital buf fer, especially because the test this year was more challenging than in the past. This is a reﬂection of the progress we are making in our strategic evolution. That said we will advance our ef forts to improve the capital density of our businesses in order to reduce our capital requirements over time. Following the stress test results, our Board of Directors also declared a 25% increase in our quarterly dividend to $2.50 per share. This follows an increase of 60% in 2021 and over 50% in 2019. In addition, with regard to our GSIB buf fer, while we made a conscious decision to grow our balance sheet to support client activity over the last 3 years, it is our current plan to target a 3% GSIB surcharge. This intention is driven by the recent operating environment as well as client needs. Should these change, we will naturally reevaluate. In closing, I remain conﬁdent in our ability to navigate the market environment, serve our clients and create long-term value for shareholders. Despite the uncertainty we face, we continue to drive this organization forward by executing our client-oriented strategy and delivering accretive returns consistent with our targets over time. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover our ﬁnancial results for the quarter in more detail.
 Thank you, David. Good morning. Let’ s start with our results on Page 2 of the presentation. In the second quarter , we generated net revenues of $1 1.9 billion and net earnings of $2.9 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $7.73. W e reposted a return on common equity of 10.6% and return on tangible equity of 1 1.4%. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Investment Banking generated revenues of $2.1 billion, down 41% versus a year ago. Financial Advisory revenues were $1.2 billion. Our global M&A  franchise remained strong as we closed over 1 15 deals for approximately $380 billion of deal volume in the quarter , further strengthening our number one league table position. Equity underwriting net revenues were $131 million. Industry volumes remain muted given the ongoing market volatility . Despite this, we remain ready to deliver for our clients once the market backdrop for equity issuance improves. Debt underwriting net revenues were $457 million, where we saw lower levels of market activity amid sharp rate increases in the quarter . While our Investment Banking backlog is down from the peak levels last year , it is still higher than it has been at any point in our history prior to 2021. W e feel good about the quality of our backlog based on our healthy levels of strategic dialogue that span from technology and innovation to defensive repositioning of client portfolios, but we may see some softening if the challenging market environment persists. Revenues from corporate lending were $352 million, up 121% versus a year ago driven by hedge gains associated with our relationship lending book that more than offset approximately $225 million in marks on certain commitments from our acquisition ﬁnancing activities. W e saw continued growth in our Transaction Banking business. The platform now serves nearly 400 clients and has roughly $65 billion in deposits at the end of the second quarter , generating approximately $175 million in revenues year-to-date. Moving to Global Markets on Page 4, segment net revenues were $6.5 billion in the quarter , up 32% year-on-year . Growth in the quarter was driven by signiﬁcantly higher client activity as we facilitated risk intermediation for clients amid a volatile market. Looking at FICC on Page 5, revenues were $3.6 billion in the second quarter . In FICC intermediation, we saw a 50% increase in revenues with 3 of our 5 FICC intermediation businesses posting higher net revenues versus the prior year , reﬂecting the strength and breadth of our diversiﬁed franchise. Our macro franchise remained incredibly active as we help clients navigate rising rates, tightening monetary policies and continued volatility across commodities. This drove strong growth in net revenues in rates, commodities and currencies. And while revenues were lower year-on-year in credit and mortgages, clients remain engaged. Meanwhile, in FICC ﬁnancing, we saw considerable strength in mortgage lending and repo activity , which helped delivered record results. Moving to equities, net revenues in the second quarter were a solid $2.9 billion. Equities intermediation revenues fell 2% year-over-year due to a more challenging market-making environment. Activity was also impacted by lower levels of primary issuance volumes. Equities ﬁnancing revenues of $1.1 billion rose 38% versus a year ago and 14% versus the ﬁrst quarter . Increased volatility across global equity markets drove higher demand for various forms of ﬁnancing from our clients. Growth in equities ﬁnancing, coupled with record performance in FICC ﬁnancing, is a reﬂection of our strategy to grow client ﬁnancing activities, which represented nearly 30% of our overall Global Markets revenues this quarter . Moving to Asset Management on Page 6. Asset Management net revenues of $1.1 billion were materially lower than the second quarter of last year . Growth in management and incentive fees was more than of fset by net losses from our on- balance sheet investment portfolio. Management and other fees totaled $1 billion, up 39% year-over-year . This increase was driven by the roll-of f of fee waivers on money market funds and the addition of $305 billion of incremental AUS from the recently completed acquisition of NNIP , which contributed roughly $170 million of management and other fees this quarter . Equity investments generated losses of $221 million, driven by sharp market declines during the quarter . More speciﬁcally , on our public equity portfolio, we experienced roughly $660 million of net losses, reducing the value of the portfolio to approximately $2.8 billion at quarter end. In our private portfolio, we produced approximately $440 million of net revenues. W e generated event-driven gains of over $380 million from various positions across the portfolio. Additionally , we had operating revenues of approximately $165 million related to our consolidated investment entities. These revenues were partially of fset by approximately $100 million of marks, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors. We remain focused on our strategy of migrating our alternatives business to more third-party funds. And in the second quarter , we raised over $20 billion of commitments. W e also harvested over $1 billion of on-balance sheet equity investments. The pace of our realizations this quarter was inﬂuenced by both macro and micro drivers with persistent volatility in equity markets, making it more difﬁcult to harvest assets. Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in asset management were $137 million, down 78% versus a year ago as net interest income of $275 million was partly of fset by mark-to-market losses of approximately $140 million due to spread widening. I will turn to Consumer & W ealth Management on Page 9. W e produced record net revenues of $2.2 billion in the second quarter , up 25% versus a year ago, driven by higher net revenues in both W ealth Management and Consumer Banking. For the quarter , wealth management and other fees of $1.2 billion rose 10% versus last year , driven by higher placement fees and higher average assets under supervision. While private banking and lending net revenues of $320 million were down relative to record results last quarter , revenues were up 23% year-on-year due to higher lending and deposit balances. Consumer banking revenues were $608 million in the second quarter , rising 67% versus last year and 26% versus the ﬁrst quarter . Now moving to Page 10. Total ﬁrm-wide AUS ended the quarter at $2.5 trillion. Combined ﬁrm-wide management and other fees in the second quarter rose 22% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. W e expect our fee revenues to continue to grow as we progress towards our fundraising and management fee targets we laid out earlier this year. On Page 1 1, total ﬁrm-wide net interest income of $1.7 billion in the second quarter was down modestly relative to the ﬁrst quarter due to lower net interest income in Global Markets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $176 billion, up $10 billion versus the ﬁrst quarter primarily due to growth in corporate, wealth management and residential real estate loans. Our provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $667 million, up from $561 million in the ﬁrst quarter . Provisions in the quarter were primarily due to growth in our consumer lending portfolio and higher modeled losses due to economic indicators worsening quarter-over-quarter . Overall, our portfolio fundamentals remain strong as reﬂected by minimal impairments across our wholesale lending book. On the consumer side, while we do not see signs of meaningful credit deterioration, we are closely monitoring the portfolio and are taking mitigating actions as appropriate. Now, let’s turn to expenses on Page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.7 billion, down 1 1% year-over-year . Our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was 33%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4 billion. Year- over-year increases were driven by integration and run-rate expenses related to the NNIP  and GreenSky acquisitions as well as continued investments, particularly in technology , and higher levels of business activity . Together , NNIP  and GreenSky contributed approximately $200 million to non-compensation expenses this quarter . Given the challenging operating environment, we are closely reexamining all of our forward spending and investment plans to ensure the best use of our resources. As a result, we are taking a number of actions to improve our operating efﬁciency . Speciﬁcally , we have made the decision to slow hiring velocity and reduce certain professional fees going forward, though these actions will take some time to be reﬂected in our results. W e are keeping in mind, however , that while we are being disciplined about our expenses, we are not doing so to the detriment of our client franchise or our growth strategy . Turning to capital on Slide 13, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.2% at the end of the second quarter under the standardized approach, down 20 basis points sequentially and representing an 80 basis point buf fer to our current capital requirement as we enter the second half of the year . This past quarter , we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $500 million and common stock dividends of over $700 million. As David noted earlier , in the third quarter , our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 25% to $2.50 per share. Looking ahead, we will remain nimble in response to both ongoing opportunities to support clients and the current operating environment. While we will continue to deploy capital in our business where returns are accretive, we are actively evaluating share repurchases in light of our current stock price. In conclusion, our solid second quarter results reﬂect our ability to navigate volatile markets, while actively supporting our clients. W e remain conﬁdent in our ﬁnancial position, capital base and liquidity , which will help us serve clients as they navigate these challenging markets. And we are committed to executing on our growth strategy and delivering for our shareholders. With that, we will now open up the line for questions.","In the second quarter , we produced net revenues of $1 1.9 billion and generated earnings per share of $7.73 and an ROE of 10.6% and an ROTE of 1 1.4%.

Revenues from corporate lending were $352 million, up 121% versus a year ago driven by hedge gains associated with our relationship lending book that more than offset approximately $225 million in marks on certain commitments from our acquisition ﬁnancing activities. W e saw continued growth in our Transaction Banking business. The platform now serves nearly 400 clients and has roughly $65 billion in deposits at the end of the second quarter , generating approximately $175 million in revenues year-to-date. Moving to Global Markets on Page 4, segment net revenues were $6.5 billion in the quarter , up 32% year-on-year . Growth in the quarter was driven by signiﬁcantly higher client activity as we facilitated risk intermediation for clients amid a volatile market. Looking at FICC on Page 5, revenues were $3.6 billion in the second quarter . In FICC intermediation, we saw a 50% increase in revenues with 3 of our 5 FICC intermediation businesses posting higher net revenues versus the prior year , reﬂecting the strength and breadth of our diversiﬁed franchise. Our macro franchise remained incredibly active as we help clients navigate rising rates, tightening monetary policies and continued volatility across commodities. This drove strong growth in net revenues in rates, commodities and currencies. And while revenues were lower year-on-year in credit and mortgages, clients remain engaged. Meanwhile, in FICC ﬁnancing, we saw considerable strength in mortgage lending and repo activity , which helped delivered record results. Moving to equities, net revenues in the second quarter were a solid $2.9 billion. Equities intermediation revenues fell 2% year-over-year due to a more challenging market-making environment. Activity was also impacted by lower levels of primary issuance volumes. Equities ﬁnancing revenues of $1.1 billion rose 38% versus a year ago and 14% versus the ﬁrst quarter . Increased volatility across global equity markets drove higher demand for various forms of ﬁnancing from our clients. Growth in equities ﬁnancing, coupled with record performance in FICC ﬁnancing, is a reﬂection of our strategy to grow client ﬁnancing activities, which represented nearly 30% of our overall Global Markets revenues this quarter . Moving to Asset Management on Page 6. Asset Management net revenues of $1.1 billion were materially lower than the second quarter of last year . Growth in management and incentive fees was more than of fset by net losses from our on- balance sheet investment portfolio. Management and other fees totaled $1 billion, up 39% year-over-year . This increase was driven by the roll-of f of fee waivers on money market funds and the addition of $305 billion of incremental AUS from the recently completed acquisition of NNIP , which contributed roughly $170 million of management and other fees this quarter . Equity investments generated losses of $221 million, driven by sharp market declines during the quarter . More speciﬁcally , on our public equity portfolio, we experienced roughly $660 million of net losses, reducing the value of the portfolio to approximately $2.8 billion at quarter end. In our private portfolio, we produced approximately $440 million of net revenues. W e generated event-driven gains of over $380 million from various positions across the portfolio. Additionally , we had operating revenues of approximately $165 million related to our consolidated investment entities. These revenues were partially of fset by approximately $100 million of marks, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors. We remain focused on our strategy of migrating our alternatives business to more third-party funds. And in the second quarter , we raised over $20 billion of commitments. W e also harvested over $1 billion of on-balance sheet equity investments. The pace of our realizations this quarter was inﬂuenced by both macro and micro drivers with persistent volatility in equity markets, making it more difﬁcult to harvest assets. Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities in asset management were $137 million, down 78% versus a year ago as net interest income of $275 million was partly of fset by mark-to-market losses of approximately $140 million due to spread widening. I will turn to Consumer & W ealth Management on Page 9. W e produced record net revenues of $2.2 billion in the second quarter , up 25% versus a year ago, driven by higher net revenues in both W ealth Management and Consumer Banking. For the quarter , wealth management and other fees of $1.2 billion rose 10% versus last year , driven by higher placement fees and higher average assets under supervision. While private banking and lending net revenues of $320 million were down relative to record results last quarter , revenues were up 23% year-on-year due to higher lending and deposit balances. Consumer banking revenues were $608 million in the second quarter , rising 67% versus last year and 26% versus the ﬁrst quarter . Now moving to Page 10. Total ﬁrm-wide AUS ended the quarter at $2.5 trillion. Combined ﬁrm-wide management and other fees in the second quarter rose 22% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. W e expect our fee revenues to continue to grow as we progress towards our fundraising and management fee targets we laid out earlier this year. On Page 1 1, total ﬁrm-wide net interest income of $1.7 billion in the second quarter was down modestly relative to the ﬁrst quarter due to lower net interest income in Global Markets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $176 billion, up $10 billion versus the ﬁrst quarter primarily due to growth in corporate, wealth management and residential real estate loans. Our provision for credit losses in the second quarter was $667 million, up from $561 million in the ﬁrst quarter . Provisions in the quarter were primarily due to growth in our consumer lending portfolio and higher modeled losses due to economic indicators worsening quarter-over-quarter . Overall, our portfolio fundamentals remain strong as reﬂected by minimal impairments across our wholesale lending book. On the consumer side, while we do not see signs of meaningful credit deterioration, we are closely monitoring the portfolio and are taking mitigating actions as appropriate. Now, let’s turn to expenses on Page 12. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.7 billion, down 1 1% year-over-year . Our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was 33%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4 billion. Year- over-year increases were driven by integration and run-rate expenses related to the NNIP  and GreenSky acquisitions as well as continued investments, particularly in technology , and higher levels of business activity . Together , NNIP  and GreenSky contributed approximately $200 million to non-compensation expenses this quarter . Given the challenging operating environment, we are closely reexamining all of our forward spending and investment plans to ensure the best use of our resources. As a result, we are taking a number of actions to improve our operating efﬁciency . Speciﬁcally , we have made the decision to slow hiring velocity and reduce certain professional fees going forward, though these actions will take some time to be reﬂected in our results. W e are keeping in mind, however , that while we are being disciplined about our expenses, we are not doing so to the detriment of our client franchise or our growth strategy . Turning to capital on Slide 13, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.2% at the end of the second quarter under the standardized approach, down 20 basis points sequentially and representing an 80 basis point buf fer to our current capital requirement as we enter the second half of the year . This past quarter , we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $500 million and common stock dividends of over $700 million. As David noted earlier , in the third quarter , our Board of Directors increased our quarterly dividend by 25% to $2.50 per share. Looking ahead, we will remain nimble in response to both ongoing opportunities to support clients and the current operating environment. While we will continue to deploy capital in our business where returns are accretive, we are actively evaluating share repurchases in light of our current stock price. In conclusion, our solid second quarter results reﬂect our ability to navigate volatile markets, while actively supporting our clients. W e remain conﬁdent in our ﬁnancial position, capital base and liquidity , which will help us serve clients as they navigate these challenging markets. And we are committed to executing on our growth strategy and delivering for our shareholders. With that, we will now open up the line for questions.","David Solomon, Chairman and Chief Executive of Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. on the second quarter earnings conference call.

2022_Q3," Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Today , we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www .gs.com. Note, information on forward-looking statements and non- GAAP  measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined this morning by our Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Ofﬁcer , Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David.
 Thanks, Carey , and good morning, everybody . Thank you for joining us today . Let me start by saying a few words on the operating environment. Global economy continues to face signiﬁcant headwinds. Inﬂation remains high. Central banks are raising interest rates at a pace not seen in  decades. Meanwhile, equity markets are well of f the recent highs. Geopolitical instability and energy shocks are an ongoing concern and GDP  growth expectations are declining. Many of these trends accelerated towards the end of the quarter . For example, while our own ﬁnancial conditions index has indicated steady tightening all year , we saw a sharp increase in the index starting in mid-August. Everywhere I go, macro themes dominate. My conversations with CEOs, they tell me that they are rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more certainty before committing to longer term plans. As we head into the fourth quarter , my sense is that the outlook will remain unsettled, though economic performance will vary by region. I also expect volatility to persist as markets continue to digest these factors. Against this backdrop, I'm pleased that Goldman Sachs delivered solid results during third quarter . As I’ve said before, the breadth and strength of our global franchise is a key dif ferentiator for us and client engagement remains strong. For the quarter we generated net revenues of $12 billion, earnings per share of $8.25, return on equity of 1 1% and a return on tangible equity of 12%. Before handing it over to Denis to review the quarterly results in detail, I would like to spend a moment on our strategic evolution. Turning to Page 2 of the presentation. Four years ago, we set out to enhance our client engagement ef forts with a goal of further strengthening our world-class client franchise. Our One Goldman Sachs philosophy was born out of that endeavor , starting with a 30 client pilot, evolving to what has now become the operating ethos of the ﬁrm. One Goldman Sachs has been successful well beyond our expectations, proving that the strength and breadth of our global client relationships are key drivers of the execution of our strategy and continued outperformance. These ef forts have produced leading share gains, particularly in our core businesses, and have resulted in a 40% book value per share growth since our Investor Day in 2020. The execution of One Goldman Sachs over the last four years has ampliﬁed two foundational elements of our ﬁrm. First, the relationship and advisory mindset that underlies our Investment Banking franchise translates exceptionally well across client engagement more broadly . Second, the increasingly symbiotic nature of our businesses creates a virtuous ecosystem that results in a signiﬁcant multiplier ef fect and drives market share. Because of this, we're making a series of organizational changes in the fourth quarter to take the next step in the evolution of our strategy . Changes will further strengthen our core businesses, accelerate our ability to scale the growth platforms and improve efﬁciency . As you can see on Page 3, we are integrating our Asset and W ealth Management businesses, as well as our Investment Banking and Global Markets businesses into two important segments of the ﬁrm. W e will also create a new segment called Platform Solutions that will consolidate our ﬁntech platforms from across the ﬁrm, including Transaction Banking, Consumer Partnerships, and GreenSky . This segment will enhance our focus on building platforms that deliver digital ﬁnancial services capabilities to corporate and institutional clients. We will further integrate our direct-to-consumer activities into W ealth Management given the growing convergence of W ealth and Consumer banking. W e will report our full year 2022 earnings using these three segments and will also host an Investor Day on February 28, 2023. W e look forward to reviewing the details of our forward strategy across the businesses, although we will tell you now that our fundamental strategy remains the same and we will be maintaining our principal ﬁnancial targets. We are excited about the role that Asset and W ealth Management will play in our forward growth plans. Across Asset and W ealth Management, we are operating a fully scaled and integrated franchise providing advice, solutions and execution for institutions and individuals across both public and private markets. Running these businesses together will allow us to holistically drive towards our $10 billion and $2 billion management fee targets. Our investment selection and performance for our clients has supported strong momentum, particularly in alternatives and W ealth Management. We also believe that reaching and serving employees in their workplace is a signiﬁcant growth opportunity for Goldman Sachs. Through our strengthening capabilities in W orkplace and Personal W ealth, we can now address all the employees at the companies we serve. This expanded of fering is a direct response to a clear push from C-Suite leaders for more democratized suite of advice and solutions. It's also clear that these clients prefer an integrated wealth management and banking of fering, which presents us with a tremendous opportunity to connect with millions of clients through their workplace. Over the past few years, Global Markets and Investment Banking have been increasingly operating as a uniﬁed, leading, world-class franchise. W e are the advisor of choice supported by a #1 league table positions across M&A  and ECM, and we continue to bolster our leading position as a market maker and risk intermediary for our clients in markets across the globe. As the world has gotten more complex and our clients' demands have evolved, we are seeing that more and more of them are partnering with both Global Markets and Investment Banking to meet their needs. Synergies across these businesses from advice, ﬁnancing, risk distribution and hedging allows us to deliver dif ferentiated solutions to our clients. This creates a signiﬁcant multiplier ef fect and has helped us drive market share gains across the franchise in recent years. Running these businesses together will enable us to maximize our wallet share. Turning to Page 4. Platform Solutions is an end-to-end primarily cloud-based technology platform business that embeds our best-in-class ﬁnancial products and services into our clients' ecosystems to serve them and their clients and customers. In recent years, we saw opportunity to leverage our preeminent corporate franchise, world-class risk management and innovative culture to build modern digital products and in the process, diversify our revenues and funding mix. We have built and launched a Transaction Banking platform, a digital Consumer Banking platform, the largest piece of which is credit card and we acquired GreenSky . These platforms have led to partnerships with a number of our clients such as Apple, General Motors, Stripe, American Express and Fiserv . Through our relationships with Apple and General Motors, we already have the ability to access more than 100 million individuals in the U.S. Combination of our brand in Apple is unique as proven by the reaction to Apple Card, which has been ranked #1 in customer satisfaction for two consecutive years by J.D. Power . We have also extended our partnership to new products. This last week, we introduced a new Goldman Sachs savings account for Apple Card that allows users to grow their rewards in a high yield savings account and to add funds to a linked banking account or directly from Apple Cash. This embeds a high yield savings account from Goldman Sachs directly into the Apple Card experience in Apple Wallet. Goldman Sachs and Apple are committed to expanding our relationship, and we have recently extended and adjusted our partnership through the end of the decade in order to continue to help consumers with healthier ﬁnancial lives. In Transaction Banking, we are delivering a dif ferentiated developer-centric cloud- based product that allows for seamless integration into our clients' ecosystems. W e are extremely encouraged by the client feedback and adoption rate of the of fering. We now have approximately 425 active clients, with greater than $70 billion in deposits globally as we leverage our corporate franchise to become the partner of choice in the payments arena. Our priority in Platform Solutions for the next few years is to continue to diversify Goldman Sachs revenue and funding while driving proﬁtability . We will look forward to talking to you more about this segment at our Investor Day in February . Let me now address some additional details on our Consumer business. Since 2016, we've made a signiﬁcant investment. And on Page 5, you can see what we've achieved as a result. W e serve over 15 million customers and generated more than $2.2 billion in revenues in the last 12 months. W e've learned a lot in the six years since launching the deposit business, and this is shaping our execution priorities as we move forward. Turning to Page 6. For our direct-to-consumer strategy , we will focus on existing deposit customers and consumers that we already have access to through channels like W orkplace and Personal W ealth rather than seeking to acquire customers on a mass scale. The purposeful change that will allow us to rationalize spend on future builds and customer acquisition costs. In Workplace and Personal W ealth alone, we already have the ability to reach over 9 million individuals. Our Marcus deposit customers remain core to our broader ef forts. We will continue to grow the deposit of fering and the level of service that has generated over [$1 10 billion] of retail deposits. W e believe that all of our customers across all products will beneﬁt from this reprioritization. Before I turn it over to Denis to go through the results for the quarter , I want to highlight the following. Over the last four years, this leadership team has been working hard to grow , diversify and strengthen Goldman Sachs. Our experience forms this new direction so that we can better serve our clients and amplify our strengths. This is an important and purposeful evolution of our strategic journey , setting us up to deliver on our targets and unlock shareholder value. Consistent with our strategy , we are focusing on the execution -- we're focusing our execution on 3 key priorities, as you can see on Page 7, which are to grow management fees, maximize wallet share and grow ﬁnancing activities and scale Platform Solutions to deliver pretax proﬁtability . We'll talk more about this at our Investor Day in February . I will now turn it over to Denis.
 Thank you, David, and good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 8 of the presentation. As David mentioned, we generated earnings per share for the third quarter of $8.25. On a year-to-date basis, we delivered a return on common equity of 12.2% and a return on tangible equity of 13.1%. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 9. Investment Banking generated revenues of $1.6 billion, down 57% versus a very strong quarter a year ago. Financial advisory revenues were $972 million, down 41% versus record performance in the third quarter last year . Despite lower volumes, we maintained our #1 league table position year-to-date and expanded our lead. Equity underwriting net revenues were $241 million, reﬂecting limited industry-wide activity . Nonetheless, we continue to rank #1 year-to-date in equity and equity-related of ferings. Debt underwriting net revenues were $328 million, given muted issuance volumes across both high yield and investment grade. While activity remained slow this quarter , our backlog is robust, particularly in advisory and equity underwriting. Our advisory dialogues continue to be strong, though clients are focused on stability and ﬁnancial conditions, pushing out the timing of certain deal and ﬁnancing-related activity . Corporate lending generated net revenues of $35 million as solid performance in middle market lending and Transaction Banking was largely of fset by headwinds on certain hedges in our portfolio and marks in leverage lending. Moving to Global Markets on Page 10. Segment net revenues were $6.2 billion in the quarter , up 1 1% year-on-year , as client engagement and activity remains strong. Financing activities continued to demonstrate stable growth, comprising approximately 30% of the total revenues in this segment. Turning now with FICC on Page 1 1. Revenues were $3.5 billion in the third quarter , 41% higher than the third quarter of 2021. FICC intermediation produced net revenues of $2.8 billion, up 40% year-over-year . We saw strength across our rates, currencies and commodities franchises amid elevated levels of client engagement, catalyzed by increased central bank activity and volatility . In FICC ﬁnancing, we generated a 41% increase in revenues driven by increased opportunities across repo and mortgage lending. W e remain focused on growing this business in support of our clients' ﬁnancing needs. Our FICC lending portfolio is conservatively underwritten and well collateralized. Moving to Equities. Net revenues in the third quarter were $2.7 billion. Equities intermediation revenues fell 19% year-over-year due to a more challenging market- making environment and lower client activity . In Equities ﬁnancing, we generated near-record revenues of $1.1 billion as we supported client ﬁnancing activities despite lower prime balances. Moving to Asset Management on Page 12. Asset Management net revenues were $1.8 billion. Management and other fees totaled $1 billion, roughly ﬂat relative to last quarter and up 42% year-over-year , reﬂecting management fees from NNIP  and the roll-of f of fee waivers on money market funds. Equity investments generated revenues of $527 million in the third quarter . More speciﬁcally , our public equity portfolio produced approximately $215 million of revenues primarily driven by gains on two investments. Across our private portfolio, we generated approximately $310 million of net revenues. W e saw event-driven gains of over $350 million for various positions in our portfolio and operating revenues of roughly $150 million from our consolidated investment entities. These revenues were partially of fset by approximately $200 million of marks driven by several investments in the consumer and TMT sectors. Given current market conditions, our harvesting of on-balance sheet investments was limited in the third quarter , but we remain committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density and migrate our alternatives business to more third-party funds. We continue to make progress on our fundraising targets, securing $12 billion of alternative commitments this quarter . We also closed W est Street Capital Partners VIII, our ﬂagship private equity fund, which at $9.7 billion was signiﬁcantly above its original target. Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were $231 million, primarily reﬂecting net interest income of $267 million. I'll now turn to Consumer & W ealth Management on Page 14. W e produced record net revenues of $2.4 billion in the third quarter , up 18% versus a year ago, driven by signiﬁcantly higher net revenues in Consumer Banking. For the quarter , despite the market headwinds, management and other fees of $1.2 billion were relatively ﬂat sequentially as net market depreciation was largely of fset by strong client net inﬂows. Private banking and lending net revenues reached a record of $395 million, up 35% year-over-year due to higher lending and deposit balances. Consumer Banking revenues were $744 million in the third quarter , nearly double the third quarter of 2021, reﬂecting higher credit card balances and improved deposit spreads. Moving on to Page 15. Total ﬁrm-wide AUS ended the quarter at $2.4 trillion. Combined ﬁrm-wide management and other fees in the third quarter rose 15% year- over-year to $2.2 billion. On Page 16, total ﬁrm-wide net interest income of $2 billion in the third quarter was up 18% relative to the second quarter due to higher rates and increased loan balances. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $177 billion, up slightly versus the second quarter as growth in credit cards and W ealth Management loans was offset by a decrease in real estate loans. Our provision for credit losses was $515 million, primarily driven by growth in our consumer lending portfolio, net charge-of fs and worsening economic indicators, particularly in Europe. The credit quality of our wholesale lending portfolio remains resilient as reﬂected by minimal net impairments in the quarter . On the Consumer side, though we are seeing some signs of credit deterioration and an increase in charge-of fs, our credit performance remains in line with our expectations. That said, we're closely monitoring the portfolio and actively using our underwriting in light of the softening macroeconomic outlook. Let's turn to expenses on Page 17. Our total quarterly operating expenses were $7.7 billion. Our compensation ratio year-to-date net of provisions was 32.5%. Through the third quarter , our compensation and beneﬁts expenses are down over 20% relative to 2021. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.1 billion. Year-over- year increases were driven by ongoing integration and run rate expenses related to the NNIP  and GreenSky acquisitions, $191 million in litigation reserves and higher transaction-based expenses. W e remain highly focused on operating efﬁciency . As we've previously discussed, we are actively engaged in expense mitigation ef forts, and we expect that these actions will become more fully reﬂected in our results over time. Turning to capital on Slide 18. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.3% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, up 10 basis points sequentially and representing a 100 basis point buf fer to our current capital requirement. In the third quarter , we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion and common stock dividends of $893 million. As a reminder , our GSIB surcharge will increase by 50 basis points in January 2023, bringing our CET1 ratio requirement to 13.8%. W e will continue to target a buf fer of 50 basis points to 100 basis points above this requirement. In conclusion, our solid third quarter results reﬂect the diversiﬁcation and strength of our client franchise. W e are mindful of the uncertainty and volatility in the markets, and we will prudently manage our resources and maintain a risk-sensitive orientation as we continue to serve our clients. I share David's enthusiasm of the opportunities ahead of us. The further alignment of our businesses will help drive the organization forward. Successful execution of our strategic priorities, growing management fees, maximizing wallet share and scaling platform solutions will further strengthen the ﬁrm and unlock shareholder value. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.","For the quarter we generated net revenues of $12 billion, earnings per share of $8.25, return on equity of 1 1% and a return on tangible equity of 12%.

This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. Today , we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www .gs.com. Note, information on forward-looking statements and non- GAAP  measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined this morning by our Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Ofﬁcer , Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David.
 Thanks, Carey , and good morning, everybody . Thank you for joining us today . Let me start by saying a few words on the operating environment. Global economy continues to face signiﬁcant headwinds. Inﬂation remains high. Central banks are raising interest rates at a pace not seen in  decades. Meanwhile, equity markets are well of f the recent highs. Geopolitical instability and energy shocks are an ongoing concern and GDP  growth expectations are declining. Many of these trends accelerated towards the end of the quarter . For example, while our own ﬁnancial conditions index has indicated steady tightening all year , we saw a sharp increase in the index starting in mid-August. Everywhere I go, macro themes dominate. My conversations with CEOs, they tell me that they are rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more certainty before committing to longer term plans. As we head into the fourth quarter , my sense is that the outlook will remain unsettled, though economic performance will vary by region. I also expect volatility to persist as markets continue to digest these factors. Against this backdrop, I'm pleased that Goldman Sachs delivered solid results during third quarter . As I’ve said before, the breadth and strength of our global franchise is a key dif ferentiator for us and client engagement remains strong. For the quarter we generated net revenues of $12 billion, earnings per share of $8.25, return on equity of 1 1% and a return on tangible equity of 12%. Before handing it over to Denis to review the quarterly results in detail, I would like to spend a moment on our strategic evolution. Turning to Page 2 of the presentation. Four years ago, we set out to enhance our client engagement ef forts with a goal of further strengthening our world-class client franchise. Our One Goldman Sachs philosophy was born out of that endeavor , starting with a 30 client pilot, evolving to what has now become the operating ethos of the ﬁrm. One Goldman Sachs has been successful well beyond our expectations, proving that the strength and breadth of our global client relationships are key drivers of the execution of our strategy and continued outperformance. These ef forts have produced leading share gains, particularly in our core businesses, and have resulted in a 40% book value per share growth since our Investor Day in 2020. The execution of One Goldman Sachs over the last four years has ampliﬁed two foundational elements of our ﬁrm. First, the relationship and advisory mindset that underlies our Investment Banking franchise translates exceptionally well across client engagement more broadly . Second, the increasingly symbiotic nature of our businesses creates a virtuous ecosystem that results in a signiﬁcant multiplier ef fect and drives market share. Because of this, we're making a series of organizational changes in the fourth quarter to take the next step in the evolution of our strategy . Changes will further strengthen our core businesses, accelerate our ability to scale the growth platforms and improve efﬁciency . As you can see on Page 3, we are integrating our Asset and W ealth Management businesses, as well as our Investment Banking and Global Markets businesses into two important segments of the ﬁrm. W e will also create a new segment called Platform Solutions that will consolidate our ﬁntech platforms from across the ﬁrm, including Transaction Banking, Consumer Partnerships, and GreenSky . This segment will enhance our focus on building platforms that deliver digital ﬁnancial services capabilities to corporate and institutional clients. We will further integrate our direct-to-consumer activities into W ealth Management given the growing convergence of W ealth and Consumer banking. W e will report our full year 2022 earnings using these three segments and will also host an Investor Day on February 28, 2023. W e look forward to reviewing the details of our forward strategy across the businesses, although we will tell you now that our fundamental strategy remains the same and we will be maintaining our principal ﬁnancial targets. We are excited about the role that Asset and W ealth Management will play in our forward growth plans. Across Asset and W ealth Management, we are operating a fully scaled and integrated franchise providing advice, solutions and execution for institutions and individuals across both public and private markets. Running these businesses together will allow us to holistically drive towards our $10 billion and $2 billion management fee targets. Our investment selection and performance for our clients has supported strong momentum, particularly in alternatives and W ealth Management. We also believe that reaching and serving employees in their workplace is a signiﬁcant growth opportunity for Goldman Sachs. Through our strengthening capabilities in W orkplace and Personal W ealth, we can now address all the employees at the companies we serve. This expanded of fering is a direct response to a clear push from C-Suite leaders for more democratized suite of advice and solutions. It's also clear that these clients prefer an integrated wealth management and banking of fering, which presents us with a tremendous opportunity to connect with millions of clients through their workplace. Over the past few years, Global Markets and Investment Banking have been increasingly operating as a uniﬁed, leading, world-class franchise. W e are the advisor of choice supported by a #1 league table positions across M&A  and ECM, and we continue to bolster our leading position as a market maker and risk intermediary for our clients in markets across the globe. As the world has gotten more complex and our clients' demands have evolved, we are seeing that more and more of them are partnering with both Global Markets and Investment Banking to meet their needs. Synergies across these businesses from advice, ﬁnancing, risk distribution and hedging allows us to deliver dif ferentiated solutions to our clients. This creates a signiﬁcant multiplier ef fect and has helped us drive market share gains across the franchise in recent years. Running these businesses together will enable us to maximize our wallet share. Turning to Page 4. Platform Solutions is an end-to-end primarily cloud-based technology platform business that embeds our best-in-class ﬁnancial products and services into our clients' ecosystems to serve them and their clients and customers. In recent years, we saw opportunity to leverage our preeminent corporate franchise, world-class risk management and innovative culture to build modern digital products and in the process, diversify our revenues and funding mix. We have built and launched a Transaction Banking platform, a digital Consumer Banking platform, the largest piece of which is credit card and we acquired GreenSky . These platforms have led to partnerships with a number of our clients such as Apple, General Motors, Stripe, American Express and Fiserv . Through our relationships with Apple and General Motors, we already have the ability to access more than 100 million individuals in the U.S. Combination of our brand in Apple is unique as proven by the reaction to Apple Card, which has been ranked #1 in customer satisfaction for two consecutive years by J.D. Power . We have also extended our partnership to new products. This last week, we introduced a new Goldman Sachs savings account for Apple Card that allows users to grow their rewards in a high yield savings account and to add funds to a linked banking account or directly from Apple Cash. This embeds a high yield savings account from Goldman Sachs directly into the Apple Card experience in Apple Wallet. Goldman Sachs and Apple are committed to expanding our relationship, and we have recently extended and adjusted our partnership through the end of the decade in order to continue to help consumers with healthier ﬁnancial lives. In Transaction Banking, we are delivering a dif ferentiated developer-centric cloud- based product that allows for seamless integration into our clients' ecosystems. W e are extremely encouraged by the client feedback and adoption rate of the of fering. We now have approximately 425 active clients, with greater than $70 billion in deposits globally as we leverage our corporate franchise to become the partner of choice in the payments arena. Our priority in Platform Solutions for the next few years is to continue to diversify Goldman Sachs revenue and funding while driving proﬁtability . We will look forward to talking to you more about this segment at our Investor Day in February . Let me now address some additional details on our Consumer business. Since 2016, we've made a signiﬁcant investment. And on Page 5, you can see what we've achieved as a result. W e serve over 15 million customers and generated more than $2.2 billion in revenues in the last 12 months. W e've learned a lot in the six years since launching the deposit business, and this is shaping our execution priorities as we move forward. Turning to Page 6. For our direct-to-consumer strategy , we will focus on existing deposit customers and consumers that we already have access to through channels like W orkplace and Personal W ealth rather than seeking to acquire customers on a mass scale. The purposeful change that will allow us to rationalize spend on future builds and customer acquisition costs. In Workplace and Personal W ealth alone, we already have the ability to reach over 9 million individuals. Our Marcus deposit customers remain core to our broader ef forts. We will continue to grow the deposit of fering and the level of service that has generated over [$1 10 billion] of retail deposits. W e believe that all of our customers across all products will beneﬁt from this reprioritization. Before I turn it over to Denis to go through the results for the quarter , I want to highlight the following. Over the last four years, this leadership team has been working hard to grow , diversify and strengthen Goldman Sachs. Our experience forms this new direction so that we can better serve our clients and amplify our strengths. This is an important and purposeful evolution of our strategic journey , setting us up to deliver on our targets and unlock shareholder value. Consistent with our strategy , we are focusing on the execution -- we're focusing our execution on 3 key priorities, as you can see on Page 7, which are to grow management fees, maximize wallet share and grow ﬁnancing activities and scale Platform Solutions to deliver pretax proﬁtability . We'll talk more about this at our Investor Day in February . I will now turn it over to Denis.
 Thank you, David, and good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 8 of the presentation. As David mentioned, we generated earnings per share for the third quarter of $8.25. On a year-to-date basis, we delivered a return on common equity of 12.2% and a return on tangible equity of 13.1%. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 9. Investment Banking generated revenues of $1.6 billion, down 57% versus a very strong quarter a year ago. Financial advisory revenues were $972 million, down 41% versus record performance in the third quarter last year . Despite lower volumes, we maintained our #1 league table position year-to-date and expanded our lead. Equity underwriting net revenues were $241 million, reﬂecting limited industry-wide activity . Nonetheless, we continue to rank #1 year-to-date in equity and equity-related of ferings. Debt underwriting net revenues were $328 million, given muted issuance volumes across both high yield and investment grade. While activity remained slow this quarter , our backlog is robust, particularly in advisory and equity underwriting. Our advisory dialogues continue to be strong, though clients are focused on stability and ﬁnancial conditions, pushing out the timing of certain deal and ﬁnancing-related activity . Corporate lending generated net revenues of $35 million as solid performance in middle market lending and Transaction Banking was largely of fset by headwinds on certain hedges in our portfolio and marks in leverage lending. Moving to Global Markets on Page 10. Segment net revenues were $6.2 billion in the quarter , up 1 1% year-on-year , as client engagement and activity remains strong. Financing activities continued to demonstrate stable growth, comprising approximately 30% of the total revenues in this segment. Turning now with FICC on Page 1 1. Revenues were $3.5 billion in the third quarter , 41% higher than the third quarter of 2021. FICC intermediation produced net revenues of $2.8 billion, up 40% year-over-year . We saw strength across our rates, currencies and commodities franchises amid elevated levels of client engagement, catalyzed by increased central bank activity and volatility . In FICC ﬁnancing, we generated a 41% increase in revenues driven by increased opportunities across repo and mortgage lending. W e remain focused on growing this business in support of our clients' ﬁnancing needs. Our FICC lending portfolio is conservatively underwritten and well collateralized. Moving to Equities. Net revenues in the third quarter were $2.7 billion. Equities intermediation revenues fell 19% year-over-year due to a more challenging market- making environment and lower client activity . In Equities ﬁnancing, we generated near-record revenues of $1.1 billion as we supported client ﬁnancing activities despite lower prime balances. Moving to Asset Management on Page 12. Asset Management net revenues were $1.8 billion. Management and other fees totaled $1 billion, roughly ﬂat relative to last quarter and up 42% year-over-year , reﬂecting management fees from NNIP  and the roll-of f of fee waivers on money market funds. Equity investments generated revenues of $527 million in the third quarter . More speciﬁcally , our public equity portfolio produced approximately $215 million of revenues primarily driven by gains on two investments. Across our private portfolio, we generated approximately $310 million of net revenues. W e saw event-driven gains of over $350 million for various positions in our portfolio and operating revenues of roughly $150 million from our consolidated investment entities. These revenues were partially of fset by approximately $200 million of marks driven by several investments in the consumer and TMT sectors. Given current market conditions, our harvesting of on-balance sheet investments was limited in the third quarter , but we remain committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density and migrate our alternatives business to more third-party funds. We continue to make progress on our fundraising targets, securing $12 billion of alternative commitments this quarter . We also closed W est Street Capital Partners VIII, our ﬂagship private equity fund, which at $9.7 billion was signiﬁcantly above its original target. Net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were $231 million, primarily reﬂecting net interest income of $267 million. I'll now turn to Consumer & W ealth Management on Page 14. W e produced record net revenues of $2.4 billion in the third quarter , up 18% versus a year ago, driven by signiﬁcantly higher net revenues in Consumer Banking.

As we've previously discussed, we are actively engaged in expense mitigation ef forts, and we expect that these actions will become more fully reﬂected in our results over time. Turning to capital on Slide 18. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.3% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, up 10 basis points sequentially and representing a 100 basis point buf fer to our current capital requirement. In the third quarter , we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion and common stock dividends of $893 million.

2022_Q4," Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations and Chief Strategic Ofﬁcer at Goldman Sachs. W elcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Today , we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www .gs.com. Note information and forward-looking statements and non-GAAP  measures appear in the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined by our Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Ofﬁcer , Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David.
 Thanks, Carey and good morning everyone. Thank you all for joining us today . I will begin with a review of our ﬁnancial performance. Simply said, our quarter was disappointing and our business mix proved particularly challenging. These results are not what we aspire to deliver to shareholders. W e generated revenues of $10.6 billion and net earnings of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $3.32. After nine straight quarters of double-digit returns, fourth quarter performance was certainly an outlier . Results were impacted by several near-term challenges given the difﬁcult operating environment. On the revenue front, underwriting volumes remained extremely muted despite green shoots that appeared at the end of the third quarter . FICC and equity activities - activity levels dropped after a busy and volatile year for many of our clients and our equity investment portfolio saw continued headwinds. We also saw higher loan loss provision and expenses. While compensation expenses were down 15% for the year , quarterly expenses rose modestly versus the third quarter . We always strive to maintain a pay-for-performance culture. With revenues down, compensation was lower . That said we also recognize that we operate in a talent-driven business and we must continue to invest in our people whose dedication is critical to our world class franchise. On our earnings call last July , we ﬁrst spoke about the challenging operating environment and the proactive measures we were taking on expenses, including slowing hiring velocity and reducing certain components of our non-compensation costs. W e have and continue to be incredibly focused on managing our ﬁnancial resources, especially in light of the worse-than-expected backdrop in the fourth quarter . Speciﬁcally , we reduced the size of our balance sheet, further optimized and reduced our R WA footprint and managed down our G-SIB score to hit our 3% target. We have also started ﬁrm-wide expense reduction ef forts to of fset inﬂationary pressures and right-size the ﬁrm for the current environment. We made the difﬁcult decision to conduct a 6% headcount reduction exercise earlier this month. As we said, we had paused our regular performance management- related reductions during the pandemic and also had a period of strong growth in headcount given the opportunity set in 2021. W e feel deeply for the individuals that were impacted by these reductions. They are extremely dedicated and talented individuals and we wish them the best. Additionally , we are taking a number of strategic actions to help us reach our ﬁnancial targets and create shareholder value. For instance, this quarter , we completed our reorganization, which will further strengthen our core businesses, help us scale our growth platforms and improve efﬁciency . This is an important and purposeful evolution of our strategic journey . We also narrowed our ambitions on our consumer strategy and made some key decisions. W e started a process to cease offering new loans on the Marcus platform. W e will likely allow the book to roll down naturally , although we are considering other alternatives. In addition, we have postponed the launch of our checking product. At the right time in the future, we intend to of fer checking to our wealth management clients. For now , our priority is to strengthen our deposit franchise, card partnerships and GreenSky . Our narrowed approach will allow us to reduce our forward investment spend and rationalize expenses. W e are very focused on developing a path toward proﬁtability and platform solutions and we will provide more detail at our Investor Day next month. As you can see from our new segment reporting, we are committed to providing continued transparency for us – for you to hold us accountable. I want to spend a moment on the broader operating environment. The backdrop over the last year has been incredibly dynamic. There were headwinds we expected, like high inﬂation, but some we never thought we would see like the ongoing land war in Ukraine. There aren’t many signs of widespread distress, balance sheets and company fundamentals are relatively healthy , but it’ s clear that the outlook for 2023 remains uncertain. In the U.S., central bank rate increases have started to have an impact on inﬂation, but they are also lowering the growth trajectory of the economy . And the labor market remains remarkably tight with an estimated 1.7 job openings available for every unemployed American. Our clients are thinking a lot about how to navigate this complex backdrop. CEOs and Boards tell me they are cautious, particularly for the near-term. They are rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more stability before committing to longer term plans. Many ﬁrms have started preparing for tougher times focusing on factors within their control. Taking a step back, I am proud of the signiﬁcant progress we have made in our strategic evolution since Investor Day 2020. Despite a more challenged fourth quarter performance, we delivered for shareholders in 2022. W e generated double- digit returns in a year where rapid monetary tightening and ongoing macro uncertainty drove signiﬁcant market disruption with both equity and ﬁxed income markets falling for the ﬁrst time in over 50 years. We grew management and other fees by 13% year-over-year and grew net interest income by 19%. W e reduced our on-balance sheet alternative investments by $9 billion. W e also returned $6.7 billion of capital in the form of dividends and share repurchases and we grew our book value by 7%. This brings our book value growth since our ﬁrst Investor Day to almost 40%, roughly twice as much as our next closest competitor . That said, we remain focused on the work ahead of us and we believe we have a lot to play for . As we go forward, we are executing on three key priorities we have laid out for the businesses: number one, growing management fees in our asset and wealth management business; number two, maximizing wallet share and growing ﬁnancing activities and our global banking and markets business; number three, scaling platform solutions to deliver proﬁtability . We have a proven track record of navigating a wide range of operating environments and we will continue to execute our long-term client-oriented strategy regardless of where we are in the cycle. W e have the people in place around the world to serve our clients’  broad range of needs with excellence and we are operating from a position of strength with robust capital levels and a clear focus on the path forward. I remain optimistic about the future of Goldman Sachs and conﬁdent that we will continue to deliver for shareholders. W e look forward to speaking more about this with all of you at our Investor Day on February 28. I will now turn it over to Denis.
 Thank you, David. Good morning. Let’ s start on Page 2 of the presentation. In 2022, we generated net revenues of $47.4 billion, net earnings of $1 1.3 billion and earnings per share of $30.06. As David highlighted, we have implemented our organizational changes, which form the basis for our earnings presentation today . Turning to performance by business, starting on Page 3. Global Banking and Markets generated revenues of $32.5 billion for the year , down 12% as higher FICC revenues were more than of fset by a steep decline in investment banking fees versus record results last year . The exceptional performance of our Global Banking and Markets business over the last 3 years, including the market share gains we have generated has served a strong ballast for ﬁrm-wide performance. In the fourth quarter , investment banking fees fell 48% year-over-year driven by a signiﬁcant decline in both equity and debt underwriting as issuance volumes remain muted amid continued market uncertainty . Advisory revenues, however , were $1.4 billion, the third highest in our history rising 45% quarter-over-quarter on higher completed deal volumes. For 2022, we maintained our number one league table position in completed M&A  as we have for 23 of the last 24 years and we ranked second in equity and equity- related underwriting. W e also ranked second in high-yield debt underwriting, up from number three last year . Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter on lower levels of activity , but remain solid, particularly in advisory . That being said, clients are focused on stability and ﬁnancial conditions, pushing out the timing of transactional activity . While we expect investors will need more certainty before ﬁnancing markets reopen more broadly , we are seeing some positive signs of activity , particularly in investment grade markets, which have had a strong start to the year in both the United States and Europe. FICC net revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter , up 44% year-on-year . In intermediation, we saw strength in rates and commodities amid elevated levels of client engagement, catalyzed by increased central bank activity and rate volatility and improved market-making conditions. In FICC ﬁnancing, we saw increases in secured lending driven by higher balances. Full year FICC revenues of $14.7 billion rose 38%. Equities net revenues were $2.1 billion in the quarter , down 5% year-on-year . The year-over-year decline in intermediation revenues was driven by lower levels of client activity , particularly in derivatives, after strong engagement levels throughout the year . Financing revenues of $964 million were relatively resilient despite a decline in prime balances as clients took risk of f throughout the quarter . Across FICC and Equities, ﬁnancing revenues were up 20% in 2022, consistent with our strategic priority to grow client ﬁnancing activities. Moving to Asset & W ealth Management on Page 5. For 2022, revenues of $13.4 billion were down 39% year-over-year as a steep decline in revenues from equity and debt investments of fset an additional $1 billion of management and other fees and a strong increase in private banking and lending revenues. Fourth quarter management and other fees of $2.2 billion were up 10% year-over- year. Full year management and other fees were $8.8 billion putting us well on track to hit our $10 billion target in 2024. Fourth quarter private banking and lending net revenues reached a record $753 million, up 77% year-over-year due to higher deposit spreads and higher lending and deposit balances. Equity investments produced net revenues of $287 million, driven by $270 million of gains on our $13 billion private equity portfolio and roughly $500 million in operating revenues and gains related to CIEs, partially of fset by $485 million of net losses related to investments in our $2 billion public portfolio. Debt investments revenues were $234 million, including net interest income of $360 million. Moving on to Page 6. Total ﬁrm-wide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.5 trillion, driven by market appreciation as well as strong net inﬂows across ﬁxed income and liquidity products. Let’s now turn to Page 7 where I will review a new page in our presentation focused on our alternatives franchise. Alternative AUS totaled $263 billion at the end of the fourth quarter , driving $492 million in management and other fees for the quarter and $1.8 billion for the year . We remain on track to reach our $2 billion target in 2024. Gross third-party fundraising was $15 billion for the quarter and totaled $72 billion for the year . Third-party fundraising since Investor Day stands at $179 billion. The table on the bottom left shows our on-balance sheet alternative investment portfolio, which totaled $59 billion. Despite the challenging environment, we reduced on-balance sheet investments by $9 billion in 2022, of which $2 billion was in the fourth quarter . We remain committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density and migrate our alternatives business to more third-party funds. I will turn to Platform Solutions on Page 8. Full year revenues were $1.5 billion, more than double versus 2021. Full year losses of $1.7 billion were driven by $1.7 billion of provisions as we built reserves to reﬂect $8 billion of loan growth across the portfolio. We also incurred $1.8 billion in expenses as we continue to build out and run these businesses. This included over $200 million of transaction and integration-related costs driven by the GreenSky and GM card portfolio acquisitions. W e expect these costs to also impact 2023 results, though at a lower level and decline materially over subsequent years. As David said, our number one priority for this segment is to reach proﬁtability and we look forward to providing you with further details at our Investor Day next month. On Page 9, ﬁrm-wide net interest income of $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter was up 2% relative to the third quarter due to higher rates and increased loan balances. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $179 billion, modestly higher versus the third quarter , reﬂecting growth in collateralized lending and credit cards. Our provision for credit losses was $972 million. For our wholesale portfolio, provisions were driven by impairments and portfolio growth. The overall credit quality of our wholesale lending portfolio remains resilient. In relation to our retail portfolio, provisions were driven by continued portfolio growth, net charge-of fs and a worsening of our baseline scenario. We are seeing early signs of credit deterioration that are in line with our expectations. W e anticipate further pressure in 2023 given the vintage and nature of our portfolio. Let’s turn to expenses on Page 10. Quarterly operating expenses were $8.1 billion. Total operating expenses for the year were $31.2 billion, down 2%. Compensation expenses fell 15% despite a 10% increase in headcount and were partially of fset by higher non-compensation expenses. The increase was primarily related to acquisitions, transaction-based costs and continued investments in technology . In addition, client-driven market development costs were higher following lower levels during the pandemic. As previously discussed, we are actively engaged in expense mitigation ef forts. This includes targeted reductions across communications and technology spend, professional fees and advertising costs as well as the recent headcount reduction exercise. W e expect that the impact of these actions will become more fully reﬂected in our results over time, remain highly focused on operating efﬁciency and are committed to our 60% efﬁciency ratio target as the right place to run the ﬁrm. Turning to capital on Slide 1 1. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 15.1% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, up 80 basis points sequentially . This represents a 130 basis point buf fer to our new capital requirement of 13.8%. In the fourth quarter , we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $880 million. Based on our capital levels at the end of the quarter , we started 2023 with a strong capital position, enabling us to support our clients and return excess capital to shareholders. As it relates to our funding plan based on current expectations, we intend for 2023 issuance to run signiﬁcantly below 2022 levels, though we will remain dynamic with respect to business needs and market opportunities. In conclusion, despite the challenging operating environment in 2022, we delivered double-digit returns for shareholders, returned $6.7 billion of capital and made material progress on our strategic initiatives to better serve clients and strengthen and diversify the ﬁrm. W e remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities and creating value for our shareholders and we look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day in February . With that, we will now open up the line for questions.","W e generated revenues of $10.6 billion and net earnings of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $3.32.

As you can see from our new segment reporting, we are committed to providing continued transparency for us – for you to hold us accountable. I want to spend a moment on the broader operating environment. The backdrop over the last year has been incredibly dynamic. There were headwinds we expected, like high inﬂation, but some we never thought we would see like the ongoing land war in Ukraine. There aren’t many signs of widespread distress, balance sheets and company fundamentals are relatively healthy , but it’ s clear that the outlook for 2023 remains uncertain. In the U.S., central bank rate increases have started to have an impact on inﬂation, but they are also lowering the growth trajectory of the economy . And the labor market remains remarkably tight with an estimated 1.7 job openings available for every unemployed American. Our clients are thinking a lot about how to navigate this complex backdrop. CEOs and Boards tell me they are cautious, particularly for the near-term. They are rethinking business opportunities and would like to see more stability before committing to longer term plans. Many ﬁrms have started preparing for tougher times focusing on factors within their control. Taking a step back, I am proud of the signiﬁcant progress we have made in our strategic evolution since Investor Day 2020. Despite a more challenged fourth quarter performance, we delivered for shareholders in 2022. W e generated double- digit returns in a year where rapid monetary tightening and ongoing macro uncertainty drove signiﬁcant market disruption with both equity and ﬁxed income markets falling for the ﬁrst time in over 50 years. We grew management and other fees by 13% year-over-year and grew net interest income by 19%. W e reduced our on-balance sheet alternative investments by $9 billion. W e also returned $6.7 billion of capital in the form of dividends and share repurchases and we grew our book value by 7%. This brings our book value growth since our ﬁrst Investor Day to almost 40%, roughly twice as much as our next closest competitor . That said, we remain focused on the work ahead of us and we believe we have a lot to play for . As we go forward, we are executing on three key priorities we have laid out for the businesses: number one, growing management fees in our asset and wealth management business; number two, maximizing wallet share and growing ﬁnancing activities and our global banking and markets business; number three, scaling platform solutions to deliver proﬁtability . We have a proven track record of navigating a wide range of operating environments and we will continue to execute our long-term client-oriented strategy regardless of where we are in the cycle. W e have the people in place around the world to serve our clients’  broad range of needs with excellence and we are operating from a position of strength with robust capital levels and a clear focus on the path forward. I remain optimistic about the future of Goldman Sachs and conﬁdent that we will continue to deliver for shareholders. W e look forward to speaking more about this with all of you at our Investor Day on February 28. I will now turn it over to Denis.
 Thank you, David. Good morning. Let’ s start on Page 2 of the presentation. In 2022, we generated net revenues of $47.4 billion, net earnings of $1 1.3 billion and earnings per share of $30.06. As David highlighted, we have implemented our organizational changes, which form the basis for our earnings presentation today . Turning to performance by business, starting on Page 3. Global Banking and Markets generated revenues of $32.5 billion for the year , down 12% as higher FICC revenues were more than of fset by a steep decline in investment banking fees versus record results last year . The exceptional performance of our Global Banking and Markets business over the last 3 years, including the market share gains we have generated has served a strong ballast for ﬁrm-wide performance. In the fourth quarter , investment banking fees fell 48% year-over-year driven by a signiﬁcant decline in both equity and debt underwriting as issuance volumes remain muted amid continued market uncertainty . Advisory revenues, however , were $1.4 billion, the third highest in our history rising 45% quarter-over-quarter on higher completed deal volumes. For 2022, we maintained our number one league table position in completed M&A  as we have for 23 of the last 24 years and we ranked second in equity and equity- related underwriting. W e also ranked second in high-yield debt underwriting, up from number three last year . Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter on lower levels of activity , but remain solid, particularly in advisory . That being said, clients are focused on stability and ﬁnancial conditions, pushing out the timing of transactional activity . While we expect investors will need more certainty before ﬁnancing markets reopen more broadly , we are seeing some positive signs of activity , particularly in investment grade markets, which have had a strong start to the year in both the United States and Europe. FICC net revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter , up 44% year-on-year . In intermediation, we saw strength in rates and commodities amid elevated levels of client engagement, catalyzed by increased central bank activity and rate volatility and improved market-making conditions. In FICC ﬁnancing, we saw increases in secured lending driven by higher balances. Full year FICC revenues of $14.7 billion rose 38%. Equities net revenues were $2.1 billion in the quarter , down 5% year-on-year . The year-over-year decline in intermediation revenues was driven by lower levels of client activity , particularly in derivatives, after strong engagement levels throughout the year . Financing revenues of $964 million were relatively resilient despite a decline in prime balances as clients took risk of f throughout the quarter . Across FICC and Equities, ﬁnancing revenues were up 20% in 2022, consistent with our strategic priority to grow client ﬁnancing activities. Moving to Asset & W ealth Management on Page 5. For 2022, revenues of $13.4 billion were down 39% year-over-year as a steep decline in revenues from equity and debt investments of fset an additional $1 billion of management and other fees and a strong increase in private banking and lending revenues. Fourth quarter management and other fees of $2.2 billion were up 10% year-over- year. Full year management and other fees were $8.8 billion putting us well on track to hit our $10 billion target in 2024. Fourth quarter private banking and lending net revenues reached a record $753 million, up 77% year-over-year due to higher deposit spreads and higher lending and deposit balances. Equity investments produced net revenues of $287 million, driven by $270 million of gains on our $13 billion private equity portfolio and roughly $500 million in operating revenues and gains related to CIEs, partially of fset by $485 million of net losses related to investments in our $2 billion public portfolio. Debt investments revenues were $234 million, including net interest income of $360 million. Moving on to Page 6. Total ﬁrm-wide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.5 trillion, driven by market appreciation as well as strong net inﬂows across ﬁxed income and liquidity products. Let’s now turn to Page 7 where I will review a new page in our presentation focused on our alternatives franchise. Alternative AUS totaled $263 billion at the end of the fourth quarter , driving $492 million in management and other fees for the quarter and $1.8 billion for the year . We remain on track to reach our $2 billion target in 2024. Gross third-party fundraising was $15 billion for the quarter and totaled $72 billion for the year . Third-party fundraising since Investor Day stands at $179 billion. The table on the bottom left shows our on-balance sheet alternative investment portfolio, which totaled $59 billion. Despite the challenging environment, we reduced on-balance sheet investments by $9 billion in 2022, of which $2 billion was in the fourth quarter . We remain committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density and migrate our alternatives business to more third-party funds. I will turn to Platform Solutions on Page 8. Full year revenues were $1.5 billion, more than double versus 2021. Full year losses of $1.7 billion were driven by $1.7 billion of provisions as we built reserves to reﬂect $8 billion of loan growth across the portfolio. We also incurred $1.8 billion in expenses as we continue to build out and run these businesses. This included over $200 million of transaction and integration-related costs driven by the GreenSky and GM card portfolio acquisitions. W e expect these costs to also impact 2023 results, though at a lower level and decline materially over subsequent years. As David said, our number one priority for this segment is to reach proﬁtability and we look forward to providing you with further details at our Investor Day next month. On Page 9, ﬁrm-wide net interest income of $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter was up 2% relative to the third quarter due to higher rates and increased loan balances. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $179 billion, modestly higher versus the third quarter , reﬂecting growth in collateralized lending and credit cards. Our provision for credit losses was $972 million. For our wholesale portfolio, provisions were driven by impairments and portfolio growth. The overall credit quality of our wholesale lending portfolio remains resilient. In relation to our retail portfolio, provisions were driven by continued portfolio growth, net charge-of fs and a worsening of our baseline scenario. We are seeing early signs of credit deterioration that are in line with our expectations. W e anticipate further pressure in 2023 given the vintage and nature of our portfolio. Let’s turn to expenses on Page 10. Quarterly operating expenses were $8.1 billion. Total operating expenses for the year were $31.2 billion, down 2%. Compensation expenses fell 15% despite a 10% increase in headcount and were partially of fset by higher non-compensation expenses. The increase was primarily related to acquisitions, transaction-based costs and continued investments in technology . In addition, client-driven market development costs were higher following lower levels during the pandemic. As previously discussed, we are actively engaged in expense mitigation ef forts. This includes targeted reductions across communications and technology spend, professional fees and advertising costs as well as the recent headcount reduction exercise. W e expect that the impact of these actions will become more fully reﬂected in our results over time, remain highly focused on operating efﬁciency and are committed to our 60% efﬁciency ratio target as the right place to run the ﬁrm. Turning to capital on Slide 1 1. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 15.1% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, up 80 basis points sequentially . This represents a 130 basis point buf fer to our new capital requirement of 13.8%. In the fourth quarter , we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $880 million. Based on our capital levels at the end of the quarter , we started 2023 with a strong capital position, enabling us to support our clients and return excess capital to shareholders. As it relates to our funding plan based on current expectations, we intend for 2023 issuance to run signiﬁcantly below 2022 levels, though we will remain dynamic with respect to business needs and market opportunities. In conclusion, despite the challenging operating environment in 2022, we delivered double-digit returns for shareholders, returned $6.7 billion of capital and made material progress on our strategic initiatives to better serve clients and strengthen and diversify the ﬁrm. W e remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities and creating value for our shareholders and we look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming Investor Day in February . With that, we will now open up the line for questions.","Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. has released its fourth quarter earnings.

2023_Q1," Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations and Chief Strategy Ofﬁcer , Goldman Sachs. W elcome to our ﬁrst quarter earnings conference call. Today we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www .gs.com. Note information on forward- looking statements and non-GAAP  measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , David Solomon, and our Chief Financial Ofﬁcer , Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David.
 Thanks, Carey , and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. In the ﬁrst quarter , we delivered solid performance in a challenging environment. W e produced net revenues of $12.2 billion and generated earnings per share of $8.79 and an ROE of 1 1.6% and an ROTE of 12.6%. The ﬁrst quarter was certainly volatile, particularly for the banking sector . After a fairly benign operating environment at the start of the year , in March, we witnessed the collapse of two regional banks in the United States. Stress quickly spread to a number of institutions across the ﬁnancial sector where we saw ratings downgrades and steep valuation declines in very short order . These stresses were not limited to the U.S., as we saw when regulators help arrange the combination of Switzerland's two largest ﬁnancial institutions. It's important to appreciate the size of the disruption. Some of the market moves during the period were staggering, particularly in interest rates. To give you a sense of the magnitude, there have been just four days in the past 25 years that have seen two-year yields move by 50 basis points or more intraday . One was in September 2008 and three of them occurred in mid-March this year . Monday , March 13th was the biggest one-day move in the U.S. Treasury two-year yield in over 35 years. As we sit here today , it appears that the worst of the volatility is behind us. Prompt action by regulators was vital in bolstering conﬁdence and stabilizing market sentiment. The events of the ﬁrst quarter acted as another real-life stress test and they demonstrated the resilience of the country's largest ﬁnancial institutions. The G-SIBs have been a source of strength for the ﬁnancial system. W e joined a consortium with 10 other large institutions in making a $30 billion uninsured term deposit into First Republic Bank to send the strong vote of conﬁdence in and commitment to the U.S. banking sector . As for Goldman Sachs, our long-standing and deeply rooted risk management culture helped us navigate this unusual environment. In our 154-year history , we have lived and managed through many periods of disruption, and it's our rigorous processes and planning for tailored scenarios before the stress that enable us to react quickly and ef fectively when they do occur . While it's impossible to predict the exact form a market stress will take and we won't always execute perfectly , our risk management culture, strong liquidity , and robust capital position have allowed us to navigate a complex environment while also continuing to actively support our clients. Given this backdrop, it was clear our clients needed help managing their risks and turn to us for our expertise and execution capabilities. Both FICC and Equities had a strong quarter , as we helped clients with their intermediation and ﬁnancing needs. Underwriting activity , however , remained extremely muted and below recent averages as capital markets were further delayed from reopening in a meaningful way given the market disruption. All-in, Global Banking & Markets delivered industry- leading returns of 16.6%, in line with our through-the-cycle targets even while advisory and capital markets activity remained muted. This franchise continues to show impressive resilience in a variety of market environments, given our broad and diversiﬁed set of businesses. Management fees across Asset & W ealth Management grew sequentially , but segment returns were in the mid-single-digits as our on-balance sheet investments remained susceptible to volatility in asset prices. It is a strategic priority to continue to reduce these positions. And while we've made progress, there is still work to do. In Platform Solutions, we saw positive underlying trends this quarter with revenues greater than provisions and we remain focused on driving this business towards proﬁtability . We also continue to explore strategic alternatives within our consumer platform businesses. In the ﬁrst quarter , we sold a portion of our Marcus loan portfolio and transferred the remainder to held-for-sale. While this activity is now reﬂected in our AWM segment, it is an example of our narrowing our focus in the consumer space. Denis will take you through the ﬁnancial impact of that momentarily . Additionally , we are now initiating the process to explore the sale of GreenSky . We believe GreenSky is a good business and is performing well with ﬁrst quarter originations in our core home improvement loans up over 25% year-over-year and a weighted FICO on total originations of over 780. Given our current strategic priorities however , we may not be the best long-term holder of this business. W e will update you on our progress if and when there are material developments. As I close, I'd like to say a few words about the forward outlook. The recent events in the banking sector are lowering growth expectations and there is a higher risk of a credit contraction given the environment is limiting banks' appetites to extend credit. This is an acceleration of a trend and a situation we're watching closely . Businesses and consumers continue to adjust to higher interest rates. While the forward trajectory is still unclear , we continue to be cautious about the economic outlook and we are operating the ﬁrm such that we are well prepared in the event that the environment weakens further . Overall, I feel very conﬁdent about the state of our client franchise and the long-term opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. As the events of the past quarter have illustrated, we are operating from a position of strength and we have the people in place around the world to continue serving the broad range of clients' needs with excellence. And while much has transpired since we held our Investor Day at the end of February , we remain focused on our strategy to strengthen our leading Global Banking & Markets franchise and grow our Asset & W ealth Management business, and we are committed to delivering for clients and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover our ﬁnancial results for the quarter in more detail.
 Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page one of the presentation. In the ﬁrst quarter , we generated net revenues of $12.2 billion and net earnings of $3.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $8.79. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $8.4 billion in the ﬁrst quarter , which generated an industry- leading ROE for the segment of 16.6%. Advisory revenues of $818 million were down 27% amid lower industry completions. Underwriting revenues continued to be below recent averages and were lower year-over-year . Despite the difﬁcult backdrop, we were number one in the league tables for completed M&A  and high-yield debt underwriting. W e also ranked second for equity and equity-related underwriting. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter , primarily in Advisory , but we remain cautiously optimistic on the outlook for the second half of the year and 2024, particularly for strategic M&A. W e also expect investors will need more certainty before ﬁnancing markets reopen broadly , but we have seen an increase in underwriting dialogs in the ﬁrst two weeks of the second quarter . FICC net revenues were $3.9 billion in the quarter , down 17%, as one of our strongest sets of results in rates was more than of fset by signiﬁcantly lower currencies and commodities revenues, which were very strong in the ﬁrst quarter of 2022. In FICC ﬁnancing, revenues rose slightly year-over-year . Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter , down 7% year-on-year . A decline in intermediation revenues was partially of fset by record ﬁnancing revenues of $1.3 billion with the sequential increase driven by higher activity and increased balances coupled with improved customer spreads. Moving to Asset & W ealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.2 billion rose 24% year-over-year , given improved results in equity and debt investments, and as management and other fees increased 12% year-over-year to a record $2.3 billion. Though underlying trends in the business remained strong, private banking and lending revenues of $354 million fell year-over-year , driven by the partial sale of our Marcus unsecured loan portfolio as well as a transfer of the remaining portfolio to held-for-sale, in line with our strategic decision to narrow our consumer ambitions. The associated revenue reduction of $470 million was largely of fset by a reserve release of $440 million. Additionally , we beneﬁted from NII and incremental reserve releases associated with paydowns. All-in, the Marcus loan portfolio was proﬁtable for the quarter . Net revenues for equity investments were $1 19 million, driven by $229 million in revenues related to CIEs and $85 million of gains related to our $2 billion public portfolio, partially of fset by $195 million of net losses on our $12 billion private equity portfolio, primarily within real estate. This quarter , we experienced approximately $355 million of impairments on our CIE portfolio, which are reﬂected in operating expenses. Debt investments revenues were $408 million, driven by net interest income of $363 million. Moving on to Page 6, total ﬁrmwide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.7 trillion, driven by $68 billion of market appreciation as well as $8 billion of long-term net inﬂows, representing our 21st consecutive quarter of long-term fee- based inﬂows. W e also saw a meaningful strength in liquidity products with $49 billion of net inﬂows from new and existing clients amid the industry-wide ﬂows in the money market funds. Turning to Page 7 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $268 billion at the end of the ﬁrst quarter , driving $494 million in management and other fees for the quarter . Gross third-party fundraising was $14 billion, relatively solid given the current environment, and bringing total third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day to $193 billion. While we expect the pace of fundraising to slow for the rest of 2023, we continue to feel good about the path forward and remain conﬁdent in achieving our 2024 target of $225 billion. On balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $57 billion, of which $27 billion was related to our historical principal investment portfolio. Despite the challenging environment, we reduced these on balance sheet historical investments by $2.3 billion in the quarter . We are committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density , including reducing historical principal investment portfolio to less than $15 billion by 2024 year-end. I'll now turn to Platform Solutions on Page 8. Revenues of $564 million more than doubled year-over-year , driven by growth in loan balances in consumer platforms. This week, we announced the launch of a savings account for Apple Card users. W e are excited to deepen our partnership with Apple through this additional of fering and to introduce another source of deposit funding for the ﬁrm. In transaction banking, deposit balances ended the quarter slightly higher versus year-end, while revenues of $74 million were modestly lower quarter-over-quarter amid higher deposit costs. As we spoke about at our Investor Day in February , we're focused on further scaling this business with new clients and deepening our relationships with existing clients as we aspire to become their primary service provider . In this regard, we continue to see positive momentum on the platform as our client count grew by approximately 20% in the ﬁrst quarter . On Page 9, ﬁrmwide net interest income of $1.8 billion in the ﬁrst quarter was down 14% relative to the fourth quarter , driven by increased funding costs supporting training activities within Global Banking & Markets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $178 billion, essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter . Provision for credit losses reﬂected a net beneﬁt of $171 million, including the previously mentioned reserve release associated with the Marcus unsecured lending portfolio and model updates, which were only partially of fset by roughly $245 million in consumer net charge-of fs. Spending a moment on our commercial real estate lending portfolio, as of quarter- end, we had $29 billion of funded CRE loans. This portfolio is diversiﬁed by property type and includes $10 billion of exposure in the form of conservatively structured warehouse lending with typical L TVs of approximately 50%. Turning to expenses on Page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.4 billion. Our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was 33%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.3 billion, essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter , but up versus last year . The majority of the year-over-year increase was driven by the aforementioned CIE impairments as well as expenses related to NNIP . Our ef fective tax rate for the quarter was 19%. For the full year , we expect a tax rate between 21% and 22%. Turning to capital on Slide 1 1. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.8% at the end of the ﬁrst quarter under the standardized approach, 100 basis points above our current requirement and at the top end of our management buf fer. In the quarter , we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of over $2.5 billion and common stock dividends of roughly $870 million. While we expect to continue to focus on sustainably growing our dividend, we would note that repurchases in any given quarter will vary . Though we ﬁnd our stock price attractive at current levels in light of the current environment, we expect to moderate our repurchase levels in the second quarter relative to the ﬁrst quarter . In conclusion, our ﬁrst quarter results were solid in the context of a volatile environment. Our robust ﬁnancial position allowed us to focus on serving our clients and helping them navigate this period of market disruption. Across our leading businesses in Global Banking & Markets and Asset & W ealth Management, we remain well positioned to continue to support our clients and execute on our strategic priorities. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.","While it's impossible to predict the exact form a market stress will take and we won't always execute perfectly , our risk management culture, strong liquidity , and robust capital position have allowed us to navigate a complex environment while also continuing to actively support our clients.
In Platform Solutions, we saw positive underlying trends this quarter with revenues greater than provisions and we remain focused on driving this business towards proﬁtability .
We believe GreenSky is a good business and is performing well with ﬁrst quarter originations in our core home improvement loans up over 25% year-over-year and a weighted FICO on total originations of over 780.
And while much has transpired since we held our Investor Day at the end of February , we remain focused on our strategy to strengthen our leading Global Banking & Markets franchise and grow our Asset & W ealth Management business, and we are committed to delivering for clients and shareholders.
In the ﬁrst quarter , we generated net revenues of $12.2 billion and net earnings of $3.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $8.79.
Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $8.4 billion in the ﬁrst quarter , which generated an industry- leading ROE for the segment of 16.6%.
W e also expect investors will need more certainty before ﬁnancing markets reopen broadly , but we have seen an increase in underwriting dialogs in the ﬁrst two weeks of the second quarter .
FICC net revenues were $3.9 billion in the quarter , down 17%, as one of our strongest sets of results in rates was more than of fset by signiﬁcantly lower currencies and commodities revenues, which were very strong in the ﬁrst quarter of 2022.
Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter , down 7% year-on-year .
Revenues of $3.2 billion rose 24% year-over-year , given improved results in equity and debt investments, and as management and other fees increased 12% year-over-year to a record $2.3 billion.
Though underlying trends in the business remained strong, private banking and lending revenues of $354 million fell year-over-year , driven by the partial sale of our Marcus unsecured loan portfolio as well as a transfer of the remaining portfolio to held-for-sale, in line with our strategic decision to narrow our consumer ambitions.
Net revenues for equity investments were $1 19 million, driven by $229 million in revenues related to CIEs and $85 million of gains related to our $2 billion public portfolio, partially of fset by $195 million of net losses on our $12 billion private equity portfolio, primarily within real estate.
Moving on to Page 6, total ﬁrmwide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.7 trillion, driven by $68 billion of market appreciation as well as $8 billion of long-term net inﬂows, representing our 21st consecutive quarter of long-term fee- based inﬂows.
W e also saw a meaningful strength in liquidity products with $49 billion of net inﬂows from new and existing clients amid the industry-wide ﬂows in the money market funds.
Alternative assets under supervision totaled $268 billion at the end of the ﬁrst quarter , driving $494 million in management and other fees for the quarter .
Despite the challenging environment, we reduced these on balance sheet historical investments by $2.3 billion in the quarter .
In transaction banking, deposit balances ended the quarter slightly higher versus year-end, while revenues of $74 million were modestly lower quarter-over-quarter amid higher deposit costs.

This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations and Chief Strategy Ofﬁcer , Goldman Sachs. W elcome to our ﬁrst quarter earnings conference call. Today we will reference our earnings presentation, which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www .gs.com. Note information on forward- looking statements and non-GAAP  measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced, or rebroadcast without our consent. I am joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , David Solomon, and our Chief Financial Ofﬁcer , Denis Coleman. Let me pass the call to David.
 Thanks, Carey , and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. In the ﬁrst quarter , we delivered solid performance in a challenging environment. W e produced net revenues of $12.2 billion and generated earnings per share of $8.79 and an ROE of 1 1.6% and an ROTE of 12.6%. The ﬁrst quarter was certainly volatile, particularly for the banking sector . After a fairly benign operating environment at the start of the year , in March, we witnessed the collapse of two regional banks in the United States. Stress quickly spread to a number of institutions across the ﬁnancial sector where we saw ratings downgrades and steep valuation declines in very short order . These stresses were not limited to the U.S., as we saw when regulators help arrange the combination of Switzerland's two largest ﬁnancial institutions. It's important to appreciate the size of the disruption. Some of the market moves during the period were staggering, particularly in interest rates. To give you a sense of the magnitude, there have been just four days in the past 25 years that have seen two-year yields move by 50 basis points or more intraday . One was in September 2008 and three of them occurred in mid-March this year . Monday , March 13th was the biggest one-day move in the U.S. Treasury two-year yield in over 35 years. As we sit here today , it appears that the worst of the volatility is behind us. Prompt action by regulators was vital in bolstering conﬁdence and stabilizing market sentiment. The events of the ﬁrst quarter acted as another real-life stress test and they demonstrated the resilience of the country's largest ﬁnancial institutions. The G-SIBs have been a source of strength for the ﬁnancial system. W e joined a consortium with 10 other large institutions in making a $30 billion uninsured term deposit into First Republic Bank to send the strong vote of conﬁdence in and commitment to the U.S. banking sector . As for Goldman Sachs, our long-standing and deeply rooted risk management culture helped us navigate this unusual environment. In our 154-year history , we have lived and managed through many periods of disruption, and it's our rigorous processes and planning for tailored scenarios before the stress that enable us to react quickly and ef fectively when they do occur . While it's impossible to predict the exact form a market stress will take and we won't always execute perfectly , our risk management culture, strong liquidity , and robust capital position have allowed us to navigate a complex environment while also continuing to actively support our clients. Given this backdrop, it was clear our clients needed help managing their risks and turn to us for our expertise and execution capabilities. Both FICC and Equities had a strong quarter , as we helped clients with their intermediation and ﬁnancing needs. Underwriting activity , however , remained extremely muted and below recent averages as capital markets were further delayed from reopening in a meaningful way given the market disruption. All-in, Global Banking & Markets delivered industry- leading returns of 16.6%, in line with our through-the-cycle targets even while advisory and capital markets activity remained muted. This franchise continues to show impressive resilience in a variety of market environments, given our broad and diversiﬁed set of businesses. Management fees across Asset & W ealth Management grew sequentially , but segment returns were in the mid-single-digits as our on-balance sheet investments remained susceptible to volatility in asset prices. It is a strategic priority to continue to reduce these positions. And while we've made progress, there is still work to do. In Platform Solutions, we saw positive underlying trends this quarter with revenues greater than provisions and we remain focused on driving this business towards proﬁtability . We also continue to explore strategic alternatives within our consumer platform businesses. In the ﬁrst quarter , we sold a portion of our Marcus loan portfolio and transferred the remainder to held-for-sale. While this activity is now reﬂected in our AWM segment, it is an example of our narrowing our focus in the consumer space. Denis will take you through the ﬁnancial impact of that momentarily . Additionally , we are now initiating the process to explore the sale of GreenSky . We believe GreenSky is a good business and is performing well with ﬁrst quarter originations in our core home improvement loans up over 25% year-over-year and a weighted FICO on total originations of over 780. Given our current strategic priorities however , we may not be the best long-term holder of this business. W e will update you on our progress if and when there are material developments. As I close, I'd like to say a few words about the forward outlook. The recent events in the banking sector are lowering growth expectations and there is a higher risk of a credit contraction given the environment is limiting banks' appetites to extend credit. This is an acceleration of a trend and a situation we're watching closely . Businesses and consumers continue to adjust to higher interest rates. While the forward trajectory is still unclear , we continue to be cautious about the economic outlook and we are operating the ﬁrm such that we are well prepared in the event that the environment weakens further . Overall, I feel very conﬁdent about the state of our client franchise and the long-term opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. As the events of the past quarter have illustrated, we are operating from a position of strength and we have the people in place around the world to continue serving the broad range of clients' needs with excellence. And while much has transpired since we held our Investor Day at the end of February , we remain focused on our strategy to strengthen our leading Global Banking & Markets franchise and grow our Asset & W ealth Management business, and we are committed to delivering for clients and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover our ﬁnancial results for the quarter in more detail.
 Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page one of the presentation. In the ﬁrst quarter , we generated net revenues of $12.2 billion and net earnings of $3.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $8.79. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $8.4 billion in the ﬁrst quarter , which generated an industry- leading ROE for the segment of 16.6%. Advisory revenues of $818 million were down 27% amid lower industry completions. Underwriting revenues continued to be below recent averages and were lower year-over-year . Despite the difﬁcult backdrop, we were number one in the league tables for completed M&A  and high-yield debt underwriting. W e also ranked second for equity and equity-related underwriting. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter , primarily in Advisory , but we remain cautiously optimistic on the outlook for the second half of the year and 2024, particularly for strategic M&A. W e also expect investors will need more certainty before ﬁnancing markets reopen broadly , but we have seen an increase in underwriting dialogs in the ﬁrst two weeks of the second quarter . FICC net revenues were $3.9 billion in the quarter , down 17%, as one of our strongest sets of results in rates was more than of fset by signiﬁcantly lower currencies and commodities revenues, which were very strong in the ﬁrst quarter of 2022. In FICC ﬁnancing, revenues rose slightly year-over-year . Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter , down 7% year-on-year . A decline in intermediation revenues was partially of fset by record ﬁnancing revenues of $1.3 billion with the sequential increase driven by higher activity and increased balances coupled with improved customer spreads. Moving to Asset & W ealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.2 billion rose 24% year-over-year , given improved results in equity and debt investments, and as management and other fees increased 12% year-over-year to a record $2.3 billion. Though underlying trends in the business remained strong, private banking and lending revenues of $354 million fell year-over-year , driven by the partial sale of our Marcus unsecured loan portfolio as well as a transfer of the remaining portfolio to held-for-sale, in line with our strategic decision to narrow our consumer ambitions. The associated revenue reduction of $470 million was largely of fset by a reserve release of $440 million. Additionally , we beneﬁted from NII and incremental reserve releases associated with paydowns. All-in, the Marcus loan portfolio was proﬁtable for the quarter . Net revenues for equity investments were $1 19 million, driven by $229 million in revenues related to CIEs and $85 million of gains related to our $2 billion public portfolio, partially of fset by $195 million of net losses on our $12 billion private equity portfolio, primarily within real estate. This quarter , we experienced approximately $355 million of impairments on our CIE portfolio, which are reﬂected in operating expenses. Debt investments revenues were $408 million, driven by net interest income of $363 million. Moving on to Page 6, total ﬁrmwide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.7 trillion, driven by $68 billion of market appreciation as well as $8 billion of long-term net inﬂows, representing our 21st consecutive quarter of long-term fee- based inﬂows. W e also saw a meaningful strength in liquidity products with $49 billion of net inﬂows from new and existing clients amid the industry-wide ﬂows in the money market funds. Turning to Page 7 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $268 billion at the end of the ﬁrst quarter , driving $494 million in management and other fees for the quarter . Gross third-party fundraising was $14 billion, relatively solid given the current environment, and bringing total third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day to $193 billion. While we expect the pace of fundraising to slow for the rest of 2023, we continue to feel good about the path forward and remain conﬁdent in achieving our 2024 target of $225 billion. On balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $57 billion, of which $27 billion was related to our historical principal investment portfolio. Despite the challenging environment, we reduced these on balance sheet historical investments by $2.3 billion in the quarter . We are committed to our strategy to reduce balance sheet density , including reducing historical principal investment portfolio to less than $15 billion by 2024 year-end. I'll now turn to Platform Solutions on Page 8. Revenues of $564 million more than doubled year-over-year , driven by growth in loan balances in consumer platforms. This week, we announced the launch of a savings account for Apple Card users. W e are excited to deepen our partnership with Apple through this additional of fering and to introduce another source of deposit funding for the ﬁrm. In transaction banking, deposit balances ended the quarter slightly higher versus year-end, while revenues of $74 million were modestly lower quarter-over-quarter amid higher deposit costs. As we spoke about at our Investor Day in February , we're focused on further scaling this business with new clients and deepening our relationships with existing clients as we aspire to become their primary service provider . In this regard, we continue to see positive momentum on the platform as our client count grew by approximately 20% in the ﬁrst quarter . On Page 9, ﬁrmwide net interest income of $1.8 billion in the ﬁrst quarter was down 14% relative to the fourth quarter , driven by increased funding costs supporting training activities within Global Banking & Markets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $178 billion, essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter . Provision for credit losses reﬂected a net beneﬁt of $171 million, including the previously mentioned reserve release associated with the Marcus unsecured lending portfolio and model updates, which were only partially of fset by roughly $245 million in consumer net charge-of fs. Spending a moment on our commercial real estate lending portfolio, as of quarter- end, we had $29 billion of funded CRE loans. This portfolio is diversiﬁed by property type and includes $10 billion of exposure in the form of conservatively structured warehouse lending with typical L TVs of approximately 50%. Turning to expenses on Page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.4 billion. Our compensation ratio for the quarter net of provisions was 33%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.3 billion, essentially unchanged versus the fourth quarter , but up versus last year . The majority of the year-over-year increase was driven by the aforementioned CIE impairments as well as expenses related to NNIP . Our ef fective tax rate for the quarter was 19%. For the full year , we expect a tax rate between 21% and 22%. Turning to capital on Slide 1 1. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.8% at the end of the ﬁrst quarter under the standardized approach, 100 basis points above our current requirement and at the top end of our management buf fer. In the quarter , we returned $3.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of over $2.5 billion and common stock dividends of roughly $870 million. While we expect to continue to focus on sustainably growing our dividend, we would note that repurchases in any given quarter will vary . Though we ﬁnd our stock price attractive at current levels in light of the current environment, we expect to moderate our repurchase levels in the second quarter relative to the ﬁrst quarter . In conclusion, our ﬁrst quarter results were solid in the context of a volatile environment.

2023_Q2," Thank you. Good morning. This is Carey Halio, Head of Investor Relations and Chief Strategy Ofﬁcer at Goldman Sachs. W elcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. Today , we will reference our earnings presentation which can be found on the Investor Relations page of our website at www .gs.com. Note, information on forward- looking statements and non-GAAP  measures appear on the earnings release and presentation. This audiocast is copyrighted material of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and may not be duplicated, reproduced or rebroadcast without our consent. I'm joined today by our Chairman and Chief Executive Ofﬁcer , David Solomon; and our Chief Financial Ofﬁcer , Denis Solomon. Let me pass the call to David.
 Thank you, Carey and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. This quarter , we produced net revenues of $10.9 billion and generated earnings per share of $3.08, an ROE of 4% and an ROTE of 4.4%. Our results were impacted by several items related to businesses we are executing on a strategic transition and positioning the ﬁrm for the future. In particular , shifting our asset wealth management business to a less capital-intensive model and the pivot to narrow our consumer ambition. All in, these items reduced our EPS for the second quarter by $3.95 and our ROE by 5.2 percentage points. Our results were also impacted by the challenging macro environment and in particular , headwinds facing our speciﬁc mix of businesses. Activity levels in many areas of investment banking hover near decade-long lows and clients largely maintained a risk-of f posture over the course of the quarter . CEOs around the world continue to be cautious as businesses grapple with persistent inﬂation, geopolitical tensions and slower growth. But we know the corporate activity and capital formation are core to our ﬁnancial system and there are a number of structural catalysts that should lead to increased levels of activity . And we're seeing it begin to pick up in a few spots already , particularly equity capital markets and M&A dialogue. There's no question, recent economic data in the U.S. indicates the Fed's efforts to ﬁght inﬂation are showing progress and we are starting to see more optimism about the forward trajectory . However the year unfolds, we stand ready to help our clients navigate the evolving backdrop while maintaining a prudent risk posture and operating the ﬁrm more efﬁciently . Importantly , we laid out a clear set of strategic goals at our Investor Day in February and we are in execution mode. W e have 2 incredibly strong client franchises a world- class global banking and markets business, we continue to deliver solid returns even in an environment with reduced activity levels and a scaled asset and wealth management platform that continues to show very strong underlying trends aligned with our Investor Day goals with growth and more recurring revenues of management and other fees and private banking and lending. These businesses are supported by a number of things. First, a long track record of serving the world's leading businesses, institutions and individuals, building relationships as a trusted adviser is core to what Goldman Sachs does. Next, the client-centric mindset. Over the last 5 years, we have strengthened our ef forts to bring to bear the best of the ﬁrm's capabilities and holistically serve clients with our One Goldman Sachs operating ethos. Client feedback continues to be highly encouraging and we see opportunities to make further gains. We also have a global, broad and deep platform with capabilities that span across products, geographies and solutions a key dif ferentiator of value to our clients around the world. W e have exceptional people. They are dif ferentiated and they work hard to make a dif ference for our clients. And lastly , this is all underpinned by a culture of collaboration and excellence. W e are also pleased that our strategy to reduce the capital intensity of our business is resulting in sustained multiyear progress. Starting in October our SCB will be reduced by 80 basis points to 5.5% giving us greater ﬂexibility to deploy our capital. W e continue to execute on the $30 billion share repurchase program we announced in February and we recently announced a 10% increase to our quarterly dividend. W e have made it a priority to grow our dividend to a competitive rate. And since the beginning of 2019, we have more than tripled our dividend from $0.80 to $2.75 per share per quarter . Given our ongoing strategic ef forts to lower the ﬁrm's capital density and reduce earnings volatility , we are well positioned to grow it further . As I said, we are laser focused on executing on our strategy . This moment in the economic cycle creates meaningful headwinds for Goldman Sachs and our business mix. At the same time, we are making tough decisions that are driving the strategic evolution of the ﬁrm. Given both these factors, it should come as no surprise that we're going to a period of lower results. I remain fully conﬁdent that we will deliver on our through-the-cycle targets of mid-teens returns on at signiﬁcant value for shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Denis to cover our ﬁnancial results for the quarter in more detail.
 Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the second quarter , we generated net revenues of $10.9 billion and net earnings of $1.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $3.08. As David mentioned, we have provided additional detail this quarter on 3 items that impacted our results. These items are a gain in connection with our sale process for the market's unsecured loan portfolio as well as the business' operating results. Losses from our historical principal investments within Asset and W ealth Management and results related to GreenSky , including a goodwill impairment in consumer platforms. In aggregate, for the second quarter , these 3 items impacted net earnings by $1.4 billion and reduced our EPS by $3.95 and our ROE by 5.2 percentage points. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Page 4; Global Banking and Markets produced revenues of $7.2 billion in the second quarter . Advisory revenues of $645 million were down versus a strong prior year period amid signiﬁcantly lower industry completions. Equity underwriting revenues rose year-over-year to $338 million as we saw some signs of reopening in the capital markets, although volumes continue to remain well below medium and long-term averages. Debt underwriting revenues were slightly down versus the second quarter of 2022 as activity remains muted. Nonetheless, our client franchise remains very strong and we remain well positioned to support the needs of our clients. We ranked number one in the league tables across announced and completed M&A as well as equity underwriting and high-yield debt on a year-to-date basis. Additionally , our backlog rose quarter-on-quarter , primarily in advisory . FICC net revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter as clients remained in a risk-of f posture, relative to an active prior year quarter , particularly in commodities, rates and currencies. FICC ﬁnancing revenues were $622 million. Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter , roughly ﬂat year-on-year . Equities ﬁnancing revenues were a record $1.4 billion as we beneﬁted from our ongoing strategic focus and increased balances. This was largely of fset by a decline in intermediation revenues, primarily in derivatives. Our strategic priority to grow ﬁnancing across both FICC and equities continues to yield results as these activities increase the durability of our revenue base and we continue to see attractive deployment opportunities to support further growth. Moving to Asset & W ealth Management on Page 5; revenues of $3 billion were down 4% year-over-year , primarily driven by weaker results in equity and debt investments. Management and other fees increased 5% year-over-year to a record $2.4 billion, largely driven by higher assets under supervision. Private Banking and lending revenues were also a record at $874 million. W e continue to see positive momentum in this business as we beneﬁt from higher deposit balances and NII. Results were supported by a gain of approximately $100 million related to the sale of substantially all of the remaining Marcus loans portfolio. Equity investments generated losses of $403 million. More speciﬁcally , we had roughly $305 million of net losses in our private portfolio, primarily due to markdowns on investments in ofﬁce-related commercial real estate and approximately $100 million of net losses in our public portfolio, largely driven by a loss related to a historical principal investment that we sold out of during the quarter . Importantly , we have now reduced the public portfolio to approximately $1 billion, down from more than $4.5 billion in 2021. Debt investments revenues were $197 million, with the year-over-year decline driven by weaker performance in real estate investments. This quarter , we also experienced approximately $485 million of impairments on our real estate-related CIE portfolio which are reﬂected in operating expenses. In aggregate, the results from Marcus loans and the losses from our historical principal investments negatively impacted our margins for the segment by approximately 15 percentage points for the ﬁrst half of the year . Now moving to Page 6; total ﬁrmwide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.7 trillion, driven by $30 billion of market appreciation as well as $8 billion of long-term net inﬂows representing our 22nd consecutive quarter of long-term fee- based inﬂows. Turning now to Page 7 on alternatives; alternative assets under supervision totaled $267 billion at the end of the second quarter , driving $521 million in management and other fees for the quarter . Gross third-party fundraising was $1 1 billion for the quarter and $25 billion for the ﬁrst half of the year . Total third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day is now over $200 billion and remains very well positioned to achieve our 2024 target of $225 billion. On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $53 billion, of which $24 billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio. In the second quarter , we reduced this portfolio by $3.6 billion which included sales of a number of CRE-related investments, bringing year-to-date reductions to approximately $6 billion and putting us well on pace to achieve our 2024 year-end target of a historical principal investment portfolio below $15 billion. Next, Platform Solutions on Page 8; revenues were $659 million, driven by growth in loan balances and consumer platforms. As noted earlier , we took a $504 million impairment charge on the goodwill associated with consumer platforms this quarter in connection our exploration of a potential sale of the GreenSky business. W e will continue to evaluate its intangibles for impairment and should we decide to sell the business, we will also make a determination regarding moving Greensky to held for sale, similar to the action we took last quarter with respect to our markets unsecured loan portfolio. We will share further updates as appropriate. Additionally , you'll recall that at our Investor Day earlier this year , we said that we expected to reduce the efﬁciency ratio in Platform Solutions below 100% by the end of this year and we are making progress. Absent the impact of the goodwill impairment in consumer platforms, the efﬁciency ratio for the segment year-to-date would have been better than our stated goal. On Page 9, ﬁrm-wide net interest income was $1.7 billion in the second quarter . Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $178 billion, unchanged versus the prior quarter . For the second quarter , our provision for credit losses was $615 million. Provisions in the quarter were primarily due to continued growth and higher net charge-of fs in our lending portfolio within consumer platforms. Additionally , within our wholesale portfolio, impairments and a reserve build were partially of fset by releases due to lower balances. Moving on to Page 10; we've added a new slide this quarter , providing additional detail on our CRE exposure. Starting with the left side of the page, CRE loans represent a relatively small percentage of our overall lending book, roughly 15%. And we are well diversiﬁed by property type with only 1% in the ofﬁce category . Moving to the right side of the page, you can see additional detail on our CRE-related on- balance sheet alternative investments. W e conducted a comprehensive asset-by- asset review of this portfolio this quarter and we have incorporated the feedback from our sell-down process. Ofﬁce-related exposure represents approximately 2% of the aggregate portfolio and equity securities loans and debt securities and approximately 15% of the CIE investments in other category net of ﬁnancings. Overall, the CRE investments are diversiﬁed across geographies and positions with no single position representing more than 1% of the total on-balance sheet alternative investments. Furthermore, 50% of these investments are historical principal investments that we intend to exit over the medium term. W e continue to remain highly focused on the overall risk management of this portfolio. Turning to expenses on Page 1 1; total quarterly operating expenses were $8.5 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio net of provisions is 34% which includes approximately $260 million of year-to-date state severance costs. At Investor Day in February , we articulated this year and we have now largely reached this organ with line of sight to surpass it. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.9 billion. The increase in our non- compensation expense was entirely driven by the CIE and goodwill impairments I discussed previously . Absent these items, non-comp expense is down for the second consecutive quarter , even in the face of inﬂationary headwinds. Our ef fective tax rate for the ﬁrst half of '20 was an increase in taxes on non-U.S. earnings. For the full year, we expect a tax rate of roughly 22%. Next, capital on Slide 12. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.9% at the end of the second quarter under the standardized approach which is 190 basis points over our new 13% requirement that will become applicable in October . As David mentioned, we are pleased with the results of the recent stress test and remain conﬁdent that our strategy to reduce the capital density of our business will continue to help improve our SEB over time. The 80 basis point reduction in our SEB will allow us to continue to remain nimble in dynamically deploying capital to support our client franchise. In the quarter , we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $750 million and common stock dividends of $864 million. Our Board has also approved a 10% increase in our dividend, to $2.75 per share beginning in the third quarter . This increase will enable us to pay our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and maintain a competitive yield, complemented by our previously announced $30 million share repurchase program where we intend to step up the level of buybacks going forward. In conclusion, our second quarter results reﬂect a challenging backdrop as well as our ongoing execution of several strategic actions. These initiatives will help transition our business and improve our overall return proﬁle. W e remain conﬁdent in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunities set for Goldman Sachs. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.","This quarter , we produced net revenues of $10.9 billion and generated earnings per share of $3.08, an ROE of 4% and an ROTE of 4.4%.

 Thank you, Carey and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. This quarter , we produced net revenues of $10.9 billion and generated earnings per share of $3.08, an ROE of 4% and an ROTE of 4.4%. Our results were impacted by several items related to businesses we are executing on a strategic transition and positioning the ﬁrm for the future. In particular , shifting our asset wealth management business to a less capital-intensive model and the pivot to narrow our consumer ambition. All in, these items reduced our EPS for the second quarter by $3.95 and our ROE by 5.2 percentage points. Our results were also impacted by the challenging macro environment and in particular , headwinds facing our speciﬁc mix of businesses. Activity levels in many areas of investment banking hover near decade-long lows and clients largely maintained a risk-of f posture over the course of the quarter .

2023_Q3," Thank you very much, and good morning, everybody . Thank you all for joining us. Before I start my prepared remarks, I'd just like to take a moment to address the horriﬁc events in the Middle East. We condemn the terrorist attacks against Israel on the strongest possible terms and are heartbroken by the loss of so many innocent lives. This is clearly an extremely difﬁcult and uncertain time for the region, and it's very concerning for many of us around the world. W e obviously will continue to watch closely as this crisis unfolds. Earlier this month, I marked the end of my ﬁfth year as the CEO of Goldman Sachs. I've never felt more optimistic about the ﬁrm, and our strategy has never been more clear . We operate two core businesses, our market-leading Global Banking & Markets franchise, and our growing Asset & W ealth Management platform, both of which are being positioned to deliver mid-teen returns through the cycle. As I reﬂect on the past ﬁve years, much of what has always made Goldman Sachs extraordinary remains the same, long track record of being a trusted adviser to the world's leading businesses, institutions and individuals. A global broad and deep platform with capabilities that span across products, geographies and solutions, an aspirational brand, exceptional people and a culture of collaboration and excellence. Additionally , over this time, we have evolved the organization by institutionalizing a One Goldman Sachs operating ethos. This approach, coupled with our best-in-class talent, advice and execution capabilities has strengthened and solidiﬁed our leadership position across our businesses. As we sit here today , our client franchise is as strong as ever , enabling us to remain at the center of the most complex and important transactions for our clients. For example, the IPO market has started to reopen. Since Labor Day , there have been four marquee IPOs priced in the United States, Arm Holdings, Instacart, Klaviyo and Birkenstock. Goldman Sachs was lead left on three of those four and the joint lead book runner on the fourth. No other bank can make that claim. Being entrusted to help companies navigate the critical transition of coming to market requires long-standing client relationships, deep market expertise and experience. Given the execution of these transactions, I'm encouraged by the prospects of a wider reopening of capital markets. If conditions remain conducive, I expect the continued recovery for both capital markets and strategic activity . As a leader in M&A advisory and equity underwriting, a resurgence in activity would be a tail [indiscernible] of Goldman Sachs. In Asset & W ealth Management, our strategy is working as evidenced by the successes we've seen across our franchise. While some active asset managers have faced quarterly outﬂows over the last few years, we posted our 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inﬂows. We generated record management and other fees of $2.4 billion and are well on our way of achieving our $10 billion annual target to 2024. W e are also ahead of pace on our $2 billion target for alternative management fees. While market-leading client franchise allows us to execute from a position of strength, we know we still have work ahead of us. Earlier this year at Investor Day , we laid out a clear set of goals to narrow our strategic focus, and we have made signiﬁcant progress on these priorities. Most recently , we announced the sale of GreenSky . We also announced the sale of Personal Financial Management this summer . We sold substantially all of our markets loan portfolio. W e have reduced our historical principal investments by $9 billion this year . We are conﬁdent that the work we're doing now provides us a stronger platform for 2024 and beyond. As we assess the operating backdrop, the US economy has proven to be more resilient than expected, though there are reasons to remain vigilant. Treasury rates have risen sharply over the past few months with 10-year yields up 75 basis points in the third quarter . On top of that, recent inﬂation and employment data has come in above estimates, driving market expectations of higher for longer interest rates. And there still are a number of sectors in the economy that have yet to absorb the impact of higher rates, especially in light of the further tightening in ﬁnancial conditions we've seen over the last quarter . At the same time, there has been an escalation of geopolitical stresses around the globe, the [indiscernible] war in Ukraine, tensions with China and now the conﬂict in the Middle East. Overall levels of risk are more elevated than we've seen in quite some time. While we don't know where this will all lead, it could impact economic growth and stability in the U.S. and around the world, and we remain cautiously positioned. Before I turn it over to Denis, I'd like to spend a moment on Basel III Endgame proposal and reiterate my views on it. W e, of course, support sensible regulation and the desire to ensure we have a safe and sound ﬁnancial system. There are some who have recently said we need to address the lessons from the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, which is driving the needs of much higher regulations. But frankly speaking, the rules, as proposed, go way too far and do not account for the vast array of improvements made by the largest banks as a result of Dodd-Frank and other reforms. Not only have banks doubled capital over the last 15 years, have improved the quality of capital, increased liquidity , simpliﬁed businesses that have been subjected to ongoing annual stress tests. Requiring too much capital will have negative consequences. I believe if these rules are implemented, three things will happen. First, the cost of credit will go up for businesses of all sizes from large corporations to small businesses. Second, more activity will move to the unregulated shadow banking sector . Policies that incentivize a transfer of risk outside the regulated banking system could, in fact, increase systemic risk. And third, US competitiveness will go down. Our capital markets are the deepest and the most liquid in the world. They're the engine of our economy as access to capital allows for innovation and growth across the country . Our competitive standing as the leading global economy would be negatively impacted by this proposal. The net result of these proposed rules would be slower economic growth in the US, material improvement in the -- soundness of the banking system. W e, alongside clients and others in the industry , have been engaging heavily with our regulators and government stakeholders, and given this engagement, we expect that there will be ongoing debate and ultimately , changes to the proposed rules. Though regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical risks remain top of mind, I feel very conﬁdent about the state of our client franchise and the long-term opportunities for Goldman Sachs. We are focused on the execution of our strategy to further strengthen our leading Global Banking & Markets franchise and grow our Asset & W ealth Management business. I feel good about the relative performance in our core business, and we remain ﬁrmly committed to delivering for clients and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover ﬁnancial results for the quarter .
 Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page one of the presentation. In the third quarter , we generated net revenues of $1 1.8 billion and net earnings of $2.1 billion, resulting in a [indiscernible] and a return on equity of 7.1%. As David highlighted, earlier this year , we made the strategic decision to narrow our focus, and we made strong progress across a number of activities. W e provide details on the ﬁnancial impact related to these decisions in the selected items table. In aggregate, these items reduced net earnings by $828 million, EPS by $2.41 and our ROE by 3.1 percentage points. These items include results related to our historical principal investments within Asset & W ealth Management, including the net impact of marks, sell-downs and CIE impairments as well as results relating to GreenSky , which includes the impact of our announced sale and ongoing operating results. Additionally , we highlight modest ongoing losses in connection with our residual markets portfolio and operating the PFM business. Turning to performance by segment, starting on page four . Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $8 billion in the third quarter . Advisory revenues of $831 million were down versus a strong prior year period amid lower completions. Equity underwriting revenues rose year-over-year to $308 million, though industry volumes remained well below medium and longer-term averages. Debt underwriting revenues of $415 million also rose versus the third quarter of 2022. For the year-to- date, we ranked Number One in the league tables across announced and completed M&A  as well as equity underwriting and ranked number two in high-yield debt. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter as we successfully brought transactions to market. Though market conditions are dynamic, client engagement continues to be elevated, and our best-in-class franchise remains well positioned to support the needs of our clients as they access the capital markets. FICC net revenues were $3.4 billion in the quarter , down from a strong performance last year , particularly in currency and commodities and up relative to the second quarter . We produced record FICC ﬁnancing revenues of $730 million grow sequentially on better results within mortgages and structured products. Additionally , we were pleased to win the bids for two pools of Signature Bank's capital call facilities, totaling just over $15 billion in commitments that were held for auction by the FDIC in September . As we spoke about at our Investor Day , alternative asset managers are an attractive client set for us, and the purchase of this portfolio allows us to increase our connectivity with this client base, who we can serve even more holistically with our One Goldman Sachs approach. These activities also enable us to grow durable revenues at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter . Equities intermediation revenues of $1.7 billion rose 7% year-over-year on better performance in derivatives, while equities ﬁnancing revenues of $1.2 billion were lower versus a record in quarter . Total ﬁnancing revenues across FICC and Equities were nearly $6 billion for the year-to-date, representing a record performance for these more durable activities. Our ﬁnancing results, combined with the substantial share gains we've made since our ﬁrst Investor Day are the direct result of the successful execution of our stated strategic priorities for this business. W e are raising the ﬂoor in Global Banking & Markets as reﬂected by our year-to-date ROE of 13.4% despite muted activity levels across Investment Banking. Now moving to Asset & W ealth Management on page ﬁve. Revenues of $3.2 billion were lower year-over-year , primarily driven by weaker results in equity investments. Management and other fees increased 7% year-over-year to a record $2.4 billion, largely driven by higher average assets under supervision. Private banking and lending revenues were $687 million, up slightly year-on-year , as higher deposit balances and spreads were of fset by our sale of substantially all of the market loan portfolio. W e remain very focused on driving growth in the more durable revenue streams of management and other fees as well as private banking and lending, both of which generated record revenues for the year-to-date period. Equity investments generated net losses of $212 million, driven by markdowns on investments in commercial real estate. In aggregate, the losses from our historical principal investments as well as the results for Marcus loans negatively impacted our 6% pre-tax margin for the segment by 18 percentage points for the year-to-date. Now moving to page six. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at $2.7 trillion. W e saw $1 1 billion of liquidity inﬂows and $7 billion of long-term net inﬂows, representing our 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inﬂows. Turning to page seven on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $267 billion at the end of the third quarter , driving $542 million of management and other fees for the quarter . Gross third-party fundraising was $15 billion for the quarter and $40 billion for the year-to-date. We were pleased to announce the close of Goldman Sachs V intage Fund IX in the third quarter , our largest private equity secondaries fund and one of the largest in history at approximately $14 billion. Total third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day is now $219 billion, putting us well on pace to hit our $225 billion target ahead of schedule. On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $49 billion, of which roughly $21 billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio. In the third quarter , we reduced this portfolio by over $3 billion, bringing year-to-date reductions to $9 billion. W e are on track to achieve our 2024 year-end target of a historical principal investment portfolio below $15 billion. Next, Platform Solutions, page eight. Revenues were $578 million, including a $123 million revenue reduction related to the GreenSky loan book, which was more than offset by a $637 million associated reserve release as we moved the portfolio to held for sale. On page nine ﬁrm-wide net interest income was $1.5 billion in the third quarter , down sequentially as increased funding cost supported trading activities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $178 billion, ﬂat with the prior quarter . Our provision for credit losses was $7 million, which reﬂected net charge-of fs in our credit card lending portfolio, of fset by the reserve release I mentioned related to GreenSky . Additionally , within our wholesale portfolio, impairments were partially of fset by a reserve reduction that was driven by increased stability in the macroeconomic environment versus the prior quarter . On page 10, we provide additional detail on our CRE exposure similar to last quarter . CRE loans continue to represent a relatively small percentage of our overall lending book at 14%. CRE investments are diversiﬁed across geographies and positions, with no single position representing more than 1% of the total on-balance sheet alternative investments. Across both equity investments and CIEs, we have marked or impaired ofﬁce-related exposures by approximately 50% this year . Now turning to expenses on page 1 1. Total quarterly operating expenses were $9.1 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio, net of provisions, is 34.5%, inclusive of approximately $275 million of year-to-date severance costs. At Investor Day in February , we articulated a goal of $600 million in run rate payroll efﬁciencies to be achieved in 2023 and 2024 and we are currently tracking to surpass that goal. These efﬁciencies allow us to reinvest in our highest performing people, particularly as the market for top talent remains ﬁercely competitive. Quarterly non-compensation expense were $0.9 billion. The year-over-year increase in noncomp expenses was driven by the write-down of $506 million in the intangibles related to GreenSky as well as CIE impairments of $358 million. While onetime expenses have been elevated for the year-to-date, we continue to focus on bringing down noncomp expenses and are making progress on our $400 million run rate efﬁciency goal. Our ef fective tax rate for the ﬁrst nine months of 2023 was 23.3%, high versus the ﬁrst half due to the write-of f of deferred tax assets related to GreenSky and the geographic mix of our earnings. For the full year , we expect a tax rate of under 23%. Now onto slide 12. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.8% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, 180 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13%. In the quarter , we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchase of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $937 million. Given the uncertainty around the capital rules at this time, we expect to moderate fourth quarter share repurchases versus the third quarter . We remain committed to paying our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and maintaining a competitive yield. In conclusion, our third quarter results reﬂect the ongoing narrowing of our strategic focus and the execution of our priorities, which will help drive our businesses to produce mid-teens returns through the cycle. We are conﬁdent in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.","We operate two core businesses, our market-leading Global Banking & Markets franchise, and our growing Asset & W ealth Management platform, both of which are being positioned to deliver mid-teen returns through the cycle.

But frankly speaking, the rules, as proposed, go way too far and do not account for the vast array of improvements made by the largest banks as a result of Dodd-Frank and other reforms. Not only have banks doubled capital over the last 15 years, have improved the quality of capital, increased liquidity , simpliﬁed businesses that have been subjected to ongoing annual stress tests. Requiring too much capital will have negative consequences. I believe if these rules are implemented, three things will happen. First, the cost of credit will go up for businesses of all sizes from large corporations to small businesses. Second, more activity will move to the unregulated shadow banking sector . Policies that incentivize a transfer of risk outside the regulated banking system could, in fact, increase systemic risk. And third, US competitiveness will go down. Our capital markets are the deepest and the most liquid in the world. They're the engine of our economy as access to capital allows for innovation and growth across the country . Our competitive standing as the leading global economy would be negatively impacted by this proposal. The net result of these proposed rules would be slower economic growth in the US, material improvement in the -- soundness of the banking system. W e, alongside clients and others in the industry , have been engaging heavily with our regulators and government stakeholders, and given this engagement, we expect that there will be ongoing debate and ultimately , changes to the proposed rules. Though regulatory uncertainty and geopolitical risks remain top of mind, I feel very conﬁdent about the state of our client franchise and the long-term opportunities for Goldman Sachs. We are focused on the execution of our strategy to further strengthen our leading Global Banking & Markets franchise and grow our Asset & W ealth Management business. I feel good about the relative performance in our core business, and we remain ﬁrmly committed to delivering for clients and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover ﬁnancial results for the quarter .
 Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on page one of the presentation. In the third quarter , we generated net revenues of $1 1.8 billion and net earnings of $2.1 billion, resulting in a [indiscernible] and a return on equity of 7.1%. As David highlighted, earlier this year , we made the strategic decision to narrow our focus, and we made strong progress across a number of activities. W e provide details on the ﬁnancial impact related to these decisions in the selected items table. In aggregate, these items reduced net earnings by $828 million, EPS by $2.41 and our ROE by 3.1 percentage points. These items include results related to our historical principal investments within Asset & W ealth Management, including the net impact of marks, sell-downs and CIE impairments as well as results relating to GreenSky , which includes the impact of our announced sale and ongoing operating results. Additionally , we highlight modest ongoing losses in connection with our residual markets portfolio and operating the PFM business. Turning to performance by segment, starting on page four . Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $8 billion in the third quarter . Advisory revenues of $831 million were down versus a strong prior year period amid lower completions. Equity underwriting revenues rose year-over-year to $308 million, though industry volumes remained well below medium and longer-term averages. Debt underwriting revenues of $415 million also rose versus the third quarter of 2022. For the year-to- date, we ranked Number One in the league tables across announced and completed M&A  as well as equity underwriting and ranked number two in high-yield debt. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter as we successfully brought transactions to market. Though market conditions are dynamic, client engagement continues to be elevated, and our best-in-class franchise remains well positioned to support the needs of our clients as they access the capital markets. FICC net revenues were $3.4 billion in the quarter , down from a strong performance last year , particularly in currency and commodities and up relative to the second quarter . We produced record FICC ﬁnancing revenues of $730 million grow sequentially on better results within mortgages and structured products. Additionally , we were pleased to win the bids for two pools of Signature Bank's capital call facilities, totaling just over $15 billion in commitments that were held for auction by the FDIC in September . As we spoke about at our Investor Day , alternative asset managers are an attractive client set for us, and the purchase of this portfolio allows us to increase our connectivity with this client base, who we can serve even more holistically with our One Goldman Sachs approach. These activities also enable us to grow durable revenues at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Equities net revenues were $3 billion in the quarter . Equities intermediation revenues of $1.7 billion rose 7% year-over-year on better performance in derivatives, while equities ﬁnancing revenues of $1.2 billion were lower versus a record in quarter . Total ﬁnancing revenues across FICC and Equities were nearly $6 billion for the year-to-date, representing a record performance for these more durable activities. Our ﬁnancing results, combined with the substantial share gains we've made since our ﬁrst Investor Day are the direct result of the successful execution of our stated strategic priorities for this business. W e are raising the ﬂoor in Global Banking & Markets as reﬂected by our year-to-date ROE of 13.4% despite muted activity levels across Investment Banking. Now moving to Asset & W ealth Management on page ﬁve. Revenues of $3.2 billion were lower year-over-year , primarily driven by weaker results in equity investments. Management and other fees increased 7% year-over-year to a record $2.4 billion, largely driven by higher average assets under supervision. Private banking and lending revenues were $687 million, up slightly year-on-year , as higher deposit balances and spreads were of fset by our sale of substantially all of the market loan portfolio. W e remain very focused on driving growth in the more durable revenue streams of management and other fees as well as private banking and lending, both of which generated record revenues for the year-to-date period. Equity investments generated net losses of $212 million, driven by markdowns on investments in commercial real estate. In aggregate, the losses from our historical principal investments as well as the results for Marcus loans negatively impacted our 6% pre-tax margin for the segment by 18 percentage points for the year-to-date. Now moving to page six. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at $2.7 trillion. W e saw $1 1 billion of liquidity inﬂows and $7 billion of long-term net inﬂows, representing our 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inﬂows. Turning to page seven on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $267 billion at the end of the third quarter , driving $542 million of management and other fees for the quarter . Gross third-party fundraising was $15 billion for the quarter and $40 billion for the year-to-date. We were pleased to announce the close of Goldman Sachs V intage Fund IX in the third quarter , our largest private equity secondaries fund and one of the largest in history at approximately $14 billion. Total third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day is now $219 billion, putting us well on pace to hit our $225 billion target ahead of schedule. On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $49 billion, of which roughly $21 billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio. In the third quarter , we reduced this portfolio by over $3 billion, bringing year-to-date reductions to $9 billion. W e are on track to achieve our 2024 year-end target of a historical principal investment portfolio below $15 billion. Next, Platform Solutions, page eight. Revenues were $578 million, including a $123 million revenue reduction related to the GreenSky loan book, which was more than offset by a $637 million associated reserve release as we moved the portfolio to held for sale. On page nine ﬁrm-wide net interest income was $1.5 billion in the third quarter , down sequentially as increased funding cost supported trading activities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $178 billion, ﬂat with the prior quarter . Our provision for credit losses was $7 million, which reﬂected net charge-of fs in our credit card lending portfolio, of fset by the reserve release I mentioned related to GreenSky . Additionally , within our wholesale portfolio, impairments were partially of fset by a reserve reduction that was driven by increased stability in the macroeconomic environment versus the prior quarter . On page 10, we provide additional detail on our CRE exposure similar to last quarter . CRE loans continue to represent a relatively small percentage of our overall lending book at 14%. CRE investments are diversiﬁed across geographies and positions, with no single position representing more than 1% of the total on-balance sheet alternative investments. Across both equity investments and CIEs, we have marked or impaired ofﬁce-related exposures by approximately 50% this year . Now turning to expenses on page 1 1. Total quarterly operating expenses were $9.1 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio, net of provisions, is 34.5%, inclusive of approximately $275 million of year-to-date severance costs. At Investor Day in February , we articulated a goal of $600 million in run rate payroll efﬁciencies to be achieved in 2023 and 2024 and we are currently tracking to surpass that goal. These efﬁciencies allow us to reinvest in our highest performing people, particularly as the market for top talent remains ﬁercely competitive. Quarterly non-compensation expense were $0.9 billion. The year-over-year increase in noncomp expenses was driven by the write-down of $506 million in the intangibles related to GreenSky as well as CIE impairments of $358 million. While onetime expenses have been elevated for the year-to-date, we continue to focus on bringing down noncomp expenses and are making progress on our $400 million run rate efﬁciency goal. Our ef fective tax rate for the ﬁrst nine months of 2023 was 23.3%, high versus the ﬁrst half due to the write-of f of deferred tax assets related to GreenSky and the geographic mix of our earnings. For the full year , we expect a tax rate of under 23%. Now onto slide 12. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.8% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach, 180 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13%. In the quarter , we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchase of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $937 million. Given the uncertainty around the capital rules at this time, we expect to moderate fourth quarter share repurchases versus the third quarter . We remain committed to paying our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and maintaining a competitive yield. In conclusion, our third quarter results reﬂect the ongoing narrowing of our strategic focus and the execution of our priorities, which will help drive our businesses to produce mid-teens returns through the cycle. We are conﬁdent in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.","I've never felt more optimistic about the ﬁrm, and our strategy has never been more clear. We operate two core businesses, our market-leading Global Banking & Markets franchise and our growing Asset & W ealth Management platform. We generated record management and other fees of $2.4 billion and are well on our way of achieving our $10 billion annual target to 2024. W e are also ahead of pace on our $2 billion target, and we posted our 23rd consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inﬁows. I'm encouraged by the prospects of a wider reopening of capital markets. If conditions remain conducive, I expect the continued recovery for both capital markets and strategic activity . As a leader in M&A advisory and equity underwriting, a resurgence in activity would be a tail of Goldman Sachs.","Here is the full text of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein's remarks at the firm's annual meeting of shareholders, which will be broadcast live on the firm's website, www.

2023_Q4," Thank you, operator , and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2023 was a dynamic year . The US economy proved to be more resilient than expected, despite a number of headwinds to growth, including a signiﬁcant tightening of ﬁnancial conditions, regional bank failures, and an escalation of geopolitical tensions. Against this backdrop, this was the year of execution for Goldman Sachs. In addition to narrowing our strategic focus, we further strengthened our core businesses. As we enter 2024, the potential for rate cuts in the  ﬁrst half of this year has renewed optimism for a soft landing. W e are already seeing signs of potential resurgence in strategic activity , which is reﬂected in our backlog. I am starting today's presentation with a strategic update, and Denis will provide comments on the ﬁnancial results. Beginning on page one, we aspire to be the world's most exceptional ﬁnancial institution, united by our shared value client service, partnership, integrity , and excellence. And over the last 155 years, we have created one of the most aspirational brands in ﬁnancial services. Goldman Sachs is a preeminent global investment bank and a leader across asset and wealth management. W e've continued to simplify our strategy , and today is an opportunity to take stock of our progress, as well as highlight avenues for further growth. Strategic objectives on this page underscore our relentless commitment to serve our clients with excellence and to further strengthen our client franchise. As we show on page two, we have two world-class and interconnected franchises that are well-positioned to achieve these strategic objectives. First, Global Banking & Markets, which includes our top rank investment bank with an unparalleled merger franchise and a leading capital markets business. It also includes our number one equities franchise and top three FICC franchise. W e are uniquely positioned to serve our clients across geographies and products. And second, our uniﬁed Asset & W ealth Management business where we are leading global active asset manager with a top ﬁve alternative business and a premier ultra-high net worth wealth management franchise. This is a scaled business with over $2.8 trillion in assets under supervision and where we see signiﬁcant opportunity for further growth. Across these two businesses, our extraordinary talent and unmatched execution are bolstered by our One Goldman Sachs operating ethos. On page three, we lay out our progress across a number of key priorities that we discussed at our most recent Investor Day in February 2023. Global Banking & Markets, we've maintained and strengthened our leadership positions across investment banking. In FICC and equities, we have improved our standing with the top 150 clients. W e generated record total ﬁnancing revenues across these businesses in 2023 and have demonstrated impressive growth over the last four years. In Asset & W ealth Management, we've driven solid investment performance and consistent growth in a more durable revenue base of management, other fees, and private banking and lending revenues. This past year , we reduced our historical principal investments by $13 billion, and also surpassed our ﬁve-year alternatives fundraising target one year ahead of schedule. I will talk more about each of these businesses in a moment. Before I do, I would like to speak about how we've narrowed our strategic focus. We made several important decisions and swiftly executed on them. W e exited the Marcus lending business and sold substantially all of our Marcus loan portfolio. W e sold our Personal Financial Management business. W e announced the sale of GreenSky , which remains on track to close this quarter . We also sold the majority of our GreenSky loan portfolio, which settled in the fourth quarter . We've also reached an agreement with General Motors regarding a process to transition their credit card program to another issuer . We remain committed to supporting the products and servicing customers through the various transition agreements and our consumer activities. I ﬁrmly believe companies should innovate and seek out new opportunities for growth. But it is also important to be nimble and make tough decisions when needed. Our consumer ambitions have produced over $150 billion of deposits, which we expect to grow further from here. These deposits have materially improved the ﬁrm's funding proﬁle. Now we are focusing our growth in other areas where we have a proven right to win. We recognize that scale matters as it allows the ﬁrm to operate more efﬁciently and manage incremental regulatory and other costs, making unit economics more favorable. And we need to be measured and focused in our execution. Our narrowed strategy is now focused on our two core businesses where we have a proven right to win with our leadership position, scale, and exceptional talent. On page four , in Global Banking & Markets, our leading and diversiﬁed franchise has produced average revenues of $32 billion over the last four years across a number of different market environments, demonstrating the diversity and relative durability of this business in aggregate. In the last several years, we made a concerted ef fort to grow our wallet share and ﬁnancing revenues, which have clearly raised the revenue ﬂoor for these businesses. We have also generated attractive returns with an average ROE fully allocated of over 16% over the last four years. Turning to page ﬁve, a key part of enhancing this durability has been executing on our strategic priorities. Our ef forts to materially strengthen the client franchise are evidenced by wallet share gains of roughly 350 basis points since 2019. W e've maintained our league table rankings of number one in announced and completed M&A, number one in equity and equity-related underwriting, number two in high yield debt. In FICC and equities, we're in the top three with 1 17 of our top 150 clients. These competitive positions are a reﬂection of our One Goldman Sachs approach and our clients' conﬁdence in us. In addition, we have signiﬁcantly increased more durable ﬁnancing revenue. FICC and equity ﬁnancing together have grown at a 15% CAGR since 2019 to a new record of nearly $8 billion. Turning to Asset & W ealth Management on page six. W e've continued to make progress on bolstering more durable revenue streams. Management and other fees and private banking and lending revenue together have grown at a CAGR of 12% since 2019. W e've also made swift progress in reducing our historical principal investments and are already approaching our pre-tax margin target on an adjusted basis. Turning to page seven. Our solid investment performance across both traditional and alternative channels has driven inﬂows. Over 75% of our traditional funds performed in the top half of Morningstar funds, while on alternatives, over 90% of our funds were in the top half of Cambridge funds, both over the last ﬁve years. The fourth quarter represents our 24th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inﬂows across our platform. I want to reiterate that we have reached a milestone by raising over $250 billion in alternatives since 2019, surpassing our $225 billion target a year early . This fundraising success has been the result of our continued innovation and developing new strategy , as well as our ongoing focus on investment products where we have deep expertise and longstanding track records. Fundraising has been broad-based across geographies and asset classes with approximately 40% coming from our ultra-high net worth relationships. I'm very proud of this achievement. When we were preparing for our ﬁrst Investor Day four years ago, I remember how big a reach our initial target of $150 billion seemed. We’ve surpassed not only that target, but also our increased target of $225 billion one year ahead of schedule demonstrates the power of our platform and the exceptional depth of talent we have in this business. Putting all this together on page eight, you can see how much we've improved the durability of revenues across the ﬁrm. On this slide, baseline revenues are shown in gray, which represents the sum of the trailing 10-year lows for each of the businesses that are considered more cyclical, namely advisory , underwriting, and intermediation. We believe this is a very conservative measurement because it's unlikely that every one of these businesses would ever hit a low point all at the same time. In fact, in all of the years since we became a public company , it has never happened. In dark blue, you can see the more durable revenues from ﬁnancing, management, and other fees, as well as private banking and lending, which in aggregate have grown at 13% CAGR since 2019. Taken together , these two components make up over 70% of revenues in 2023. On top of that, we consistently generate upside across dif ferent market environments because of our diversiﬁed franchise. The increase in the consistent baseline and more durable revenue streams, coupled with the diversiﬁcation of our scaled franchise and our ability to capture upside, demonstrate the revenue-generating power of our ﬁrm. Narrowing our strategic focus, our leadership team spent a signiﬁcant amount of time in 2023 realigning the ﬁrm's priorities with our strategic vision, our values, and our strengths, which we highlighted on page nine. You've heard us talk about many of these elements before, starting with our strategic objectives. First, to harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence. Second, to run world-class, dif ferentiated, and durable businesses. Third, to invest and operate at scale. As you can see on the page, our execution focus areas for 2024 are aligned with these strategic objectives. Taking one example, investing in our people and culture. Exceptional quality of our people, supported by our unique culture of collaboration and excellence is critical in solving our clients' most consequential problem, and it's imperative that we continue to invest in them. All in these objectives and execution focus areas will result in our desired outcomes, to continue to be a trusted advisor to our clients, to be an employer of choice for our people, and to generate mid-teens returns through the cycle and strong total shareholder return. With everything we achieved in 2023, coupled with our clear and simpliﬁed strategy , we have a much stronger platform for 2024. I feel very conﬁdent about the future of Goldman Sachs, our ability to continue to serve our clients with excellence, and that we will continue to deliver for shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover our ﬁnancial results.
 Thank you, David. Good morning. Let me start on page 10 of the presentation. In 2023, we generated net revenues of $46.3 billion, net earnings of $8.5 billion, and earnings per share of $22.87. As David highlighted, we made signiﬁcant progress this year in narrowing our strategic focus. W e provide details on the ﬁnancial impact related to these decisions, as well as the impact of the FDIC special assessment fees on the slide. In aggregate, these items reduced full year net earnings by $2.8 billion, earnings per share by $8.04, and our ROE by 2.6 percentage points. Turning to performance by business, starting on page 12. Global Banking & Markets generated revenues of $30 billion for the year , down 8% as higher equities revenues were more than of fset by a decline in FICC revenues and investment banking fees versus last year . In the fourth quarter , investment banking fees of $1.7 billion fell 12% year-over-year , driven by a decline in advisory revenues versus a very strong quarter in 2022. For 2023, we maintained our number one league table position in announced and completed M&A  as well as in equity and equity-related underwriting and ranked second in high yield debt underwriting. Our backlog rose quarter-on-quarter , driven by a signiﬁcant increase in advisory . As David mentioned, we are encouraged by the robust level of dialogues with our corporate client base. And though we're only two weeks into the New Year, there have been solid levels of capital markets activity in both the US and Europe. FICC net revenues were $2 billion in the quarter , down 24% from strong performance last year , amid lower activity in rates and other macro products. In FICC ﬁnancing, revenues rose to a record $739 million. Equities net revenues were $2.6 billion in the quarter , up 26% year-on-year . The year-over-year increase in intermediation revenues was driven by better results in derivatives. Financing revenues of $1.1 billion rose year-over-year with continued strength on higher average balances. Across FICC and equities, ﬁnancing revenues rose 10% in 2023, consistent with our priority to grow client ﬁnancing. Moving to Asset & W ealth Management on page 14. For 2023, revenues of $13.9 billion rose 4% year-over-year , as an increase in more durable revenues, including record management and other fees and record private banking and lending revenues, of fset a decline in equity investments revenues and incentive fees. Fourth quarter management and other fees of $2.4 billion were up 9% year-over- year. Full year management and other fees were $9.5 billion, putting us on track to hit our $10 billion target in 2024, notwithstanding the sale of our PFM business. Equity investments produced net revenues of $838 million, higher year-over-year , driven by modest gains in our public portfolio versus losses in the fourth quarter of last year . Results in this line item also included a gain of $349 million from the sale of PFM. Moving on to page 15. Total ﬁrm-wide assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.8 trillion, driven by market appreciation as well as strong net inﬂows across ﬁxed income and alternative assets, and representing our 24th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inﬂows. Turning to page 16 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $295 billion at the end of the fourth quarter , driving $571 million in management and other fees for the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year , surpassing our $2 billion target for 2024. Gross third-party fundraising was $32 billion for the quarter and $72 billion for the year . As David mentioned, third-party fundraising since our 2020 Investor Day now stands at over $250 billion. On-balance sheet alternative investments totaled approximately $46 billion, of which roughly $16 billion is related to our historical principal investment portfolio. In the fourth quarter , we reduced this portfolio by over $4 billion, including sales of $3 billion of CIEs across over 40 positions, bringing reductions for the year to $13 billion. W e continue to focus on exiting this portfolio over the medium-term, though we don't expect portfolio reductions in 2024 to be at the same pace as in 2023. I'll now turn to platform solutions on page 17. Full year revenues were $2.4 billion, up 58% versus 2022. Quarterly net revenues of $577 million were up 12% year-over- year on higher consumer platform results amid growth in average credit card balances. As David mentioned, we reached an agreement with General Motors regarding a process to transition their credit card program to another issuer , the impact of which was to move the loans to held for sale and release the associated loan loss reserves of approximately $160 million. W e have no additional updates regarding our credit card partnerships at this time. On page 18, ﬁrm-wide net interest income of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter was down 13% relative to the third quarter , reﬂecting an increase in funding costs supporting trading activities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $183 billion, modestly higher versus the third quarter , reﬂecting an increase in other collateralized lending, which includes the pools of Signature Bank's capital call facilities we won at auction in October . Our provision for credit losses was $577 million. In relation to our consumer portfolio, provisions were driven by net charge-of fs and seasonal balance growth, partially offset by the GM reserve release I mentioned. For our wholesale portfolio, provisions were driven by impairments that were generally in line with the last two quarters, with roughly half related to CRE. Let's turn to expenses on page 20. Total operating expenses for the year were $34.5 billion, excluding severance-related costs of $310 million, compensation expense was ﬂat year-over-year , amid solid core performance, and as the market for talent remains competitive. As of the fourth quarter , we achieved our goal of $600 million in run rate payroll efﬁciencies, which allowed us to continue investing in our talent. Quarterly non- compensation expenses were $4.9 billion, and included CIE impairments of $262 million. The year-over-year increase in non-comp expenses was driven by the FDIC special assessment fee of $529 million. Our ef fective tax rate for 2023 was 20.7%. For 2024, we expect a tax rate of 22% to 23%. Turning to capital on slide 21. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 14.5% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, 150 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13%. In the fourth quarter , we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1 billion at an average price of $31 1 and common stock dividends of $922 million. While we expect to remain nimble with respect to capital return, given the ongoing uncertainty around the Basel III proposed rule, our capital management philosophy is unchanged. We prioritize supporting client deployment opportunities, sustainably growing our dividend, and returning excess to shareholders in the form of buybacks, particularly when valuation levels are attractive. In conclusion, we made solid progress on narrowing our strategic focus in 2023 with our execution driving a much stronger platform for 2024. Our best-in-class core businesses are well-positioned to execute on our strategic objectives. We will continue to Harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence, run world-class dif ferentiated and durable businesses, and invest to operate our businesses at scale. Additionally , the execution focus areas we've identiﬁed for 2024 will help us drive the outcomes of delivering for clients, our people, and our shareholders. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.","And second, our uniﬁed Asset & W ealth Management business where we are leading global active asset manager with a top ﬁve alternative business and a premier ultra-high net worth wealth management franchise.
W e generated record total ﬁnancing revenues across these businesses in 2023 and have demonstrated impressive growth over the last four years.

As David highlighted, we made signiﬁcant progress this year in narrowing our strategic focus.

We will continue to Harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence, run world-class dif ferentiated and durable businesses, and invest to operate our businesses at scale."," Thank you, operator , and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. 2023 was a dynamic year . The US economy proved to be more resilient than expected, despite a number of headwinds to growth, including a signiﬁcant tightening of ﬁnancial conditions, regional bank failures, and an escalation of geopolitical tensions. Against this backdrop, this was the year of execution for Goldman Sachs. In addition to narrowing our strategic focus, we further strengthened our core businesses. As we enter 2024, the potential for rate cuts in the  ﬁrst half of this year has renewed optimism for a soft landing. W e are already seeing signs of potential resurgence in strategic activity , which is reﬂected in our backlog. I am starting today's presentation with a strategic update, and Denis will provide comments on the ﬁnancial results. Beginning on page one, we aspire to be the world's most exceptional ﬁnancial institution, united by our shared value client service, partnership, integrity , and excellence. And over the last 155 years, we have created one of the most aspirational brands in ﬁnancial services. Goldman Sachs is a preeminent global investment bank and a leader across asset and wealth management. W e've continued to simplify our strategy , and today is an opportunity to take stock of our progress, as well as highlight avenues for further growth. Strategic objectives on this page underscore our relentless commitment to serve our clients with excellence and to further strengthen our client franchise. As we show on page two, we have two world-class and interconnected franchises that are well-positioned to achieve these strategic objectives. First, Global Banking & Markets, which includes our top rank investment bank with an unparalleled merger franchise and a leading capital markets business. It also includes our number one equities franchise and top three FICC franchise. W e are uniquely positioned to serve our clients across geographies and products. And second, our uniﬁed Asset & W ealth Management business where we are leading global active asset manager with a top ﬁve alternative business and a premier ultra-high net worth wealth management franchise. This is a scaled business with over $2.8 trillion in assets under supervision and where we see signiﬁcant opportunity for further growth. Across these two businesses, our extraordinary talent and unmatched execution are bolstered by our One Goldman Sachs operating ethos. On page three, we lay out our progress across a number of key priorities that we discussed at our most recent Investor Day in February 2023. Global Banking & Markets, we've maintained and strengthened our leadership positions across investment banking. In FICC and equities, we have improved our standing with the top 150 clients. W e generated record total ﬁnancing revenues across these businesses in 2023 and have demonstrated impressive growth over the last four years. In Asset & W ealth Management, we've driven solid investment performance and consistent growth in a more durable revenue base of management, other fees, and private banking and lending revenues. This past year , we reduced our historical principal investments by $13 billion, and also surpassed our ﬁve-year alternatives fundraising target one year ahead of schedule. I will talk more about each of these businesses in a moment. Before I do, I would like to speak about how we've narrowed our strategic focus. We made several important decisions and swiftly executed on them. W e exited the Marcus lending business and sold substantially all of our Marcus loan portfolio. W e sold our Personal Financial Management business. W e announced the sale of GreenSky , which remains on track to close this quarter . We also sold the majority of our GreenSky loan portfolio, which settled in the fourth quarter . We've also reached an agreement with General Motors regarding a process to transition their credit card program to another issuer . We remain committed to supporting the products and servicing customers through the various transition agreements and our consumer activities. I ﬁrmly believe companies should innovate and seek out new opportunities for growth. But it is also important to be nimble and make tough decisions when needed. Our consumer ambitions have produced over $150 billion of deposits, which we expect to grow further from here. These deposits have materially improved the ﬁrm's funding proﬁle. Now we are focusing our growth in other areas where we have a proven right to win. We recognize that scale matters as it allows the ﬁrm to operate more efﬁciently and manage incremental regulatory and other costs, making unit economics more favorable. And we need to be measured and focused in our execution. Our narrowed strategy is now focused on our two core businesses where we have a proven right to win with our leadership position, scale, and exceptional talent. On page four , in Global Banking & Markets, our leading and diversiﬁed franchise has produced average revenues of $32 billion over the last four years across a number of different market environments, demonstrating the diversity and relative durability of this business in aggregate. In the last several years, we made a concerted ef fort to grow our wallet share and ﬁnancing revenues, which have clearly raised the revenue ﬂoor for these businesses. We have also generated attractive returns with an average ROE fully allocated of over 16% over the last four years. Turning to page ﬁve, a key part of enhancing this durability has been executing on our strategic priorities. Our ef forts to materially strengthen the client franchise are evidenced by wallet share gains of roughly 350 basis points since 2019. W e've maintained our league table rankings of number one in announced and completed M&A, number one in equity and equity-related underwriting, number two in high yield debt. In FICC and equities, we're in the top three with 1 17 of our top 150 clients. These competitive positions are a reﬂection of our One Goldman Sachs approach and our clients' conﬁdence in us. In addition, we have signiﬁcantly increased more durable ﬁnancing revenue. FICC and equity ﬁnancing together have grown at a 15% CAGR since 2019 to a new record of nearly $8 billion. Turning to Asset & W ealth Management on page six. W e've continued to make progress on bolstering more durable revenue streams. Management and other fees and private banking and lending revenue together have grown at a CAGR of 12% since 2019. W e've also made swift progress in reducing our historical principal investments and are already approaching our pre-tax margin target on an adjusted basis. Turning to page seven. Our solid investment performance across both traditional and alternative channels has driven inﬂows. Over 75% of our traditional funds performed in the top half of Morningstar funds, while on alternatives, over 90% of our funds were in the top half of Cambridge funds, both over the last ﬁve years. The fourth quarter represents our 24th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inﬂows across our platform. I want to reiterate that we have reached a milestone by raising over $250 billion in alternatives since 2019, surpassing our $225 billion target a year early . This fundraising success has been the result of our continued innovation and developing new strategy , as well as our ongoing focus on investment products where we have deep expertise and longstanding track records. Fundraising has been broad-based across geographies and asset classes with approximately 40% coming from our ultra-high net worth relationships. I'm very proud of this achievement. When we were preparing for our ﬁrst Investor Day four years ago, I remember how big a reach our initial target of $150 billion seemed. We’ve surpassed not only that target, but also our increased target of $225 billion one year ahead of schedule demonstrates the power of our platform and the exceptional depth of talent we have in this business. Putting all this together on page eight, you can see how much we've improved the durability of revenues across the ﬁrm. On this slide, baseline revenues are shown in gray, which represents the sum of the trailing 10-year lows for each of the businesses that are considered more cyclical, namely advisory , underwriting, and intermediation. We believe this is a very conservative measurement because it's unlikely that every one of these businesses would ever hit a low point all at the same time. In fact, in all of the years since we became a public company , it has never happened. In dark blue, you can see the more durable revenues from ﬁnancing, management, and other fees, as well as private banking and lending, which in aggregate have grown at 13% CAGR since 2019. Taken together , these two components make up over 70% of revenues in 2023. On top of that, we consistently generate upside across dif ferent market environments because of our diversiﬁed franchise. The increase in the consistent baseline and more durable revenue streams, coupled with the diversiﬁcation of our scaled franchise and our ability to capture upside, demonstrate the revenue-generating power of our ﬁrm. Narrowing our strategic focus, our leadership team spent a signiﬁcant amount of time in 2023 realigning the ﬁrm's priorities with our strategic vision, our values, and our strengths, which we highlighted on page nine. You've heard us talk about many of these elements before, starting with our strategic objectives. First, to harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence. Second, to run world-class, dif ferentiated, and durable businesses. Third, to invest and operate at scale. As you can see on the page, our execution focus areas for 2024 are aligned with these strategic objectives. Taking one example, investing in our people and culture. Exceptional quality of our people, supported by our unique culture of collaboration and excellence is critical in solving our clients' most consequential problem, and it's imperative that we continue to invest in them. All in these objectives and execution focus areas will result in our desired outcomes, to continue to be a trusted advisor to our clients, to be an employer of choice for our people, and to generate mid-teens returns through the cycle and strong total shareholder return. With everything we achieved in 2023, coupled with our clear and simpliﬁed strategy , we have a much stronger platform for 2024. I feel very conﬁdent about the future of Goldman Sachs, our ability to continue to serve our clients with excellence, and that we will continue to deliver for shareholders. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover our ﬁnancial results.
 Thank you, David. Good morning. Let me start on page 10 of the presentation. In 2023, we generated net revenues of $46.3 billion, net earnings of $8.5 billion, and earnings per share of $22.87. As David highlighted, we made signiﬁcant progress this year in narrowing our strategic focus. W e provide details on the ﬁnancial impact related to these decisions, as well as the impact of the FDIC special assessment fees on the slide. In aggregate, these items reduced full year net earnings by $2.8 billion, earnings per share by $8.04, and our ROE by 2.6 percentage points. Turning to performance by business, starting on page 12. Global Banking & Markets generated revenues of $30 billion for the year , down 8% as higher equities revenues were more than of fset by a decline in FICC revenues and investment banking fees versus last year . In the fourth quarter , investment banking fees of $1.7 billion fell 12% year-over-year , driven by a decline in advisory revenues versus a very strong quarter in 2022. For 2023, we maintained our number one league table position in announced and completed M&A  as well as in equity and equity-related underwriting and ranked second in high yield debt underwriting.

2024_Q1," Thank you, operator , and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. W e feel very good about our ﬁrst quarter results, which reﬂect the strength of our world- class and interconnected franchises and the earnings power of our ﬁrm. This performance was aided by the swift actions we took last year to narrow our strategic focus and play to our core strengths. As you can see, we are delivering on our strategy and we are pleased with the returns we generated this quarter . As laid out in January , we have three strategic objectives: to harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence; to run world-class dif ferentiated and durable businesses; and to invest to operate at-scale. Across the ﬁrm, we are effectively serving clients in what remains a complex operating environment. Looking back on the last year or so, one of the most common questions clients and investors have asked is around the timing of a broader reopening of the capital markets. I've said before that the historically depressed levels of activity wouldn't last forever . CEOs need to make strategic decisions for their ﬁrms, companies of all sizes need to raise capital, and ﬁnancial sponsors need to transact to generate returns for their investors. Where we stand today , it's clear that we're in the early stages of a reopening of the capital markets, with the ﬁrst few months of 2024 seen an reinvigoration in new issue market access. For example, there were a number of large IPOs across geographies and the strong reception across transactions, including the IPOs for Galderma, Reddit, and Rank is the latest sign that investors' risk appetite is growing. In debt capital markets, tighter spreads have contributed to a constructive issuance environment and investment grades with volumes hitting a record for the ﬁrst three months of the year . Additionally , reﬁnancing was a major theme with robust high-yield and institutional loan reﬁnancing volumes. Given a more accommodative issuance backdrop as well as the potential for increased acquisition ﬁnancing, alongside higher M&A  activity , we expect solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year . With our long-standing leadership positions across the global capital markets, we have been at the forefront in helping our clients access the markets and our ﬁrm stands to beneﬁt further as transaction volumes rise from the 10-year lows. It's important to note that alongside the reopening, we are seeing in capital markets, our intermediation businesses continue to be active in supporting our clients' needs. And we're growing ﬁnancing revenues across FICC and Equities, which together were a record this quarter and rose 18% sequentially . All-in, our top-tier intermediation franchise and more durable ﬁnancing results are helping raise the ﬂoor in global banking and markets. In Asset & W ealth Management, assets under supervision rose to a new record of $2.8 trillion this quarter , which represented our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inﬂows. W e have a diversiﬁed platform across public and private markets and are delivering solid performance across asset classes, and we continue to invest resources in growing this business, particularly across W ealth Management, Alternatives, and Solutions. In Wealth Management, we saw signiﬁcant strength this quarter with total client assets ending at $1.5 trillion. In Alternatives, we raised $14 billion in commitments despite a more difﬁcult fundraising environment. And in Solutions, we continued -- we saw continued demand for our outsourced CIO and SMA  offerings. These are all areas in which we still see signiﬁcant opportunities and we have a proven track record and demonstrated right to win. I also want to touch on a topic coming up in virtually every client conversation I have, Artiﬁcial Intelligence. While there is broad consensus about the transforming potential of AI, there is an enormous appetite for perspectives on how certain aspects may play out, including the timeline for commercial impact, shape of potential regulations, impact on jobs, and where value will accrue in the ecosystem. Today , we are proud to be at the forefront of advising clients on these topics and how to think about potential use cases in their operations. As we look longer-term, to the extent that this technology develops in line with expectations, there will be signiﬁcant demand for AI-related infrastructure and as a result, ﬁnancing, which will be a tailwind to our business. For our own operations, we have a leading team of engineers dedicated to exploring and applying machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence applications. W e are focused on enhancing productivity , particularly for our developers, and increasing operating efﬁciency while maintaining a high bar for quality , security , and controls. Like with any emerging technology , a thoughtful approach and keen eye on risk management will be crucial. Turning to the macro-environment, we continue to be constructive on the health of the U.S. economy . The Fed most recently telegraphed three rate cuts in 2024, but last week's CPI print has lowered market expectations. This will continue to evolve and be highly data-dependent. I am also mindful that U.S. equity markets are hovering near-record levels at a time when we see -- when we continue to see headwinds, including concerns around inﬂation, the commercial real estate market, and escalating geopolitical tensions around the world. This combination could slow growth. But that said, the U.S. economy has proven to be resilient, supported by a number of factors, including government spending as well as labor force growth driven by above-trend levels of immigration. So, while the environment is constructive and markets expect a soft landing, the trajectory is still uncertain. Nonetheless, I'm very conﬁdent about the state of our client franchise, the caliber of our people, and our culture of collaboration and excellence. Every day as I interact with the people of Goldman Sachs around the world, I am consistently impressed by their talent, capabilities, and how tirelessly they work to serve our clients. The quality of our people reinforces my conviction in the long-term opportunity set for Goldman Sachs and our ability to deliver for clients and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Dennis to cover our ﬁnancial results for the quarter .
 Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the ﬁrst quarter , we generated net revenues of $14.2 billion and net earnings of $4.1 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $1 1.58, an ROE of 14.8%, and an ROTE of 15.9%. W e provide details on the ﬁnancial impact of selected items in the bottom table, the aggregate of which was immaterial this quarter . Let's turn to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $9.7 billion in the ﬁrst quarter and generated an 18% ROE on a fully allocated basis. Turning to Page 4. Advisory revenues of $1 billion were up versus a year ago amid higher completed transactions. W e remain number one in the league tables for both announced and completed M&A. Equity underwriting revenues of $370 million and debt underwriting revenues of $699 million, both rose signiﬁcantly year-over-year amid an increase in industry volumes. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter as we successfully brought transactions to market, though client engagement and dialogues remain robust. FICC net revenues were $4.3 billion in the quarter , up from a strong performance last year as our global scaled franchise continued to serve clients amid a dynamic operating environment. Intermediation results were driven by better performance in mortgages, credit, and currencies. Our long history of risk-taking acumen enabled us to ef fectively make markets across a number of dif ferent geographies and asset classes. W e produced record FICC ﬁnancing revenues of $852 million, which rose sequentially primarily on better results in repo. W e remain conﬁdent in our ability to continue to grow balances and drive growth in this business over time. Equities net revenues were $3.3 billion in the quarter . Equities intermediation revenues of $2 billion rose 14% year-over-year on better performance in derivatives. Equities ﬁnancing revenues of $1.3 billion were modestly higher year-over-year as record average prime balances during the quarter were only partially of fset by lower ﬁnancing spreads. Moving to Asset & W ealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.8 billion were 18% higher year-over-year . Record management and other fees were up 7% year- over-year to $2.5 billion. As a reminder , we closed the sale of Personal Financial Management in November of last year , which contributed approximately $60 million in fees in the year-ago period. Incentive fees for the quarter were $88 million, up sequentially and year-over-year . Based on our bottoms-up analysis, we expect to reach our target of $1 billion in annual incentive fees over the medium term, supported by an estimated $3.8 billion of unrecognized incentive fees as of year-end. Private banking and lending revenues were $682 million, up substantially as revenues in the prior year period were negatively impacted by the partial sale of our Marcus loan portfolio. Equity investments and debt investments revenues totaled $567 million. In equity investments, we saw improved performance year-over-year in our private portfolio that was largely of fset by a markdown on a large public position. Now moving to Page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.8 trillion. W e had $24 billion of long-term net inﬂows, largely in ﬁxed income, representing our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inﬂows. Turning to Page 7, on Alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $296 billion at the end of the ﬁrst quarter , driving $486 million in management and other fees. Gross third-party fundraising was $14 billion in the quarter . We continue to expect to raise between $40 billion and $50 billion in Alternatives across private equity and other strategies this year . More broadly , we are leveraging our long-standing leadership position in private credit to capitalize on this secular growth opportunity and expect to grow our assets from roughly $130 billion to $300 billion over the next ﬁve years. On-balance sheet Alternative investments totaled approximately $44 billion. In the ﬁrst quarter , we reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $1.5 billion to $14.8 billion. W e expect reductions at roughly this pace for the rest of 2024 and expect to sell down the vast majority of our HPI portfolio by the end of 2026 consistent with our target. Next, Platform Solutions on Page 8. Revenues were $698 million. Overall, segment proﬁtability has improved with a pre-tax net loss of $1 17 million for the quarter . In line with our target, we expect to drive this business to pre-tax breakeven next year . On Page 9, ﬁrmwide net interest income was $1.6 billion in the ﬁrst quarter , up sequentially on an increase in interest-earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $184 billion, roughly in line with the fourth quarter , as an increase in other collateralized lending was partially of fset by the sale of the remaining GreenSky portfolio. Our provision for credit losses was $318 million, which reﬂected net charge-of fs in our credit card lending portfolio. Within our wholesale portfolio, impairments trended modestly lower versus the levels in the last few quarters. Turning to Page 10. W e continue to provide additional information detailing our CRE exposure. As you know , we moved early in actively risk managing our CRE exposure and currently have $26 billion in loans, $4 billion in AWM alternative equity and debt securities, and $2 billion in equity at-risk related to CIEs. Turning to expenses on Page 1 1. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.7 billion, resulting in an efﬁciency ratio of 60.9%. Our compensation ratio net of provisions was 33%, reﬂecting improved operating performance for the ﬁrm. Non-compensation expenses were $4.1 billion. These costs declined year-on-year , even inclusive of a $78 million FDIC special assessment charge, and were down sharply versus the fourth quarter . Our ef fective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1% and for the full year , we expect a tax rate of approximately 22%. Now on to Slide 12. Our Common Equity Tier-1 ratio was 14.7% at the end of the ﬁrst quarter under the standardized approach. In the quarter , we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $929 million. We are currently running with a 170 basis point buf fer above our capital requirements. Given expectations for signiﬁcant modiﬁcations to the Basel III proposed rule, we should have materially more ﬂexibility on capital deployment. W e also remain committed to paying our shareholders a sustainable and growing dividend. In conclusion, our ﬁrst quarter results reﬂect the strength of our leading global banking and markets franchise and our growing Asset & W ealth Management business. Simply put, we are delivering on the things we said we would do. We are focused on our strategic objectives and the execution focus areas for 2024 that we laid out in January , which will help our businesses produce mid-teens returns through the cycle. W e are conﬁdent in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.","W e feel very good about our ﬁrst quarter results, which reﬂect the strength of our world- class and interconnected franchises and the earnings power of our ﬁrm.
And we're growing ﬁnancing revenues across FICC and Equities, which together were a record this quarter and rose 18% sequentially .
In Asset & W ealth Management, assets under supervision rose to a new record of $2.8 trillion this quarter , which represented our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inﬂows.
W e have a diversiﬁed platform across public and private markets and are delivering solid performance across asset classes, and we continue to invest resources in growing this business, particularly across W ealth Management, Alternatives, and Solutions.
In Wealth Management, we saw signiﬁcant strength this quarter with total client assets ending at $1.5 trillion.
In the ﬁrst quarter , we generated net revenues of $14.2 billion and net earnings of $4.1 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $1 1.58, an ROE of 14.8%, and an ROTE of 15.9%.
Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $9.7 billion in the ﬁrst quarter and generated an 18% ROE on a fully allocated basis.
FICC net revenues were $4.3 billion in the quarter , up from a strong performance last year as our global scaled franchise continued to serve clients amid a dynamic operating environment.

Equities net revenues were $3.3 billion in the quarter .
Equities intermediation revenues of $2 billion rose 14% year-over-year on better performance in derivatives.
Equities ﬁnancing revenues of $1.3 billion were modestly higher year-over-year as record average prime balances during the quarter were only partially of fset by lower ﬁnancing spreads.

We continue to expect to raise between $40 billion and $50 billion in Alternatives across private equity and other strategies this year .
More broadly , we are leveraging our long-standing leadership position in private credit to capitalize on this secular growth opportunity and expect to grow our assets from roughly $130 billion to $300 billion over the next ﬁve years.
On Page 9, ﬁrmwide net interest income was $1.6 billion in the ﬁrst quarter , up sequentially on an increase in interest-earning assets.
Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $184 billion, roughly in line with the fourth quarter , as an increase in other collateralized lending was partially of fset by the sale of the remaining GreenSky portfolio.
As you know , we moved early in actively risk managing our CRE exposure and currently have $26 billion in loans, $4 billion in AWM alternative equity and debt securities, and $2 billion in equity at-risk related to CIEs. Turning to expenses on Page 1 1.
Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.7 billion, resulting in an efﬁciency ratio of 60.9%.
In conclusion, our ﬁrst quarter results reﬂect the strength of our leading global banking and markets franchise and our growing Asset & W ealth Management business.
W e are conﬁdent in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs."," Thank you, operator , and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. W e feel very good about our ﬁrst quarter results, which reﬂect the strength of our world- class and interconnected franchises and the earnings power of our ﬁrm. This performance was aided by the swift actions we took last year to narrow our strategic focus and play to our core strengths. As you can see, we are delivering on our strategy and we are pleased with the returns we generated this quarter . As laid out in January , we have three strategic objectives: to harness One Goldman Sachs to serve our clients with excellence; to run world-class dif ferentiated and durable businesses; and to invest to operate at-scale. Across the ﬁrm, we are effectively serving clients in what remains a complex operating environment. Looking back on the last year or so, one of the most common questions clients and investors have asked is around the timing of a broader reopening of the capital markets. I've said before that the historically depressed levels of activity wouldn't last forever . CEOs need to make strategic decisions for their ﬁrms, companies of all sizes need to raise capital, and ﬁnancial sponsors need to transact to generate returns for their investors. Where we stand today , it's clear that we're in the early stages of a reopening of the capital markets, with the ﬁrst few months of 2024 seen an reinvigoration in new issue market access. For example, there were a number of large IPOs across geographies and the strong reception across transactions, including the IPOs for Galderma, Reddit, and Rank is the latest sign that investors' risk appetite is growing. In debt capital markets, tighter spreads have contributed to a constructive issuance environment and investment grades with volumes hitting a record for the ﬁrst three months of the year . Additionally , reﬁnancing was a major theme with robust high-yield and institutional loan reﬁnancing volumes. Given a more accommodative issuance backdrop as well as the potential for increased acquisition ﬁnancing, alongside higher M&A  activity , we expect solid levels of debt underwriting activity to continue this year . With our long-standing leadership positions across the global capital markets, we have been at the forefront in helping our clients access the markets and our ﬁrm stands to beneﬁt further as transaction volumes rise from the 10-year lows. It's important to note that alongside the reopening, we are seeing in capital markets, our intermediation businesses continue to be active in supporting our clients' needs. And we're growing ﬁnancing revenues across FICC and Equities, which together were a record this quarter and rose 18% sequentially . All-in, our top-tier intermediation franchise and more durable ﬁnancing results are helping raise the ﬂoor in global banking and markets. In Asset & W ealth Management, assets under supervision rose to a new record of $2.8 trillion this quarter , which represented our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inﬂows. W e have a diversiﬁed platform across public and private markets and are delivering solid performance across asset classes, and we continue to invest resources in growing this business, particularly across W ealth Management, Alternatives, and Solutions. In Wealth Management, we saw signiﬁcant strength this quarter with total client assets ending at $1.5 trillion. In Alternatives, we raised $14 billion in commitments despite a more difﬁcult fundraising environment. And in Solutions, we continued -- we saw continued demand for our outsourced CIO and SMA  offerings. These are all areas in which we still see signiﬁcant opportunities and we have a proven track record and demonstrated right to win. I also want to touch on a topic coming up in virtually every client conversation I have, Artiﬁcial Intelligence. While there is broad consensus about the transforming potential of AI, there is an enormous appetite for perspectives on how certain aspects may play out, including the timeline for commercial impact, shape of potential regulations, impact on jobs, and where value will accrue in the ecosystem. Today , we are proud to be at the forefront of advising clients on these topics and how to think about potential use cases in their operations. As we look longer-term, to the extent that this technology develops in line with expectations, there will be signiﬁcant demand for AI-related infrastructure and as a result, ﬁnancing, which will be a tailwind to our business. For our own operations, we have a leading team of engineers dedicated to exploring and applying machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence applications. W e are focused on enhancing productivity , particularly for our developers, and increasing operating efﬁciency while maintaining a high bar for quality , security , and controls. Like with any emerging technology , a thoughtful approach and keen eye on risk management will be crucial. Turning to the macro-environment, we continue to be constructive on the health of the U.S. economy . The Fed most recently telegraphed three rate cuts in 2024, but last week's CPI print has lowered market expectations. This will continue to evolve and be highly data-dependent. I am also mindful that U.S. equity markets are hovering near-record levels at a time when we see -- when we continue to see headwinds, including concerns around inﬂation, the commercial real estate market, and escalating geopolitical tensions around the world. This combination could slow growth. But that said, the U.S. economy has proven to be resilient, supported by a number of factors, including government spending as well as labor force growth driven by above-trend levels of immigration. So, while the environment is constructive and markets expect a soft landing, the trajectory is still uncertain. Nonetheless, I'm very conﬁdent about the state of our client franchise, the caliber of our people, and our culture of collaboration and excellence. Every day as I interact with the people of Goldman Sachs around the world, I am consistently impressed by their talent, capabilities, and how tirelessly they work to serve our clients. The quality of our people reinforces my conviction in the long-term opportunity set for Goldman Sachs and our ability to deliver for clients and shareholders. I will now turn it over to Dennis to cover our ﬁnancial results for the quarter .
 Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the ﬁrst quarter , we generated net revenues of $14.2 billion and net earnings of $4.1 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $1 1.58, an ROE of 14.8%, and an ROTE of 15.9%. W e provide details on the ﬁnancial impact of selected items in the bottom table, the aggregate of which was immaterial this quarter . Let's turn to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $9.7 billion in the ﬁrst quarter and generated an 18% ROE on a fully allocated basis. Turning to Page 4. Advisory revenues of $1 billion were up versus a year ago amid higher completed transactions. W e remain number one in the league tables for both announced and completed M&A. Equity underwriting revenues of $370 million and debt underwriting revenues of $699 million, both rose signiﬁcantly year-over-year amid an increase in industry volumes. Our backlog fell quarter-on-quarter as we successfully brought transactions to market, though client engagement and dialogues remain robust. FICC net revenues were $4.3 billion in the quarter , up from a strong performance last year as our global scaled franchise continued to serve clients amid a dynamic operating environment. Intermediation results were driven by better performance in mortgages, credit, and currencies. Our long history of risk-taking acumen enabled us to ef fectively make markets across a number of dif ferent geographies and asset classes. W e produced record FICC ﬁnancing revenues of $852 million, which rose sequentially primarily on better results in repo. W e remain conﬁdent in our ability to continue to grow balances and drive growth in this business over time. Equities net revenues were $3.3 billion in the quarter . Equities intermediation revenues of $2 billion rose 14% year-over-year on better performance in derivatives. Equities ﬁnancing revenues of $1.3 billion were modestly higher year-over-year as record average prime balances during the quarter were only partially of fset by lower ﬁnancing spreads. Moving to Asset & W ealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.8 billion were 18% higher year-over-year . Record management and other fees were up 7% year- over-year to $2.5 billion. As a reminder , we closed the sale of Personal Financial Management in November of last year , which contributed approximately $60 million in fees in the year-ago period. Incentive fees for the quarter were $88 million, up sequentially and year-over-year . Based on our bottoms-up analysis, we expect to reach our target of $1 billion in annual incentive fees over the medium term, supported by an estimated $3.8 billion of unrecognized incentive fees as of year-end. Private banking and lending revenues were $682 million, up substantially as revenues in the prior year period were negatively impacted by the partial sale of our Marcus loan portfolio. Equity investments and debt investments revenues totaled $567 million. In equity investments, we saw improved performance year-over-year in our private portfolio that was largely of fset by a markdown on a large public position. Now moving to Page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $2.8 trillion. W e had $24 billion of long-term net inﬂows, largely in ﬁxed income, representing our 25th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based inﬂows. Turning to Page 7, on Alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $296 billion at the end of the ﬁrst quarter , driving $486 million in management and other fees. Gross third-party fundraising was $14 billion in the quarter . We continue to expect to raise between $40 billion and $50 billion in Alternatives across private equity and other strategies this year . More broadly , we are leveraging our long-standing leadership position in private credit to capitalize on this secular growth opportunity and expect to grow our assets from roughly $130 billion to $300 billion over the next ﬁve years. On-balance sheet Alternative investments totaled approximately $44 billion. In the ﬁrst quarter , we reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $1.5 billion to $14.8 billion. W e expect reductions at roughly this pace for the rest of 2024 and expect to sell down the vast majority of our HPI portfolio by the end of 2026 consistent with our target. Next, Platform Solutions on Page 8. Revenues were $698 million. Overall, segment proﬁtability has improved with a pre-tax net loss of $1 17 million for the quarter . In line with our target, we expect to drive this business to pre-tax breakeven next year . On Page 9, ﬁrmwide net interest income was $1.6 billion in the ﬁrst quarter , up sequentially on an increase in interest-earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $184 billion, roughly in line with the fourth quarter , as an increase in other collateralized lending was partially of fset by the sale of the remaining GreenSky portfolio. Our provision for credit losses was $318 million, which reﬂected net charge-of fs in our credit card lending portfolio. Within our wholesale portfolio, impairments trended modestly lower versus the levels in the last few quarters. Turning to Page 10. W e continue to provide additional information detailing our CRE exposure. As you know , we moved early in actively risk managing our CRE exposure and currently have $26 billion in loans, $4 billion in AWM alternative equity and debt securities, and $2 billion in equity at-risk related to CIEs. Turning to expenses on Page 1 1. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.7 billion, resulting in an efﬁciency ratio of 60.9%. Our compensation ratio net of provisions was 33%, reﬂecting improved operating performance for the ﬁrm. Non-compensation expenses were $4.1 billion. These costs declined year-on-year , even inclusive of a $78 million FDIC special assessment charge, and were down sharply versus the fourth quarter . Our ef fective tax rate for the quarter was 21.1% and for the full year , we expect a tax rate of approximately 22%. Now on to Slide 12. Our Common Equity Tier-1 ratio was 14.7% at the end of the ﬁrst quarter under the standardized approach. In the quarter , we returned $2.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $1.5 billion and common stock dividends of $929 million. We are currently running with a 170 basis point buf fer above our capital requirements. Given expectations for signiﬁcant modiﬁcations to the Basel III proposed rule, we should have materially more ﬂexibility on capital deployment. W e also remain committed to paying our shareholders a sustainable and growing dividend. In conclusion, our ﬁrst quarter results reﬂect the strength of our leading global banking and markets franchise and our growing Asset & W ealth Management business. Simply put, we are delivering on the things we said we would do. We are focused on our strategic objectives and the execution focus areas for 2024 that we laid out in January , which will help our businesses produce mid-teens returns through the cycle. W e are conﬁdent in our ability to deliver for shareholders while continuing to support our clients and remain optimistic about the future opportunity set for Goldman Sachs. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.","Goldman Sachs announced its first quarter results on Tuesday.

2024_Q2," Thank you, operator , and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. I want to begin by addressing the horrible act of violence that occurred over the weekend, the attempted assassination of former President Trump. W e are grateful that he is safe. I also want to extend my sincere condolences to the families of those who were tragically killed and severely injured. It is a sad moment for our country . There is no place in our politics for violence. I urge people to come  together and to treat one another with respect, civility , dignity , especially when we disagree. W e cannot af ford division and distrust to get the better of us. I truly hope this is a moment that will spur reﬂection and action that celebrate, that celebrate what unites us as citizens and as a society . Turning to our performance. Our second quarter results were solid. W e delivered strong year-on-year growth in both global banking and markets and asset wealth management. I am pleased with our performance where we produced a 10.9% ROE for the second quarter and a 12.8% ROE for the ﬁrst-half of the year . We continue to harness our One Goldman Sachs operating approach to execute on our strategy and serve our clients in dynamic environments. Global banking and markets, we maintained our long-standing #1 rank in announcement completed M&A  and ranked #2 in equity underwriting. Our investment banking backlog is up signiﬁcantly this quarter . From what we're seeing, we are in the early innings of the capital markets and M&A  recovery . And while certain transaction volumes are still well below their 10-year averages, we remain very well positioned to beneﬁt from a continued resurgence in activity . We saw a solid year-over-year revenue growth across both FIC and equities as our global broad and deep franchise remained active in supporting clients' risk intermediation and ﬁnancing needs. W e continue to be focused on maximizing our wallet share and we have improved our standing to be in the top three with 1 18 of our top 150 clients. In asset wealth management, we are growing more durable management and other fees in private, banking, and lending revenues, which together were a record $3.2 billion for this quarter . Our Assets Under Supervision had a record of $2.9 trillion and total wealth management client assets rose to roughly $1.5 trillion. W e delivered a 23% margin for the ﬁrst-half of the year and are making progress on improving the return proﬁle of AWM. In alternatives, we raised $36 billion a year-to-date. W e completed a number of notable fund closings during the quarter , including $20 billion of total capital for private credit strategies, and approximately $10 billion across real estate investing strategies. Given the stronger-than-anticipated fundraising in the ﬁrst-half of the year , as well as our current pipeline, we expect to exceed $50 billion in alternatives fundraising this year . This is a testament to our investment performance, track record, and intense focus on client experience. W e are excited about the additional growth opportunities for our asset growth management platform. Let me turn to the operating environment, which remains top of mind for clients. On the one hand, there is a high level of geopolitical instability , elections across the globe could have signiﬁcant implications for forward policy , and inﬂation is proven to be stickier than many had anticipated. On the other hand the environment in the U.S. remains relatively constructive. Markets continue to forecast a soft landing as the expected economic growth trajectory improves and equity markets remain near all- time highs. I am particularly encouraged by the ongoing advancements in artiﬁcial intelligence. Recently , our Board of Directors spent a week in Silicon V alley where we spoke with the CEOs of many of the leading institutions at the cutting-edge of technology and AI. We all left with a sense of optimism about the application of AI tools and the accelerating innovation in technology more broadly . The proliferation of AI in the corporate world will bring with it signiﬁcant demand-related infrastructure and ﬁnancing needs, which should fuel activity across our broad franchise. Before I turn it over to Dennis, I want to cover a couple of additional topics that are top of mind for me. First, our recent stress test results. The year-over-year increase in our stress capital buf fer does not seem to reﬂect the strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress we've made to reduce our stress loss intensity , which the Federal Reserve had recognized in our last three tests. Given this discrepancy , we are engaging with our regulators to better understand its determinations. Despite the increase in requirements, we remain very well positioned to serve our clients and will continue to be nimble with our capital. In the second quarter , we repurchased $3.5 billion of shares, which illustrates our ability to dynamically manage our resources and opportunistically return capital to the shareholders. Despite the increase in our repurchase activity , our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 14.8% under the standardized approach, 90 basis points above our new regulatory minimum and above our ratio in the ﬁrst quarter . We also announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend which underscores our conﬁdence in the durability of our franchise. Since the beginning of 2019, we have more than tripled our quarterly dividend to its current level of $3 a share. I'd also like to reﬂect on the signiﬁcant milestone we hit in the second quarter , our 25th anniversary as a public company . We went public in 1999, which is also the year I joined the ﬁrm, and it's been an eventful 25-years since then. W e have persevered through a number of signiﬁcant global events, including through the dotcom bubble, NASDAQ crash, September 1 1th, the ﬁnancial crisis, and the pandemic. When I look back at how we overcame these challenges, immediately think of our culture, one that has evolved, no doubt, but always stayed true to our core values. I know that the preservation of our culture is paramount to serving our clients with excellence, maintaining our leading market positions, growing our businesses, and continuing to attract and retain the most talented people. In closing, I'm very conﬁdent about the state of our client franchise. W e are delivering on our strategy by leaning into our core strengths ef fectively serving clients in what remains a complicated operating environment. Now let me turn it over to Dennis to cover our ﬁnancial results in more detail.
 Thank you, David, and good morning. Let's start with our results on page one of the presentation. In the second quarter , we generated net revenues of $12.7 billion and net earnings of $3 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $8.62, an ROE of 10.9%, and an ROTE of 1 1.6%. Now turning to performance by segment starting on page four . Global banking and markets produced revenues of $8.2 billion in the second quarter , up 14% versus last year. Advisory revenues of $688 million were up 7% versus the prior year period. Equity underwriting revenues rose 25% year-over-year to $423 million as equity capital markets have continued to reopen. No volumes remain well below longer term averages. Debt underwriting revenues rose 39% to $622 million amid strong leverage ﬁnance activity . We are seeing a material increase in client demand for committed acquisition ﬁnancing, which we expect to continue on the back of increasing M&A  activity .

As David mentioned, our more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues reached a new record this quarter of $3.2 billion. Management and other fees increased 3% sequentially to a record $2.5 billion, largely driven by higher average assets under supervision. Private banking and lending revenues rose 4% sequentially to $707million. Our premier ultra-high net worth wealth management franchise has roughly $1.5 trillion in client assets. This business has been a key contributor to our success in increasing more durable revenues and provides us with a strong source of demand for our suite of alternative products. A great example of the power of this unique platform. W e expect continued momentum in this business as we also deepen our lending penetration with clients and grow our advisor footprint. Our pre-tax margin for the ﬁrst-half was 23%, demonstrating substantial improvement versus last year and approaching our mid-20s medium term target. Now moving to page six.

Rose third-party fundraising was $22 billion for the quarter and $36 billion for the ﬁrst-half of the year . In the second quarter , we further reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $2.2 billion to $12.6 billion. On page nine, ﬁrmwide net interest income was $2.2 billion in the quarter , up sequentially from an increase in higher yielding assets and a shift towards non- interest bearing liabilities. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $184 billion, ﬂat versus the prior quarter . For the second quarter , our provision for credit losses was $282 million, primarily driven by net charge-of fs in our credit card portfolio and partially of fset by a release of roughly $1 15 million related to our wholesale portfolio. Turning to expenses on page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.5 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio net of provisions is 33.5%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.3 billion, and included approximately $100 million of CIE impairments. Our ef fective tax rate for the ﬁrst-half of 2024 was 21.6%. For the full-year , we continue to expect the tax rate of approximately 22%. Next capital on slide 1 1. In the quarter we returned $4.4 billion to shareholders, including common stock dividends of $929 million and common stock repurchases of $3.5 billion. Given our higher than expected SCB requirement, we plan to moderate buybacks versus the levels of the second quarter . We will dynamically deploy capital to support our client franchise, while targeting a prudent buf fer above our new requirement. Our board also approved a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend to $3 per share beginning in the third quarter , a reﬂection of our priority to pay our shareholders a sustainable growing dividend and our conﬁdence in the increasing durability of our franchise. In conclusion, we generated solid returns for the ﬁrst-half of 2024, which reﬂects the strength of our interconnected businesses and the ongoing execution of our strategy . We made strong progress in growing our more durable revenue streams, including record ﬁrst-half revenues across FIC and equities ﬁnancing, management and other fees, and private banking and lending.

W e remain conﬁdent in our ability to drive strong returns for shareholders, while continuing to support our clients."," Thank you, operator , and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. I want to begin by addressing the horrible act of violence that occurred over the weekend, the attempted assassination of former President Trump. W e are grateful that he is safe. I also want to extend my sincere condolences to the families of those who were tragically killed and severely injured. It is a sad moment for our country . There is no place in our politics for violence. I urge people to come  together and to treat one another with respect, civility , dignity , especially when we disagree. W e cannot af ford division and distrust to get the better of us. I truly hope this is a moment that will spur reﬂection and action that celebrate, that celebrate what unites us as citizens and as a society . Turning to our performance. Our second quarter results were solid. W e delivered strong year-on-year growth in both global banking and markets and asset wealth management. I am pleased with our performance where we produced a 10.9% ROE for the second quarter and a 12.8% ROE for the ﬁrst-half of the year . We continue to harness our One Goldman Sachs operating approach to execute on our strategy and serve our clients in dynamic environments. Global banking and markets, we maintained our long-standing #1 rank in announcement completed M&A  and ranked #2 in equity underwriting. Our investment banking backlog is up signiﬁcantly this quarter . From what we're seeing, we are in the early innings of the capital markets and M&A  recovery . And while certain transaction volumes are still well below their 10-year averages, we remain very well positioned to beneﬁt from a continued resurgence in activity . We saw a solid year-over-year revenue growth across both FIC and equities as our global broad and deep franchise remained active in supporting clients' risk intermediation and ﬁnancing needs. W e continue to be focused on maximizing our wallet share and we have improved our standing to be in the top three with 1 18 of our top 150 clients. In asset wealth management, we are growing more durable management and other fees in private, banking, and lending revenues, which together were a record $3.2 billion for this quarter . Our Assets Under Supervision had a record of $2.9 trillion and total wealth management client assets rose to roughly $1.5 trillion. W e delivered a 23% margin for the ﬁrst-half of the year and are making progress on improving the return proﬁle of AWM. In alternatives, we raised $36 billion a year-to-date. W e completed a number of notable fund closings during the quarter , including $20 billion of total capital for private credit strategies, and approximately $10 billion across real estate investing strategies. Given the stronger-than-anticipated fundraising in the ﬁrst-half of the year , as well as our current pipeline, we expect to exceed $50 billion in alternatives fundraising this year . This is a testament to our investment performance, track record, and intense focus on client experience. W e are excited about the additional growth opportunities for our asset growth management platform. Let me turn to the operating environment, which remains top of mind for clients. On the one hand, there is a high level of geopolitical instability , elections across the globe could have signiﬁcant implications for forward policy , and inﬂation is proven to be stickier than many had anticipated. On the other hand the environment in the U.S. remains relatively constructive. Markets continue to forecast a soft landing as the expected economic growth trajectory improves and equity markets remain near all- time highs. I am particularly encouraged by the ongoing advancements in artiﬁcial intelligence. Recently , our Board of Directors spent a week in Silicon V alley where we spoke with the CEOs of many of the leading institutions at the cutting-edge of technology and AI. We all left with a sense of optimism about the application of AI tools and the accelerating innovation in technology more broadly . The proliferation of AI in the corporate world will bring with it signiﬁcant demand-related infrastructure and ﬁnancing needs, which should fuel activity across our broad franchise. Before I turn it over to Dennis, I want to cover a couple of additional topics that are top of mind for me. First, our recent stress test results. The year-over-year increase in our stress capital buf fer does not seem to reﬂect the strategic evolution of our business and the continuous progress we've made to reduce our stress loss intensity , which the Federal Reserve had recognized in our last three tests. Given this discrepancy , we are engaging with our regulators to better understand its determinations. Despite the increase in requirements, we remain very well positioned to serve our clients and will continue to be nimble with our capital. In the second quarter , we repurchased $3.5 billion of shares, which illustrates our ability to dynamically manage our resources and opportunistically return capital to the shareholders. Despite the increase in our repurchase activity , our common equity Tier 1 ratio ended the quarter at 14.8% under the standardized approach, 90 basis points above our new regulatory minimum and above our ratio in the ﬁrst quarter . We also announced a 9% increase in our quarterly dividend which underscores our conﬁdence in the durability of our franchise. Since the beginning of 2019, we have more than tripled our quarterly dividend to its current level of $3 a share. I'd also like to reﬂect on the signiﬁcant milestone we hit in the second quarter , our 25th anniversary as a public company . We went public in 1999, which is also the year I joined the ﬁrm, and it's been an eventful 25-years since then. W e have persevered through a number of signiﬁcant global events, including through the dotcom bubble, NASDAQ crash, September 1 1th, the ﬁnancial crisis, and the pandemic. When I look back at how we overcame these challenges, immediately think of our culture, one that has evolved, no doubt, but always stayed true to our core values. I know that the preservation of our culture is paramount to serving our clients with excellence, maintaining our leading market positions, growing our businesses, and continuing to attract and retain the most talented people. In closing, I'm very conﬁdent about the state of our client franchise. W e are delivering on our strategy by leaning into our core strengths ef fectively serving clients in what remains a complicated operating environment. Now let me turn it over to Dennis to cover our ﬁnancial results in more detail.
 Thank you, David, and good morning. Let's start with our results on page one of the presentation. In the second quarter , we generated net revenues of $12.7 billion and net earnings of $3 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $8.62, an ROE of 10.9%, and an ROTE of 1 1.6%.

2024_Q3," Thank you, operator , good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. In the third quarter , we produced net revenues of $12.7 billion and generated earnings per share of $8.40, an ROE of 10.4% and an ROTE of 1 1.1%. Overall, I am pleased with our performance especially in a quarter where our results were impacted by selected items including the narrowing of our consumer footprint which reduced our ROE by 80 basis points. Our performance demonstrates the strength of our world-class and interconnected franchises where we were ef fectively serving clients in a complex backdrop. Global Banking and Markets, we remained premier M&A  advisor and a leading global risk intermediary . Across investment banking, corporate and sponsors remained actively engaged and we see signiﬁcant pent-up demand from our clients. Our backlog rose again this quarter driven by advisory and we expect our leading investment banking franchises to beneﬁt from the continued resurgence in activity . In FIC, we delivered record ﬁnancing revenues and facilitated our clients’  risk intermediation needs, particularly as activity levels picked up towards the end of the quarter . And in equities, we reported a very strong performance across both intermediation and ﬁnancing. Overall, our global broad e-platform remained exceptionally well positioned to support our clients’  evolving needs across products and asset classes. In the Asset and W ealth Management, our position as a leading global active asset manager the top ﬁve alternatives player and a premier ultra-high network franchise afford us signiﬁcant opportunities in secular growth areas. Our assets under supervision reached another record this quarter surpassing $3 trillion, and representing our 27th consecutive quarter of long-term net inﬂows. W e demonstrated further growth and more durable management, other fees and private banking and lending revenues, which together were a record $3.4 billion this quarter and up 9% versus last year . We remain conﬁdent in our ability to grow these more durable revenues at a high single digit pace over the coming years, and alternatives fundraising remains strong. We raised over $50 billion year-to-date, and now expect 2024 fundraising to exceed 60 billion, as we see ongoing demand across asset classes, including private credit, private equity , secondaries, and infrastructure. Wealth management, we grew our total client assets to $1.6 trillion, and our ultra- high net worth franchise is well positioned to continue to grow globally as we expand our advisor footprint and our leading of ferings and our lending of ferings to clients. Our pre-tax margin in AWM is up meaningfully from last year and in line with our mid- 20s target. W e remain focused on further improving the margins and returns in this business, while also investing to drive growth across wealth management alternatives and solutions. As I look at the operating backdrop, the U.S. economy continues to be resilient. Inﬂation has been coming down, the recent unemployment data is supportive, and while we have seen some softness in consumer behavior , the tone of my recent conversations with clients has been quite constructed. The beginning of the rate cut cycle has renewed optimism for a soft landing, which should spur increased economic activity . More broadly , clients remain highly focused on the trajectory of rates in jurisdictions around the world. The policy implications of global elections, particularly in the U.S. and the high levels of geopolitical instability . Against this backdrop are leading global franchises in supporting our clients as they navigate risks and position themselves for a range of outcomes. Before I turn it over to Denis, I want to spend a moment on capital and Basel III revision. Although, we have closely followed the recent remarks from regulatory ofﬁcials about the upcoming reproposal, we continue to have concerns about the overall regulatory process. There remains a lack of transparency and appreciation for the interconnectedness of capital requirements across the proposed fundamental review of the trading book, CCAR and the G-SIB buf fer. We recognize this is an ongoing process that will take time, but as we've said before, we need to get this right. The ﬁnal rule have a signiﬁcant impact on the growth and competitiveness of the U.S. economy . Requiring too much capital will increase the cost of credit for businesses large and small, and will impact growth across the country . We look forward to receiving more clarity from our regulators once the reproposal is published and participating in the new comment period. W e remain very engaged both as an industry and as a ﬁrm. In closing, I feel very good about the trajectory of Goldman Sachs. W e are leaning into our strengths. Our client franchise is stronger than ever , and we continue to harness our one Goldman Sachs approach. Our world-class talent, execution capabilities, and risk management expertise are core to who we are as a ﬁrm and allow us to provide dif ferentiated service to our clients and outperform for shareholders through the cycle. Let me now turn it over to Denis to cover our ﬁnancial results in more detail.
 Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the third quarter , we generated net revenues of $12.7 billion, up 7% year-over-year . Earnings per share of $8.40 up 54% year-over-year , ROE of 10.4% and ROTE of 1 1.1%. As David mentioned, our results were impacted by select items, including agreements to transition the GM card platform and to sell our portfolio of seller ﬁnancing norms. In aggregate, these items reduced EPS by $0.62 and our ROE by 80 basis points. Now turning to performance by segment starting on Page 4. Global Banking and Markets produced revenues of $8.6 billion in the third quarter . Advisory revenues of $875 million were up both sequentially and versus the prior year period. W e remain number one in the league tables for announced and completed M&A  for the year-to- date. Equity underwriting revenues rose 25% year-over-year to $385 million. As equity capital markets have continued to reopen, though volumes are still well below longer-term averages. Debt underwriting revenues rose 46% year-over-year to $605 million amid higher leverage ﬁnance and investment grade activity . We are seeing increased client demand for committed acquisition ﬁnancing, which we expect to continue on the back of increasing M&A  activity . Overall, our investment banking backlog rose quarter-on-quarter driven by advisory . FIC net revenues of $3 billion in the quarter were down from a strong performance last year amid a relatively quieter summer , though we saw a meaningful pickup in activity in September . A decline in intermediation revenues was partially of fset by record FIC ﬁnancing revenues of $949 million, which rose 30% year-over-year , primarily on better results within mortgages and structured lending. Equities net revenues were $3.5 billion dollars in the quarter , up 18% versus the prior year. Equities intermediation revenues were $2.2 billion, up 29% year-over-year , primarily driven by strong performance across derivatives and cash products. Equities ﬁnancing revenues of $1.3 billion rose versus the prior year amid higher average balances. Across FIC and equities ﬁnancing revenues were a record $6.6 billion for the year-to-date, a direct result of the successful execution on our strategic priority to improve the durability of our revenue base. Moving to Asset and W ealth Management on Page 5. Revenues of $3.8 billion were up 16% year-over-year . Our more durable management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues reached a new record this quarter of $3.4 billion. Management and other fees increased 3% sequentially to a record $2.6 billion for the quarter and $7.6 billion for the year to-date well on the way to achieving our $10 billion annual target for 2024. Private banking and lending revenues rose sequentially to 756 million. We are seeing positive momentum in this business, and we remain focused on increasing lending penetration and expanding our loan product of ferings. Incentive fees for the quarter were $85 million. W e continue to expect to reach our annual target of $1 billion over the medium term, supported by approximately $4 billion of unrecognized incentive fees as of the last quarter . Equity and debt investments revenues totaled $294 million reﬂecting NII in our debt portfolio and markups in our public equity portfolio. For the year-to-date, we generated one and a half billion in combined equity and debt investments revenues. Now moving to Page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record of $3.1 trillion, bolstered by $37 billion of liquidity products net inﬂows, and $29 billion of long-term net inﬂows across asset classes. W e continue to see traction in our solutions business where we are leveraging our SMA  capabilities and outsource CIO platform to deliver customized multi-asset solutions. Turning to Page 7 on alternatives. Alternative AUS totaled $328 billion at the end of the third quarter , driving $527 million in management and other fees. Gross third- party fundraising was $16 billion in the third quarter and over $50 billion for the year- to-date. This brings cumulative third-party fundraising to more than $300 billion since our Investor Day in 2020. W e further reduced our historical principal investment portfolio by $1.7 billion in the third quarter to $10.9 billion, bringing year-to-date reductions to $5.4 billion. On Page 9, ﬁrmwide net interest income was $2.6 billion in the quarter up versus the prior year period, reﬂecting an increase in interest earning assets. Our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $192 billion up year-over-year , driven by an increase in other collateralized lending. For the third quarter , our provision for credit losses was $397 million, primarily driven by net charge of fs in our credit card portfolio and partially of fset by $70 million of net recoveries on previously impaired wholesale loans. Turning to expenses on Page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $8.3 billion. Our year-to-date compensation ratio net of provisions is 33.5%. Quarterly non-compensation expenses were $4.2 billion down 14% year-over-year . We remain focused on driving efﬁciencies across the ﬁrm, given ongoing inﬂationary pressures, competition for talent, and our desire to invest in our engineering and technology platforms. Our ef fective tax rate for the ﬁrst nine months of 2024 was 22.6%. For the full year , we continued to expect the tax rate of approximately 22%. Next capital on Slide 1 1. In the quarter , we returned $2 billion to common shareholders, including dividends of 978 million and stock repurchases of $1 billion. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.6% at the end of the third quarter under the standardized approach. During the quarter , the Federal Reserve reduced our SEB requirement by 20 basis points to 6.2%, following a successful appeal process, resulting in a standardized common equity Tier 1 ratio requirement of 13.7%, which became ef fective October 1st. We remain very engaged with our regulators on creating a less volatile and more transparent process. Given our 90-basis point buf fer, we continue to have ﬂexibility on capital deployment and are very well positioned to serve our clients and return capital to shareholders. In conclusion, our overall performance reﬂected the strength of our client franchise and the improving operating environment. W e are executing on our strategy where we are maintaining and strengthening our leadership positions across Global Banking and Markets and leaning into secular growth opportunities in Asset and Wealth Management. Across both businesses, we are making strong progress in growing our more durable revenue streams. Simply put, we are playing to our strengths as a ﬁrm and we remain conﬁdent in our ability to drive returns for shareholders while continuing to support our clients. With that, we will now open up the line for questions.","In FIC, we delivered record ﬁnancing revenues and facilitated our clients’  risk intermediation needs, particularly as activity levels picked up towards the end of the quarter .
W e demonstrated further growth and more durable management, other fees and private banking and lending revenues, which together were a record $3.4 billion this quarter and up 9% versus last year .
We raised over $50 billion year-to-date, and now expect 2024 fundraising to exceed 60 billion, as we see ongoing demand across asset classes, including private credit, private equity , secondaries, and infrastructure.
Wealth management, we grew our total client assets to $1.6 trillion, and our ultra- high net worth franchise is well positioned to continue to grow globally as we expand our advisor footprint and our leading of ferings and our lending of ferings to clients.

Thank you all for joining us. In the third quarter , we produced net revenues of $12.7 billion and generated earnings per share of $8.40, an ROE of 10.4% and an ROTE of 1 1.1%. Overall, I am pleased with our performance especially in a quarter where our results were impacted by selected items including the narrowing of our consumer footprint which reduced our ROE by 80 basis points. Our performance demonstrates the strength of our world-class and interconnected franchises where we were ef fectively serving clients in a complex backdrop. Global Banking and Markets, we remained premier M&A  advisor and a leading global risk intermediary . Across investment banking, corporate and sponsors remained actively engaged and we see signiﬁcant pent-up demand from our clients. Our backlog rose again this quarter driven by advisory and we expect our leading investment banking franchises to beneﬁt from the continued resurgence in activity . In FIC, we delivered record ﬁnancing revenues and facilitated our clients’  risk intermediation needs, particularly as activity levels picked up towards the end of the quarter . And in equities, we reported a very strong performance across both intermediation and ﬁnancing. Overall, our global broad e-platform remained exceptionally well positioned to support our clients’  evolving needs across products and asset classes. In the Asset and W ealth Management, our position as a leading global active asset manager the top ﬁve alternatives player and a premier ultra-high network franchise afford us signiﬁcant opportunities in secular growth areas. Our assets under supervision reached another record this quarter surpassing $3 trillion, and representing our 27th consecutive quarter of long-term net inﬂows. W e demonstrated further growth and more durable management, other fees and private banking and lending revenues, which together were a record $3.4 billion this quarter and up 9% versus last year . We remain conﬁdent in our ability to grow these more durable revenues at a high single digit pace over the coming years, and alternatives fundraising remains strong. We raised over $50 billion year-to-date, and now expect 2024 fundraising to exceed 60 billion, as we see ongoing demand across asset classes, including private credit, private equity , secondaries, and infrastructure. Wealth management, we grew our total client assets to $1.6 trillion, and our ultra- high net worth franchise is well positioned to continue to grow globally as we expand our advisor footprint and our leading of ferings and our lending of ferings to clients. Our pre-tax margin in AWM is up meaningfully from last year and in line with our mid- 20s target. W e remain focused on further improving the margins and returns in this business, while also investing to drive growth across wealth management alternatives and solutions. As I look at the operating backdrop, the U.S. economy continues to be resilient. Inﬂation has been coming down, the recent unemployment data is supportive, and while we have seen some softness in consumer behavior , the tone of my recent conversations with clients has been quite constructed. The beginning of the rate cut cycle has renewed optimism for a soft landing, which should spur increased economic activity . More broadly , clients remain highly focused on the trajectory of rates in jurisdictions around the world. The policy implications of global elections, particularly in the U.S. and the high levels of geopolitical instability . Against this backdrop are leading global franchises in supporting our clients as they navigate risks and position themselves for a range of outcomes. Before I turn it over to Denis, I want to spend a moment on capital and Basel III revision. Although, we have closely followed the recent remarks from regulatory ofﬁcials about the upcoming reproposal, we continue to have concerns about the overall regulatory process. There remains a lack of transparency and appreciation for the interconnectedness of capital requirements across the proposed fundamental review of the trading book, CCAR and the G-SIB buf fer. We recognize this is an ongoing process that will take time, but as we've said before, we need to get this right. The ﬁnal rule have a signiﬁcant impact on the growth and competitiveness of the U.S. economy . Requiring too much capital will increase the cost of credit for businesses large and small, and will impact growth across the country . We look forward to receiving more clarity from our regulators once the reproposal is published and participating in the new comment period. W e remain very engaged both as an industry and as a ﬁrm. In closing, I feel very good about the trajectory of Goldman Sachs. W e are leaning into our strengths. Our client franchise is stronger than ever , and we continue to harness our one Goldman Sachs approach. Our world-class talent, execution capabilities, and risk management expertise are core to who we are as a ﬁrm and allow us to provide dif ferentiated service to our clients and outperform for shareholders through the cycle.

2024_Q4," Thank you, operator , and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. Before I start my prepared remarks, I'd like to take a moment to touch on the devastating ﬁres that have spread across Los Angeles. Our thoughts are with the people of LA, including our colleagues and clients. W e join everyone else in thanking the brave ﬁve ﬁreﬁghters and ﬁrst responders working tirelessly to protect that community . Now let me turn to our results.

For the full year , we increased our revenues by 16% to $53.5 billion. W e grew our EPS by 77% to $40.54 and improved our ROE by over 500 basis points to 12.7% demonstrating strong operating leverage. Before we review our ﬁnancials in detail, I will start today's presentation with a strategic update. Beginning on Page 1, we have a clear purpose at Goldman Sachs. We aspire to be the world's most exceptional ﬁnancial institution, united by our shared values of client service, partnership, integrity and excellence. These values are the foundation of our strategy and enable us to deliver for our clients and our shareholders. As shown on Page 2, our interconnected client franchises are at the core of our growth strategy . Our Global Banking and Markets business is distinguished by its scale, proﬁtability and leadership positions. In Investment banking, we once again ended the year as the number one M&A  advisor . In markets, we have the number one equities business and a leading ﬁt franchise. These leadership positions have been built over decades of investment and they reﬂect the conﬁdence and trust that our clients have in us. Our Asset and W ealth Management business is comprised of a leading global active asset manager , a top ﬁve alternatives franchise and a premier ultra-high net worth wealth management business. This scaled business has over $3.1 trillion in assets under supervision with global breadth and depth across products and solutions. Importantly , our One Goldman Sachs operating philosophy drives the interconnectedness between these two world-class businesses, enabling us to seamlessly deliver a variety of unique solutions and execution capabilities to our clients. Turning to Page 3. Delivering excellence to our clients is only possible because of our greatest asset, our people. Their exceptional focus and dedication supported by our culture of collaboration and excellence is critical in solving our clients' most consequential problems. Our people, history and culture have made Goldman Sachs an aspirational brand around the globe, which allows us to attract quality talent across the organization from our summer interns all the way to our partners, and we invest heavily in our people. Many of them have long careers at the ﬁrm, exempliﬁed by the fact that over 40% of our partners started as campus hires. Of course, not all of our people stay at Goldman Sachs for their entire careers. Many believe for opportunities to lead other companies and investment ﬁrms. And these ﬁrms, in turn, often become important clients of Goldman Sachs. Today , more than 275 of our alumni are in C-suite roles at companies with either a market cap greater than $1 billion or assets under management of over $5 billion and hundreds of other alumni end up coming back to the ﬁrm as Boomerang hires, including roughly 25 partners and managing directors last year alone, a testament to our enduring brand and culture. All in, we have an exceptional client franchise supported by our best-in-class talent and culture, which enables us to drive our strategy forward, and it is critical that we continue to invest in our people. Now turning to Page 4. At our ﬁrst Investor Day in 2020, we laid out a comprehensive strategy to strengthen and grow the ﬁrm. W e also laid out a number of targets that we could be held accountable for our progress. Today , the evidence is clear , we have met or exceeded almost all of these targets. W e have grown our revenues from $37 billion to $54 billion, nearly 50% while improving the durability of those revenue streams. In Global Banking and Markets, we've maintained our position as the leading M&A adviser in Investment banking and have improved our standing with the top 150 clients and thicken equities over the past ﬁve years. At the same time, we've signiﬁcantly increased our more durable FICC and equity ﬁnancing revenues, which together have grown at a 15% CAGR to a new record of $9.1 billion this year . In Asset & W ealth Management, we've consistently grown our more durable management and other fees in private banking and lending revenues, both of which were record in 2024. Notably , management and other fees surpassed $10 billion, exceeding our 2024 target. In addition, alternative fundraising surpassed $70 billion. The success is a direct result of our continued innovation developing new strategies and our long-standing track record of investment performance. Additionally , we further narrowed our strategic focus. W e closed on the sale of GreenSky entered into an agreement with General Motors to transition their credit card program and sold our portfolio of seller ﬁnancing loans. Turning to Page 5. Global Banking & Markets, our leading franchise has produced average revenues of $33 billion and an average ROE of 16% over the last ﬁve years across a variety of market environments, demonstrating the diversity and strength of this business. While no one has a crystal ball, there are a number of catalysts that we believe will continue to drive activity . There has been a meaningful shift in CEO conﬁdence, particularly following the results of the U.S. election. Additionally , there is a signiﬁcant backlog from sponsors and an overall increased appetite for dealmaking supported by an improving regulatory backdrop. The combination of these conditions should spur further activity in 2025. One large strategic opportunity we are particularly focused on relates to ﬁnancing. Goldman Sachs operates the fulcrum of one of the most important structural trends currently taking place in ﬁnance. The emergence and growth of our private credit and other asset classes that can be privately deployed. Our unique origination capabilities position us to both connect companies' dependable capital and connect investors to assets that can produce superior returns. Earlier this week, we announced the formation of our Capital Solutions Group, which will harness the power of One Goldman Sachs to provide our clients a comprehensive suite of our ﬁnancing, origination, structuring and risk management offerings across both public and private markets. W e are taking the current capabilities of our ﬁnancing group, adding coverage of ﬁnancial sponsors and alternative asset management ﬁrms to better innovate and accelerate the delivery of services to clients. We are also creating an alternative origination group focused on sourcing to provide seamless coverage to our private credit and private equity clients. W e are excited about providing our clients with access to dif ferentiated sourcing and investment capabilities, which will in turn help us accelerate growth across the franchise. Now let me turn to Asset & W ealth Management on Page 6. Our assets under supervision reached another record, reﬂecting our 28th consecutive quarter of long- term fee based net inﬂows. In W ealth Management, our total client assets rose to $1.6 trillion. W e also bolstered our more durable revenue streams. Management and other fees and private banking and lending revenues together have grown at a CAGR of 12% since 2019, and we continue to expect to drive high-single digit annual growth in the coming years. Turning to Page 7. W e meaningfully improved our AWM pretax margin in 2024, achieving our medium-term target. In our journey to further improve the return proﬁle of the ﬁrm, we are committed to driving this business towards mid-teens returns. W e see signiﬁcant growth opportunities across wealth management, alternatives and solutions. In Wealth Management, we are growing this business by increasing the number of advisers in the ﬁeld and surrounding them with content specialists. W e are expanding our loan product of ferings, and we're elevating our overall client experience with further investment in our digital capabilities. In alternatives, we are scaling our ﬂagship fund program and developing new strategies. W e remain focused on penetrating the institutional client base and expanding our wealth channel. Additionally , we are investing in tailored solutions for institutional and third-party wealth clients, who continue to see customization across SMAs, direct indexing and ETFs in a structured form. On Page 8, we demonstrate the durability of the revenues across the ﬁrm. This is not the ﬁrst time we've laid out this information, but it serves as a good reminder . Baseline revenues are shown in gray , which represent the sum of the trailing 10-year lows for each of the businesses that are considered to be more cyclical advisory , underwriting and intermediation. As I said last year , we believe this is a very conservative measurement because it's unlikely that every one of these businesses would ever hit a low point all at the same time. In the 25 years since we became a public company , it hasn't happened once. The dark blue represents more durable revenues from ﬁnancing, management and other fees as well as private banking and lending, which grew 13% versus 2023. Taken together , these two components made up approximately 70% of total revenues in 2024. In addition, given our diversiﬁed franchise, we have consistently demonstrated our ability to generate upside across dif ferent market environments, which further highlights the revenue generating power of our ﬁrm. Moving to Page 9. Operating efﬁciency remains one of our key strategic objectives. And while we have made progress, we believe there are signiﬁcant opportunities to drive further efﬁciencies across our business. W e've established a three year program as a part of our business planning process that will help us dynamically manage our expense base, harness technology and automation, and reinvest in our businesses. First, we are optimizing our organizational footprint by expanding our presence in strategic locations and calibrating our pyramid structure. Second, on spend management, we are optimizing transaction based expenses and looking to more efﬁciently manage our vendor and consultant relationships. W e will also continue to reduce operating expense associated with our consolidated investment entities as we further sell down those assets. Lastly , we are leveraging AI solutions to scale and transform our engineering capabilities, simplify and modernize our technology stack, drive productivity . These efﬁciencies will allow us to further invest for growth and improve client experience. Moving to Page 10. W e believe the path to our return targets is straightforward. First, we have demonstrated our ability to deliver mid-teens returns on our leading global banking and markets franchise. Second, we are making strong progress against our plan to drive asset wealth management to mid-teens and beyond. And lastly , we are driving platform solutions to pretax breakeven in 2025. Taken together , we have a clear path to producing our target returns, which will further unlock shareholder value. Before turning it over to Denis, I want to spend a moment on regulation. Last month, trade groups representing the major U.S. banks, including Goldman Sachs, ﬁled suit against the Federal Reserve. W e have long been concerned that the lack of transparency and the Fed's current stress testing creates uncertainty and at times produces results we cannot understand and which can lead to higher industry-wide borrowing costs, reduced market liquidity and inefﬁcient capital allocations. For the industry , the bar to take this step was incredibly high. And while the Fed has announced that it's seeking to improve the stress test, the suit was ﬁled to protect our rights. W e believe it is our responsibility to continue to press for a more transparent regulatory process in order to foster a more efﬁcient ﬁnancial system that supports growth and competitiveness of the U.S. economy . In closing, I'm very conﬁdent about the trajectory of Goldman Sachs. W e are incredibly well positioned to serve our clients and to continue to drive strong returns for shareholders as we execute with a relentless emphasis on client service, partnership, integrity and excellence. Let me now turn it over to Denis to cover our ﬁnancial results in more detail.
 Thank you, David, and good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 1 of the presentation. In the fourth quarter , we generated net revenues of $13.9 billion, EPS of $1 1.95, and ROE of 14.6% and an ROTE of 15.5%, resulting in full year EPS of $40.54 and an ROE of 12.7%. As David highlighted, we made signiﬁcant progress this year on executing our strategic priorities. In aggregate, these select items had a de minimis impact on the ﬁrm's full year results. Turning to results by segment. Starting on Page 14. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $35 billion for the year , up 16% amid broad based strength versus last year . In the fourth quarter , Investment banking fees of $2.1 billion rose 24% year-over-year . Advisory revenues came in at $960 million and equity underwriting revenues increased substantially year-over-year to $499 million, as strong equity markets supported robust issuance activity . Net underwriting revenues rose 51% to $595 million amid higher leveraged ﬁnance activity , given the strengthening ﬁnancing conditions post-election. For 2024, we maintained our number one position in the league tables for announced and completed M&A, ranked third in equity underwriting, and second in leverage lending. Despite strong accruals in the fourth quarter , our Investment Banking backlog rose sequentially and remains robust, particularly in advisory . The intensity of our client dialogues has been increasing, and we're seeing renewed CEO conﬁdence and desire from sponsors to transact. While there remains some policy uncertainty , there is an expectation that the regulatory burden will be reduced, which should serve as a tailwind to risk assets and capital deployment. W e are optimistic on the outlook for 2025 and expect a further pickup in M&A  and IPO activity . FICC net revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter , up 35% year-over-year . In intermediation, we saw strength in currencies and mortgages. Record FICC ﬁnancing revenues rose 34% versus last year , primarily on better results within mortgages and structured lending. Equities net revenues were $3.5 billion in the quarter . Equities intermediation revenues were $2 billion, up 30% year-over-year , primarily driven by strong performance in cash products. Record Equities ﬁnancing revenues of $1.5 billion rose 36% versus the prior year amid higher average balances in prime and stronger performance in portfolio ﬁnancing. For the full year , total equities net revenues were a record $13.4 billion amidst strong levels of client engagement and higher client balances. Across FICC and Equities, ﬁnancing revenues rose 17% in 2024 to a record $9.1 billion. Moving to Asset & W ealth Management on Page 15. For 2024, revenues of $16.1 billion rose 16% year-over-year as our more durable revenues grew to new records. In the quarter , management and other fees were a record $2.8 billion, up 8% sequentially and 15% year-over-year . Private banking and lending revenues rose 11% year-over-year to $736 million. Incentive fees for the quarter were $174 million, bringing our full year incentive fees to $393 million. W e expect to make further progress in 2025 towards our annual target of $1 billion. Equity and debt investment revenues totaled $993 million for the quarter , reﬂecting markups across our private and public portfolios and NII in our debt portfolio. For the full year , these combined revenues totaled $2.4 billion. Now moving to Page 16. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $3.1 trillion, driven by $70 billion of liquidity products net inﬂows and $22 billion of long-term fee based net inﬂows across asset classes. Turning to Page 17 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $336 billion at the end of the fourth quarter , driving $621 million in management and other fees. Gross third-party fundraising was $20 billion in the fourth quarter and $72 billion for the year . For 2025, we expect fundraising to be consistent with levels achieved in recent years. On Page 19, our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $196 billion, up year-over- year, reﬂecting an increase in other collateralized lending. Our provision for credit losses was $351 million in the quarter , primarily driven by net charge-of fs in our credit card portfolio and balance growth, partially of fset by reserve releases in the wholesale portfolio. Let's turn to expenses on Page 20. Total operating expenses for the year were $33.8 billion. Our 2024 compensation ratio net of provisions was 32%. Quarterly non- compensation expenses were $4.5 billion, down 8% year-over-year . As David mentioned, we're driving efﬁciencies across our organizational structure, spend management and automation ef forts, which will enable us to further invest across the client franchise. These ef forts are designed to enhance productivity and help drive operating leverage, as we work towards achieving our through-the-cycle targets. Our ef fective tax rate for 2024 was 22.4%. For 2025, we expect a tax rate of approximately 20%. Next, capital on Slide 21. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 15% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, a 130 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13.7%. In the fourth quarter , we returned approximately $3 billion to common shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $2 billion and dividends of $965 million. In conclusion, our strong performance this year reﬂects the strength of our client franchise, our intense focus on execution and an improving operating environment. We continue to maintain our leadership positions across Global Banking & Markets and are leaning into secular growth opportunities across Asset & W ealth Management. As we enter 2025, we remain conﬁdent in our ability to deliver for clients and drive strong returns for shareholders. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.","For the full year , we increased our revenues by 16% to $53.5 billion.

 Thank you, David, and good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 1 of the presentation. In the fourth quarter , we generated net revenues of $13.9 billion, EPS of $1 1.95, and ROE of 14.6% and an ROTE of 15.5%, resulting in full year EPS of $40.54 and an ROE of 12.7%. As David highlighted, we made signiﬁcant progress this year on executing our strategic priorities. In aggregate, these select items had a de minimis impact on the ﬁrm's full year results. Turning to results by segment. Starting on Page 14. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $35 billion for the year , up 16% amid broad based strength versus last year . In the fourth quarter , Investment banking fees of $2.1 billion rose 24% year-over-year . Advisory revenues came in at $960 million and equity underwriting revenues increased substantially year-over-year to $499 million, as strong equity markets supported robust issuance activity . Net underwriting revenues rose 51% to $595 million amid higher leveraged ﬁnance activity , given the strengthening ﬁnancing conditions post-election. For 2024, we maintained our number one position in the league tables for announced and completed M&A, ranked third in equity underwriting, and second in leverage lending. Despite strong accruals in the fourth quarter , our Investment Banking backlog rose sequentially and remains robust, particularly in advisory . The intensity of our client dialogues has been increasing, and we're seeing renewed CEO conﬁdence and desire from sponsors to transact. While there remains some policy uncertainty , there is an expectation that the regulatory burden will be reduced, which should serve as a tailwind to risk assets and capital deployment. W e are optimistic on the outlook for 2025 and expect a further pickup in M&A  and IPO activity . FICC net revenues were $2.7 billion in the quarter , up 35% year-over-year . In intermediation, we saw strength in currencies and mortgages. Record FICC ﬁnancing revenues rose 34% versus last year , primarily on better results within mortgages and structured lending. Equities net revenues were $3.5 billion in the quarter . Equities intermediation revenues were $2 billion, up 30% year-over-year , primarily driven by strong performance in cash products. Record Equities ﬁnancing revenues of $1.5 billion rose 36% versus the prior year amid higher average balances in prime and stronger performance in portfolio ﬁnancing. For the full year , total equities net revenues were a record $13.4 billion amidst strong levels of client engagement and higher client balances. Across FICC and Equities, ﬁnancing revenues rose 17% in 2024 to a record $9.1 billion. Moving to Asset & W ealth Management on Page 15. For 2024, revenues of $16.1 billion rose 16% year-over-year as our more durable revenues grew to new records. In the quarter , management and other fees were a record $2.8 billion, up 8% sequentially and 15% year-over-year . Private banking and lending revenues rose 11% year-over-year to $736 million. Incentive fees for the quarter were $174 million, bringing our full year incentive fees to $393 million. W e expect to make further progress in 2025 towards our annual target of $1 billion. Equity and debt investment revenues totaled $993 million for the quarter , reﬂecting markups across our private and public portfolios and NII in our debt portfolio. For the full year , these combined revenues totaled $2.4 billion. Now moving to Page 16. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $3.1 trillion, driven by $70 billion of liquidity products net inﬂows and $22 billion of long-term fee based net inﬂows across asset classes. Turning to Page 17 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $336 billion at the end of the fourth quarter , driving $621 million in management and other fees. Gross third-party fundraising was $20 billion in the fourth quarter and $72 billion for the year . For 2025, we expect fundraising to be consistent with levels achieved in recent years. On Page 19, our total loan portfolio at quarter end was $196 billion, up year-over- year, reﬂecting an increase in other collateralized lending. Our provision for credit losses was $351 million in the quarter , primarily driven by net charge-of fs in our credit card portfolio and balance growth, partially of fset by reserve releases in the wholesale portfolio. Let's turn to expenses on Page 20. Total operating expenses for the year were $33.8 billion. Our 2024 compensation ratio net of provisions was 32%. Quarterly non- compensation expenses were $4.5 billion, down 8% year-over-year . As David mentioned, we're driving efﬁciencies across our organizational structure, spend management and automation ef forts, which will enable us to further invest across the client franchise. These ef forts are designed to enhance productivity and help drive operating leverage, as we work towards achieving our through-the-cycle targets. Our ef fective tax rate for 2024 was 22.4%. For 2025, we expect a tax rate of approximately 20%. Next, capital on Slide 21. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 15% at the end of the fourth quarter under the standardized approach, a 130 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13.7%. In the fourth quarter , we returned approximately $3 billion to common shareholders, including common stock repurchases of $2 billion and dividends of $965 million. In conclusion, our strong performance this year reﬂects the strength of our client franchise, our intense focus on execution and an improving operating environment. We continue to maintain our leadership positions across Global Banking & Markets and are leaning into secular growth opportunities across Asset & W ealth Management. As we enter 2025, we remain conﬁdent in our ability to deliver for clients and drive strong returns for shareholders. With that, we'll now open up the line for questions.","I'm very pleased with our strong performance as we continue to serve our clients in a dynamic environment. In the fourth quarter , we generated revenues of $13.9 billion, earnings per share of $1 1.95, and ROE of 14.6% and an ROTE of 15.5%. For the full year , we increased our revenues by 16% to $53.5 billion. W e grew our EPS by 77%. We improved our ROE by over 500 basis points to 12.7%. We have a clear purpose at Goldman Sachs. We aspire to be the world's most exceptional ﬁnancial institution, united by our shared values of client service, partnership, integrity and excellence. Our people, history and culture have made Goldman Sachs an aspirational brand.","Good day, and welcome to the Goldman Sachs fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings conference call.

2025_Q1," Thank you very much, operator . Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. In the ﬁrst quarter , we generated net revenues of $15.1 billion, earnings per share of $14.12, an ROE of 16.9% and an ROTE of 18%. In a highly dynamic environment, we produced very strong results. This quarter was characterized by rapidly shifting sentiment with the market backdrop ending in a very different place than where it started. Still, our leading global franchise underpinned by our best-in-class talent, risk management, and execution capabilities delivered for our clients. Our performance underscores the importance of having a scaled franchise with a presence around the world. Being a leading global ﬁnancial institution requires a deep expertise and diversiﬁcation that can only come from long-term consistent investment in our client franchise, a deep risk management culture, and our strong people. This is what brings clients to Goldman Sachs. In Global Banking & Markets, ongoing policy uncertainty and market volatility drove many clients to reposition their portfolios, driving higher activity in our FICC and equities businesses. I'm proud that we were able to support the intermediation and ﬁnancing needs of our clients, all while keeping a keen eye on risk management. In these businesses, we have demonstrated our ability to deliver strong results in a broad array of market environments. W e've consistently grown ﬁnancing and while intermediation activity across various asset classes can ebb and ﬂow in any given quarter , our overall results have been remarkably resilient over time. In Investment banking, the volatile backdrop led to more muted activity relative to the levels we had expected coming into the year , but it is especially in environments like this that clients come to Goldman Sachs for help with their most important strategic decisions. W e are the number one M&A  advisor globally and have been for the last 20 years. We've built our leadership position through decades of investment and our incredible teams in the Americas, Europe and Asia. This allows us to help clients execute marquee transactions like Google's $32 billion acquisition of Wiz, the largest transaction in Israeli history or the $24 billion take private of W algreens Boots Alliance, a ﬁrm with presence across the US, Europe and Latin America. As we stand today , our client dialogues remain elevated and our backlog is up for the fourth consecutive quarter . That being said, our ability to execute on these transactions will, of course, be dependent on market conditions. In Asset & W ealth Management, our clients continue to come to us for the quality of our advice and track record of investing acumen across asset classes, which is especially valued in turbulent markets. This quarter , our assets under supervision rose to a record of $3.2 trillion. This represents our 29th consecutive quarter of long- term fee-based net inﬂows, and we're making strong progress across our key growth opportunities in this business, alternatives, wealth management and solutions. At alternatives, our long track record of performance continues to support our fundraising ef forts. W e raised another $19 billion in the quarter , bringing our total fundraising of alternatives since 2019 to $342 billion. W e also recently launched multiple ﬂagship funds across strategies, including infrastructure, growth equity , and private credit. In Wealth Management, we continue to scale our premier ultra-high net worth franchise. Total W ealth Management revenue grew 1 1% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, while client assets reached another record of $1.6 trillion. Supporting this platform, we have over 1,000 private wealth advisors with an average tenure of more than 15 years. Leveraging the ﬁrm's investment platform, global network and banking capabilities, they work tirelessly to deliver unique and tailored solutions to our ultra- high net worth clients. We recently received a number of accolades from Euromoney , including being named the W orld's Best Private bank for 2025. These awards are a recognition of our excellence and longstanding commitment to serving the needs of our ultra-high net worth client base. Across our businesses, our clear priority is to serve clients with excellence. To that end, we are always seeking ways to enhance the client experience while improving efﬁciency . As highlighted in our strategic update this January , we are investing to strengthen our franchise and operate more ef fectively at scale. This includes taking steps to unlock efﬁciencies in technology and automation. As an example, we are leveraging AI solutions to scale and transform our engineering capabilities as well as to simplify and modernize our technology stack. Today , many of our people have access to Generative AI powered tools to help them serve clients more efﬁciently and increase productivity . These include a developer co-pilot coding assistant and a natural language GS AI assistant. W e continue to believe an acceleration in AI adoption will allow for further efﬁciencies for our own business and for companies large and small. As it is utilized more broadly , productivity gains for the economy will be signiﬁcant. Turning to the macroeconomic backdrop more broadly , as I said at the outset, we are entering the second quarter with a markedly dif ferent operating environment than earlier this year . Our economists' expectation for growth in the US has fallen meaningfully from over 2% to 0.5%. The prospect of a recession has increased with growing indications that economic activity is slowing down around the world. Our clients, including corporate CEOs and institutional investors are concerned by the signiﬁcant near-term and longer-term uncertainty that has constrained their ability to make important decisions. This uncertainty around the path forward and fears over the potentially escalating ef fects of the trade war have created material risks to the US and global economy . We are encouraged by the administration's recent actions to pursue a more gradual policy process that allows for considered negotiations with many countries, but how policies will evolve is still unknown. W e are hopeful that feedback from companies large and small, institutional investors, and ultimately consumers will support an approach that will lead to greater economic certainty and long-term growth. In the meantime, markets will likely continue to be volatile until we have further clarity . The administration's focus on trade barriers and strengthening the US competitive position is commendable. At the same time, it is important to recognize that few companies have beneﬁted more from a post-W orld W ar II economic and ﬁnancial order than the US. This doesn't mean meaningful reform in certain areas is not warranted. Today , the US is the largest, most dynamic and resilient economy with the dollar as a reserve currency . We have the broadest and deepest capital markets, which help fuel an unparalleled culture of innovation in sectors like technology and healthcare. These strengths, among others, give us the opportunity to think about how to attract and embed strategic manufacturing as an important driver of the 21st century economy . As a country , it is vital that we continue to leverage our considerable strengths as the global trading system for goods and services adjusts and evolves. On capital and regulation more broadly , we appreciate the administration's strong focus on appropriately calibrating regulation for the ﬁnancial services industry . Following the recent nomination of Michelle Bowman as V ice-Chairman of Supervision at the Federal Reserve, we will continue to actively engage on these matters and hope to see material progress across capital, leverage, liquidity , and supervision. As this quarter has shown, it's impossible to predict market outcomes, but it has also demonstrated once again that in times of great uncertainty , clients turn to Goldman Sachs for execution and insight, and our leading franchises have never been better positioned to support our clients. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover the ﬁnancial results for the quarter .
 Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the ﬁrst quarter , we generated net revenues of $15.1 billion, earnings per share of $14.12, and an ROE of 16.9%. W e provide details on selected items in the bottom table, which in total reduced our EPS by $0.25 and ROE by 30 basis points. Let's turn to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $10.7 billion in the ﬁrst quarter and generated an ROE of over 20%. Turning to Page 4, advisory revenues of $792 million were down versus a strong performance a year ago. W e remained number one in the league tables for M&A  with a lead of over $70 billion in announced volumes versus our next closest peer . Equity underwriting revenues of $370 million were ﬂat year-over-year , while debt underwriting revenues of $752 million rose 8%, driven by asset-backed and investment-grade activity . We ranked ﬁrst in equity & equity-related underwriting and ranked second in both high yield debt underwriting and leverage lending. Across Investment banking, our backlog rose sequentially , driven by a notable increase in advisory . FICC net revenues were $4.4 billion in the quarter . Intermediation results were driven by higher client activity in currencies and mortgages, of fset by lower performance in credit, rates and commodities versus a strong prior year . We produced record FICC ﬁnancing revenues of $1 billion, driven by solid performance in mortgages and structured lending. W e remain conﬁdent in our ability to prudently grow this business over time and always with an eye towards risk management. Equities net revenues were a record $4.2 billion in the quarter . Equities intermediation revenues of $2.5 billion rose 28% year-over-year , primarily driven by strong performance in derivatives. Record equities ﬁnancing revenues of $1.6 billion were higher year-over-year on better portfolio ﬁnancing results and record average prime balances for the quarter . Across FICC and equities, ﬁnancing revenues of $2.7 billion rose 22% versus the prior year , reaching a new record for a ﬁfth consecutive quarter . Let's turn to Page 5. Asset & W ealth Management revenues were $3.7 billion. Management and other fees were up 10% year-over-year to $2.7 billion on higher average assets under supervision and down slightly versus the fourth quarter , driven by other fees, which include placement fees that can vary from quarter to quarter . Incentive fees were $129 million, up year-over-year despite the difﬁcult monetization environment during the quarter . We expect to make progress on our target of $1 billion in annual incentive fees over the medium term, supported by an estimated $4.1 billion of unrecognized incentive fees as of year-end. Private banking and lending revenues were $725 million, up 6% year-over-year on higher lending revenues. Sequentially , results were roughly ﬂat as NIM compression on deposits was of fset by lending revenue growth. In aggregate, our more durable revenues of $3.4 billion across Management and other fees and Private banking and lending grew 9% versus the prior year . We continue to expect high single-digit annual growth in these lines over time. Revenues from equity investments and debt investments totaled $122 million, largely driven by net interest income in our debt portfolio. Within equity investments, net gains in our private portfolio were more than of fset by declines in our public portfolio amid the more challenging market backdrop during the quarter . In the AWM segment, we generated 21% pre-tax margin and roughly 10% ROE. Excluding the impact of historical principal investments and approximately $4 billion of attributed equity , our pre-tax margin would have been 2 percentage points higher and ROE 2.6 percentage points higher . Now moving to Page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $3.2 trillion. W e had $29 billion of long-term net inﬂows across asset classes, representing our 29th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inﬂows. Turning to Page 7 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $341 billion at the end of the ﬁrst quarter , driving $523 million in Management and Other fees. Gross third-party alternatives fundraising was $19 billion in the quarter . We continue to expect fundraising to be in line with recent years, though this outlook could be impacted by market conditions. On Page 9, ﬁrm-wide net interest income was $2.9 billion in the ﬁrst quarter , up sequentially on a decline in funding costs. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $210 billion, up versus the fourth quarter , primarily reﬂecting an increase in other collateralized lending. Our provision for credit losses of $287 million, primarily reﬂects net provisions related to the credit card portfolio, which were driven by net charge-of fs, partially of fset by releases following a seasonal paydown of card balances. Turning to expenses on Page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $9.1 billion, resulting in an efﬁciency ratio of 60.6%. Our compensation ratio net of provisions, was 33%. Non-compensation expenses were $4.3 billion. David mentioned, we continue to execute on our three-year efﬁciency plan that we laid out in January , including making adjustments to our pyramid structure. Our ef fective tax rate for the quarter of 16.1% beneﬁted from the impact of employee stock-based compensation. Excluding this impact, our ef fective tax rate would have been roughly 9 points higher . For the full year , we expect a tax rate of approximately 21%. Now on to Slide 1 1. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.8% at the end of the ﬁrst quarter under the standardized approach, 1 10 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13.7%. In the quarter , we returned $5.3 billion to common shareholders, including record common stock repurchases of $4.4 billion and common stock dividends of $976 million. W e will dynamically deploy capital to support our client franchise while also returning capital to shareholders. W e remain committed to paying our shareholders a sustainable and growing dividend. Importantly , our Board recently authorized a multi-year share repurchase program of up to $40 billion, providing us increased capital management ﬂexibility . In conclusion, our performance once again reﬂects the diversiﬁcation and strength of our leading client franchises, which enable us to deliver for our clients across a range of market backdrops. W e are conﬁdent in our ability to continue to support our clients as they navigate this dynamic operating environment. With that, we will now open up the line for questions.","In the ﬁrst quarter , we generated net revenues of $15.1 billion, earnings per share of $14.12, an ROE of 16.9% and an ROTE of 18%.

W e are conﬁdent in our ability to continue to support our clients as they navigate this dynamic operating environment."," Thank you very much, operator . Good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us. In the ﬁrst quarter , we generated net revenues of $15.1 billion, earnings per share of $14.12, an ROE of 16.9% and an ROTE of 18%. In a highly dynamic environment, we produced very strong results. This quarter was characterized by rapidly shifting sentiment with the market backdrop ending in a very different place than where it started. Still, our leading global franchise underpinned by our best-in-class talent, risk management, and execution capabilities delivered for our clients. Our performance underscores the importance of having a scaled franchise with a presence around the world. Being a leading global ﬁnancial institution requires a deep expertise and diversiﬁcation that can only come from long-term consistent investment in our client franchise, a deep risk management culture, and our strong people. This is what brings clients to Goldman Sachs. In Global Banking & Markets, ongoing policy uncertainty and market volatility drove many clients to reposition their portfolios, driving higher activity in our FICC and equities businesses. I'm proud that we were able to support the intermediation and ﬁnancing needs of our clients, all while keeping a keen eye on risk management. In these businesses, we have demonstrated our ability to deliver strong results in a broad array of market environments. W e've consistently grown ﬁnancing and while intermediation activity across various asset classes can ebb and ﬂow in any given quarter , our overall results have been remarkably resilient over time. In Investment banking, the volatile backdrop led to more muted activity relative to the levels we had expected coming into the year , but it is especially in environments like this that clients come to Goldman Sachs for help with their most important strategic decisions. W e are the number one M&A  advisor globally and have been for the last 20 years. We've built our leadership position through decades of investment and our incredible teams in the Americas, Europe and Asia. This allows us to help clients execute marquee transactions like Google's $32 billion acquisition of Wiz, the largest transaction in Israeli history or the $24 billion take private of W algreens Boots Alliance, a ﬁrm with presence across the US, Europe and Latin America. As we stand today , our client dialogues remain elevated and our backlog is up for the fourth consecutive quarter . That being said, our ability to execute on these transactions will, of course, be dependent on market conditions. In Asset & W ealth Management, our clients continue to come to us for the quality of our advice and track record of investing acumen across asset classes, which is especially valued in turbulent markets. This quarter , our assets under supervision rose to a record of $3.2 trillion. This represents our 29th consecutive quarter of long- term fee-based net inﬂows, and we're making strong progress across our key growth opportunities in this business, alternatives, wealth management and solutions. At alternatives, our long track record of performance continues to support our fundraising ef forts. W e raised another $19 billion in the quarter , bringing our total fundraising of alternatives since 2019 to $342 billion. W e also recently launched multiple ﬂagship funds across strategies, including infrastructure, growth equity , and private credit. In Wealth Management, we continue to scale our premier ultra-high net worth franchise. Total W ealth Management revenue grew 1 1% year-over-year to $2.2 billion, while client assets reached another record of $1.6 trillion. Supporting this platform, we have over 1,000 private wealth advisors with an average tenure of more than 15 years. Leveraging the ﬁrm's investment platform, global network and banking capabilities, they work tirelessly to deliver unique and tailored solutions to our ultra- high net worth clients. We recently received a number of accolades from Euromoney , including being named the W orld's Best Private bank for 2025. These awards are a recognition of our excellence and longstanding commitment to serving the needs of our ultra-high net worth client base. Across our businesses, our clear priority is to serve clients with excellence. To that end, we are always seeking ways to enhance the client experience while improving efﬁciency . As highlighted in our strategic update this January , we are investing to strengthen our franchise and operate more ef fectively at scale. This includes taking steps to unlock efﬁciencies in technology and automation. As an example, we are leveraging AI solutions to scale and transform our engineering capabilities as well as to simplify and modernize our technology stack. Today , many of our people have access to Generative AI powered tools to help them serve clients more efﬁciently and increase productivity . These include a developer co-pilot coding assistant and a natural language GS AI assistant. W e continue to believe an acceleration in AI adoption will allow for further efﬁciencies for our own business and for companies large and small. As it is utilized more broadly , productivity gains for the economy will be signiﬁcant. Turning to the macroeconomic backdrop more broadly , as I said at the outset, we are entering the second quarter with a markedly dif ferent operating environment than earlier this year . Our economists' expectation for growth in the US has fallen meaningfully from over 2% to 0.5%. The prospect of a recession has increased with growing indications that economic activity is slowing down around the world. Our clients, including corporate CEOs and institutional investors are concerned by the signiﬁcant near-term and longer-term uncertainty that has constrained their ability to make important decisions. This uncertainty around the path forward and fears over the potentially escalating ef fects of the trade war have created material risks to the US and global economy . We are encouraged by the administration's recent actions to pursue a more gradual policy process that allows for considered negotiations with many countries, but how policies will evolve is still unknown. W e are hopeful that feedback from companies large and small, institutional investors, and ultimately consumers will support an approach that will lead to greater economic certainty and long-term growth. In the meantime, markets will likely continue to be volatile until we have further clarity . The administration's focus on trade barriers and strengthening the US competitive position is commendable. At the same time, it is important to recognize that few companies have beneﬁted more from a post-W orld W ar II economic and ﬁnancial order than the US. This doesn't mean meaningful reform in certain areas is not warranted. Today , the US is the largest, most dynamic and resilient economy with the dollar as a reserve currency . We have the broadest and deepest capital markets, which help fuel an unparalleled culture of innovation in sectors like technology and healthcare. These strengths, among others, give us the opportunity to think about how to attract and embed strategic manufacturing as an important driver of the 21st century economy . As a country , it is vital that we continue to leverage our considerable strengths as the global trading system for goods and services adjusts and evolves. On capital and regulation more broadly , we appreciate the administration's strong focus on appropriately calibrating regulation for the ﬁnancial services industry . Following the recent nomination of Michelle Bowman as V ice-Chairman of Supervision at the Federal Reserve, we will continue to actively engage on these matters and hope to see material progress across capital, leverage, liquidity , and supervision. As this quarter has shown, it's impossible to predict market outcomes, but it has also demonstrated once again that in times of great uncertainty , clients turn to Goldman Sachs for execution and insight, and our leading franchises have never been better positioned to support our clients. I will now turn it over to Denis to cover the ﬁnancial results for the quarter .
 Thank you, David. Good morning. Let's start with our results on Page 1 of the presentation. In the ﬁrst quarter , we generated net revenues of $15.1 billion, earnings per share of $14.12, and an ROE of 16.9%. W e provide details on selected items in the bottom table, which in total reduced our EPS by $0.25 and ROE by 30 basis points. Let's turn to performance by segment, starting on Page 3. Global Banking & Markets produced revenues of $10.7 billion in the ﬁrst quarter and generated an ROE of over 20%. Turning to Page 4, advisory revenues of $792 million were down versus a strong performance a year ago. W e remained number one in the league tables for M&A  with a lead of over $70 billion in announced volumes versus our next closest peer . Equity underwriting revenues of $370 million were ﬂat year-over-year , while debt underwriting revenues of $752 million rose 8%, driven by asset-backed and investment-grade activity . We ranked ﬁrst in equity & equity-related underwriting and ranked second in both high yield debt underwriting and leverage lending. Across Investment banking, our backlog rose sequentially , driven by a notable increase in advisory . FICC net revenues were $4.4 billion in the quarter . Intermediation results were driven by higher client activity in currencies and mortgages, of fset by lower performance in credit, rates and commodities versus a strong prior year . We produced record FICC ﬁnancing revenues of $1 billion, driven by solid performance in mortgages and structured lending. W e remain conﬁdent in our ability to prudently grow this business over time and always with an eye towards risk management. Equities net revenues were a record $4.2 billion in the quarter . Equities intermediation revenues of $2.5 billion rose 28% year-over-year , primarily driven by strong performance in derivatives. Record equities ﬁnancing revenues of $1.6 billion were higher year-over-year on better portfolio ﬁnancing results and record average prime balances for the quarter . Across FICC and equities, ﬁnancing revenues of $2.7 billion rose 22% versus the prior year , reaching a new record for a ﬁfth consecutive quarter . Let's turn to Page 5. Asset & W ealth Management revenues were $3.7 billion. Management and other fees were up 10% year-over-year to $2.7 billion on higher average assets under supervision and down slightly versus the fourth quarter , driven by other fees, which include placement fees that can vary from quarter to quarter . Incentive fees were $129 million, up year-over-year despite the difﬁcult monetization environment during the quarter . We expect to make progress on our target of $1 billion in annual incentive fees over the medium term, supported by an estimated $4.1 billion of unrecognized incentive fees as of year-end. Private banking and lending revenues were $725 million, up 6% year-over-year on higher lending revenues. Sequentially , results were roughly ﬂat as NIM compression on deposits was of fset by lending revenue growth. In aggregate, our more durable revenues of $3.4 billion across Management and other fees and Private banking and lending grew 9% versus the prior year . We continue to expect high single-digit annual growth in these lines over time. Revenues from equity investments and debt investments totaled $122 million, largely driven by net interest income in our debt portfolio. Within equity investments, net gains in our private portfolio were more than of fset by declines in our public portfolio amid the more challenging market backdrop during the quarter . In the AWM segment, we generated 21% pre-tax margin and roughly 10% ROE. Excluding the impact of historical principal investments and approximately $4 billion of attributed equity , our pre-tax margin would have been 2 percentage points higher and ROE 2.6 percentage points higher . Now moving to Page 6. Total assets under supervision ended the quarter at a record $3.2 trillion. W e had $29 billion of long-term net inﬂows across asset classes, representing our 29th consecutive quarter of long-term fee-based net inﬂows. Turning to Page 7 on alternatives. Alternative assets under supervision totaled $341 billion at the end of the ﬁrst quarter , driving $523 million in Management and Other fees. Gross third-party alternatives fundraising was $19 billion in the quarter . We continue to expect fundraising to be in line with recent years, though this outlook could be impacted by market conditions. On Page 9, ﬁrm-wide net interest income was $2.9 billion in the ﬁrst quarter , up sequentially on a decline in funding costs. Our total loan portfolio at quarter-end was $210 billion, up versus the fourth quarter , primarily reﬂecting an increase in other collateralized lending. Our provision for credit losses of $287 million, primarily reﬂects net provisions related to the credit card portfolio, which were driven by net charge-of fs, partially of fset by releases following a seasonal paydown of card balances. Turning to expenses on Page 10. Total quarterly operating expenses were $9.1 billion, resulting in an efﬁciency ratio of 60.6%. Our compensation ratio net of provisions, was 33%. Non-compensation expenses were $4.3 billion. David mentioned, we continue to execute on our three-year efﬁciency plan that we laid out in January , including making adjustments to our pyramid structure. Our ef fective tax rate for the quarter of 16.1% beneﬁted from the impact of employee stock-based compensation. Excluding this impact, our ef fective tax rate would have been roughly 9 points higher . For the full year , we expect a tax rate of approximately 21%. Now on to Slide 1 1. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 14.8% at the end of the ﬁrst quarter under the standardized approach, 1 10 basis points above our current capital requirement of 13.7%. In the quarter , we returned $5.3 billion to common shareholders, including record common stock repurchases of $4.4 billion and common stock dividends of $976 million. W e will dynamically deploy capital to support our client franchise while also returning capital to shareholders. W e remain committed to paying our shareholders a sustainable and growing dividend. Importantly , our Board recently authorized a multi-year share repurchase program of up to $40 billion, providing us increased capital management ﬂexibility . In conclusion, our performance once again reﬂects the diversiﬁcation and strength of our leading client franchises, which enable us to deliver for our clients across a range of market backdrops. W e are conﬁdent in our ability to continue to support our clients as they navigate this dynamic operating environment. With that, we will now open up the line for questions.","In the ﬁrst quarter , we generated net revenues of $15.1 billion, earnings per share of $14.12, an ROE of 16.9% and an ROTE of 18%.
