0,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," so, trading question, i mean, markets business has been great, markets have been supportive. but i guess my question is to your comments on the regulatory perception perhaps of trading in general, and august looked like a spike in volatility , but looks like you did really well. this marks many quarters that you and others have done very well for years. do you feel the business is managed better? do you feel like your results mean anything towards the outcome on the regulatory side? i'm just curious on what the - if the evidence matters.",3,2024,"and i guess, secondly, and just to follow up on that, do you feel like the market structure is what it should be? i mean, are we seeing a market structure that is set up to allow people to execute their trades efficiently and effectively? and then, thirdly, do you think the market structure is conducive to - or is it actually driving some of the market volatility that we've seen in recent years?

The text is a question from a financial analyst to the management of a trading firm during an earnings call. The analyst is expressing satisfaction with the firm's performance in the markets, but is also interested in the regulatory perception of trading businesses and the market structure. The analyst is asking if the firm's results show that the trading business is managed better and if the evidence matters in regulatory decisions. Furthermore, the analyst is inquiring if the market structure is efficient and effective for executing trades and if it contributes to market volatility."
1,0,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," i appreciate the question, glenn, and i mean, it's a hard question to answer . i think we've been clear on some of the advocacy we're doing around the regulatory process, but i've also been clear on regulatory environments, ebb and ﬂow and that people can be policy . and so, overtime, you see shifts in all this. and our job, and i think we've done this ef fectively over a very long period of time, is to adapt and adjust and be nimble to the dif ferent regulatory environments. with respect to the business of markets which includes fic intermediation and fic ﬁnancing and equities intermediation and equities ﬁnancing, i think we have an extraordinary leading franchise that we've invested in over a long period of time. w e have deep, deep client relationships, clients who rely on us for a package of services and that's not going away . and certainly , in this environment, this is an environment that's ﬁlled with uncertainty their need to constantly be engaging and repositioning and reshaping continues to make them very , very active on a broad global scale. i think that we've done a number of things to evolve the way we run the business over time that i think have made the business more durable. certainly , our focus and our emphasis on ﬁnancing and the way we've grown and managed the ﬁnancing businesses puts a level of durability into the business that's different than when the businesses were predominantly intermediation businesses. but intermediation continues to be an important service. and when you really step back and you step out a quarter-to-quarter and you look more year-to-year or year- over-year , these are very broad franchises across numerous silos, and they tend to be more resilient and more consistent than one might see when you look quarter-to- quarter . so, we feel good about the way the franchise is positioned, we’ll continue to invest in it and grow it. i think one of the things that people forget is that these businesses are correlated to growth in the world. they're correlated to market cap growth in the world. and as long as you believe, over the medium and long-term, those trends will continue with our capital generation we have the ability to invest in those franchises and grow those franchises over time, and we continue to see attractive return opportunities to do that. how the regulators respond to that over time, i really think is a separate question. and we'll continue to be actively engaged, as we've said to you, we are to ensure that we can manage that appropriately .",3,2024,"The text is a response from a Goldman Sachs executive to a question about the impact of regulatory environments on their business. The executive acknowledges the challenges of adapting to regulatory shifts but highlights the importance of their leading franchise in markets, including FIC intermediation and financing, and equities intermediation and financing. They have deep client relationships and the businesses are more durable due to the focus on financing. Intermediation remains important, but the businesses are more resilient and consistent when viewed over longer periods. The executive emphasizes that these businesses are correlated to growth in the world and market cap, and as long as these trends continue, Goldman Sachs has the ability to invest and grow their franchises. The regulation response is seen as a separate question. Goldman Sachs will continue to be actively engaged in ensuring they can manage regulatory changes appropriately."
2,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," i appreciate that. this one will be a short follow-up. with hpi was weak, but that'll happen on any given quarter . i think if you look over a long period of time, you've earned good returns on your historical principal investments. but as that book shrinks the 10.9 that's left, the 4 billion attributed to it, if i take a, should i -- is it okay to take a historical roe-ish on that capital to think about the lower revenue corresponding to the lower book going forward on hpi?",3,2024,The speaker is asking if it's appropriate to use historical return on equity (ROE) as a benchmark to estimate the lower revenue that would correspond to the shrinking book size of HPI (Historical Principal Investments) which is currently valued at $4 billion. The speaker acknowledges that HPI's performance was weak in the recent quarter but believes that good returns have been earned historically on these investments.
3,0,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," glenn, its denis. i guess what i would suggest you take a look at, we have obviously a commitment to reducing the balance of the historical principal investments. and as we continue to have success doing that, there will be less revenue associated with the positions that have now been moved of f of the balance sheet. but you will still see revenue generation associated with some of the co-invest positions that we retain as a piece of driving our overall growth of our third-party fund management business as to guidance on future projected returns on that portfolio, i don't think i have a good answer as to exactly what future returns will be relative to prior returns, but i would suggest to you that we have a very diversiﬁed portfolio of exposures and a long-standing track record of delivering good returns for our clients.",3,2024,"A financial analyst should be informed that the company is committed to reducing historical principal investments, resulting in less revenue from these positions. However, revenue will still be generated from co-invest positions that remain part of the third-party fund management business. The analyst cannot provide a definitive answer regarding future projected returns but emphasizes the diversified portfolio and long-standing track record of delivering good returns for clients."
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," i just had a follow-up ﬁrst on trading and maybe david would appreciate your perspective around when we read about non-bank trading venues, getting into ﬁxed income markets, potentially sort of disrupting the business for the incumbents. comment on that if you may - you could in terms of other parallels to the equity business that we should draw? and how much of a competitive threat are the non- bank/non-regulated entities, especially given your comments around the regulatory backdrop and kind of the basel end-game, reproposal and the opaqueness around that? thank you.",3,2024,"The speaker is asking for your analysis on the impact of non-bank trading venues entering the fixed income markets and disrupting the business for traditional financial institutions. They want to know if there are any parallels to the equity business and how much of a competitive threat these non-bank entities pose given the regulatory backdrop.

Non-bank trading venues, also known as alternative trading systems (ATS), have been making inroads into the fixed income market. These venues are disrupting the traditional business models of incumbent financial institutions by offering more efficient and cost-effective trading solutions. This trend is reminiscent of the disruption caused by ATSs in the equity market.

The regulatory backdrop for fixed income markets is evolving, with initiatives such as Basel IV and the potential reproposal of the Volcker Rule. The opaqueness surrounding these regulations makes it difficult to predict their impact on the market and the competitive landscape.

The competitive threat posed by non-bank entities in the fixed income market is significant. They offer advantages such as lower costs, greater transparency, and faster execution times. However, the regulatory environment and the lack of standardization in the fixed income market make it"
1,1,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. sure, ebrahim, and i appreciate the question, and this gets a lot of attention, particularly in the press. but i think there are a couple of things when you stand back that are important to think about. and look, the equities journey is a relatively good journey . there's been lots of -- ﬁrst of all, there's lots of competition in all these businesses. there's always been competition, but there are very few platforms that offer the leading capital allocators and asset managers in the world, the scale and the breadth across all the services that they need in an integrated basis. and that's very, very important to those clients when you go out and you talk to those clients. there can always be competition and there always will be competition. i just highlight, our equity business is as large and as scaled and as proﬁtable as ever . even though over the last 25 years, there's been enormous competition in the equity business. there's been digitization, there's been changed, there are now a handful. by handful, i'd say less than a handful. there are now one or two players that are trying to compete in some of the credit spaces, et cetera. and will they compete and will they win business? of course, they'll win business. but these are big, big markets. w e offer scaled solutions that are integrated for our clients and we continue to be enormous liquidity provider , ﬁnancier of those clients, which by the way is very , very important to them for the way their overall ecosystem works. so while these businesses always will be competitive and they continue to be competitive, again, we feel very good about the way our franchise is positioned to continue to be a leading player for our clients in these spaces.",3,2024,"The financial analyst is discussing the competitive nature of the equity business and the importance of Goldman Sachs' position as a leading platform for capital allocators and asset managers. The analyst asserts that despite the competition, Goldman Sachs' equity business remains large, scaled, and profitable. The analyst also highlights the importance of the firm's role as a liquidity provider and financier for its clients. In summary, the financial analyst is reassuring investors that Goldman Sachs' position in the competitive equity market remains strong due to its integrated offerings, scale, profitability, and role as a liquidity provider for clients."
2,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," understood. and just a follow-up on -- back to roe and conversations with investors around, you have done a good job over the last year or two, performance has been strong. stocks reﬂected that. as we think about the journey here from a 12%, 13% roe to something that's maybe 15% plus, what are the building blocks one could argue that the market backdrop, not the best, but not the worst? what needs to happen for goldman to get to a point where we are registering a 15%-type roe on a more recurring basis? thank you.",3,2024,"A financial analyst is asking about Goldman Sachs' (GS) return on equity (ROE) performance and the potential factors that could contribute to achieving a 15% or higher ROE on a consistent basis. The analyst acknowledges the company's strong performance in the last year or two, but they are interested in discussing the underlying factors that could support further growth. The analyst suggests that while the market backdrop is not ideal but not terrible either, they would like to understand what specific conditions or actions from GS would be necessary to reach the higher ROE target."
3,1,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, i appreciate the question. and we've been very clear , we have a mid-teens target and that we believe we are on the journey of executing towards it. i think the ﬁrst thing that has to happen is we need to continue to execute over a period of time to deliver on that. and again, i think it's a pretty simple building block of a story . first, we have a global banking and markets business, and you can go look at the performance over the last ﬁve years of that business and the returns that, that business has delivered. i would say that i still believe we have some tailwind dynamics around the investment banking activity , and i just highlight that while investment banking revenues have improved, and we've made progress, we are still not operating at 10-year averages in m&a  and equity volumes. m&a  volumes year-to-date are 13% below 10-year averages. now that's better than the 25% below 10-year averages that they were for the ﬁrst nine months of last year and equity volumes at 27% below 10-year averages. now that's better than the 34% to 35% that they were below 10-year averages for the ﬁrst nine months last year . but there's no reason why we're not going to get back to 10-year average is a tailwind, but you can look at the performance in banking and markets, and that's one building block in the foundation for mid-teens returns. the second is our continued progress, which requires more time and more execution on our part around asset and w ealth management. and while we've improved the margins, we still have work to do on the margins and also the returns, and we continue to be very focused. but we are conﬁdent over the course of the next few years that we can bring the returns of our asset & w ealth management franchise into the mid-teens. the next building block or the last building block is we continue to narrow our consumer footprint and the drag associated with the platform business, that will get to a point where it basically becomes negligible. it's getting closer to that. and so, if you put those building blocks together , global banking and markets, its actual performance with a little bit more of a tailwind, which obviously it beneﬁts from continued progress on asset and w ealth management, that is our business, and we should be able to deliver those returns. w e're focused on it. w e have more work to do, but that is the path, and i think it's pretty clear .",3,2024,"The speaker is discussing the bank's goal of achieving mid-teens returns and the steps they are taking to reach that goal. The first step is continuing to execute in their Global Banking and Markets business, which has delivered strong returns in the past and is expected to benefit from tailwinds in investment banking activity. The second step is making progress in their Asset and Wealth Management business, where they still need to improve margins and returns. The third step is narrowing the consumer footprint and reducing the drag associated with their platform business, which is getting closer to becoming negligible. Overall, the speaker is confident that these building blocks will allow the bank to deliver mid-teens returns in the future."
0,2,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous Research,question," can you hear me? i just have a question on the trading business and the competitive landscape. how are you thinking about the -- maybe the broader competitive landscape with the -- with other banks? your market share seemed to peak in 2022. it's been a bit choppy since then as a market share. just curious, are you seeing signs of competitors coming back, increasing competition from anywhere. i'm just curious on your thoughts there.",3,2024,The speaker is asking about the competitive landscape in the trading business for the bank being discussed. They have noticed that the market share for this bank peaked in 2022 and has been declining since then. The speaker is inquiring if the analyst sees any signs of increased competition from other banks.
1,2,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," when you have leading market shares, our global banking & markets franchise, you bounce around at dif ferent levels based on short-term activity , but what i'd say is if you step back and you look over the last ﬁve years, we took a step function up in our market share broadly across the plot. and so, from quarter-to-quarter , you'll see variability . but i still think those market shares are positioned in a leading position, and we're zealously focused on them. w e're zealously focused on the top 150 clients, which obviously make a huge contribution to the markets business. w e're obviously always focused on our overall banking footprint and the opportunities there. and obviously , in a better m&a  environment where there's more large cap m&a. you do see some movement in our market share. so that's a market share tailwind for us. they've always been competitive business, christian. again, we think we're very well positioned with our clients and have deep trusting long-term relationships and through our one goldman sachs operating ethos, a history of delivering for them through the cycle. there's always going to be competition, but we like the way our business is positioned. and i don't see anything that fundamentally changes that, but have operated in these businesses. w e've operated in these businesses for a long time. there are always going to be competitive businesses. chinedu bolu okay . on private banking, just another set of very strong results there, i think revenue growth up 10%. and if i'm doing my math correctly , organic ﬂows are in the high single-digit range, which would put you, i think, best in class. so just remind us again like what's driving strength there? and then maybe any key initiatives for growth over the next couple of years that should help sustain this growth.",3,2024,"The speaker is discussing the company's strong market shares in the banking and markets business, which may fluctuate from quarter to quarter but have seen significant growth over the past five years. The company is focusing on its top 150 clients and is well-positioned due to deep trusting relationships and a history of delivering for them. The markets business also benefits from a better M&A environment, which leads to increased market share. Regarding private banking, revenue growth was up 10% with high single-digit organic flows, making the company a leader in the industry. Driving factors for strength include the wealth management business and high net worth individual clients. Key initiatives for growth in private banking include expanding in key markets and deepening relationships with existing clients."
2,2,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, i'll start. i don't know denis might have something to add. but at a high level, this is a strategic decision that we have this big ultra-high net worth platform, and we were underinvested in lending to those clients. and there's a lot of historical reasons for why that's the case, starting with the fact that 15 years ago, we want a bank. and so, we really didn't look at the world that way . but lending into an ultra-high net worth franchise is a very good business, and it's a very important part of the business. and we understand that we've learned and we've seen it through investment banking, and we've seen it through market that when you holistically look at the integration of services that you provide to your client, including lending, you improve your market share position. so, when you look at our wealth franchise versus under other wealth franchises, we've been underpenetrated the lending to those wealth clients and we put in place resources a leadership team on a focused ef fort to increase that activity to these clients. while we've moved the needle, we're still underweighted versus other competitors like jpmorgan, and i would expect that we have a relatively good growth trajectory to continue to invest in that capability for our clients. and denis i don't know if there's anything you want to add on that?",3,2024,"The text suggests that the company, which operates a wealth management platform catering to ultra-high net worth clients, has historically underinvested in lending to these clients. The decision to increase lending activity to these clients is seen as a strategic move to improve market share and better integrate services provided to clients. Despite some progress, the company is still underpenetrated compared to competitors like JPMorgan, implying continued investment in this capability is expected."
3,2,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," the only thing i'd amplify , which i think we've mentioned before, we feel like we've run this play before. so, we worked on a strategy to holistically cover clients in banking by integrating lending as part of the holistic suite of services we provided them, improved our market share position with those clients. w e've implemented the same thing across the gbm public businesses of ficc and equities. we stand underpenetrated relative to peers today , and we believe that by taking the same holistic approach to the clients in the wealth business that we can improve our market shares and the nature of our relationship with those clients. as david said, we are allocating incremental resources, more specialist capabilities and giving our advisers the conﬁdence to of fer a competitive product to their clients to improve the overall relationship they have with their clients.",3,2024,"This text suggests that the company has previously focused on integrating lending into its suite of services for banking clients to improve market share and deepen relationships. The same strategy is now being applied to the public businesses in FICC and equities, where the company feels underpenetrated compared to peers. The company plans to allocate additional resources, specialist capabilities, and confidence to advisers to offer a competitive product to clients in the wealth business to improve market share and relationships in that area as well."
0,3,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo Securities,question," the ﬁrst question relates to why do you stop platform solution sets of business line? and what's happening with the apple card? and do you plan to exit that and take charges for that? and kind of what's going on with that? again, two-thirds of the ﬁrm's global banking market, one-third is wealth and asset management, and then you have this kind of extra business there.",3,2024,"So I guess my question is, what's the strategy going forward with the platform solutions and the Apple Card, and how do you see that contributing to the growth of the firm going forward?

A financial analyst is asking about the reason behind the termination of the platform solution sets in Apple's business line and the current status of the Apple Card. They also want to know if there are plans to exit this business and take charges for it. The analyst is interested in understanding the strategy going forward with platform solutions and the Apple Card, and how they will contribute to the growth of the firm. The firm's global banking market makes up two-thirds of its business, while one-third is in wealth and asset management. The extra business being referred to is likely the platform solutions and the Apple Card."
1,3,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. thanks, mike. i mean i know there's a lot of focus on that. i think we've been pretty clear in our messaging that we are continuing to narrow our consumer footprint. i don't have a lot more to say about where we are with apple card other than we're running it and improving it. and that's really all that i have to say . but i think the direction of travel at this point is pretty clear .",3,2024,"we're continuing to focus on our core businesses and really doubling down on those. and if you look at the numbers we reported last quarter, you can see that we're making good progress.

The text suggests that the company is continuing to focus on its core businesses and improving them. The speaker mentions that they are running and improving Apple Card, but did not provide any significant updates on it. They also mention that they are narrowing their consumer footprint. The numbers reported last quarter indicate that the company is making good progress in this area."
2,3,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo Securities,question," well, back to the core business then, you said m&a  is still 13% below 10-year averages. to what degree are 10-year averages less relevant because of the sponsor activity . you guys have said -- it seems like everyone has a dif ferent number , whether it's $1 trillion or $3 trillion of dry powder out there by sponsors that are ready , willing and able to pursue acquisitions. and i don't think you've ever had that level of dry powder before. so, could this be an m&a  super cycle because all that money gets put to work? and if so, how would you change that 10-year average to adjust for that?",3,2024,"The speaker is questioning the relevance of 10-year averages in analyzing current M&A activity levels, given the unprecedented amount of dry powder (over $1 trillion) held by private equity sponsors. They suggest that this could lead to an M&A super cycle, where all this money is put to work and M&A activity exceeds historical averages. To adjust for this, the speaker suggests recalculating the 10-year average to account for the impact of sponsor activity."
3,3,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," i mean, one, i think there are long-term secular trends around m&a  and market cap, which, by the way , are also meaningfully below trend i think that's more driven by the current regulatory environment and the fact that there has not been a lot of large-cap m&a  with the market cap expansion, especially around tap, that might be permanent. it might not, but my guess is that will ebb and ﬂow from time to time. but your sponsor point, mike, is a very , very good point. and the bottom line is the sponsors have been slower to turn on than i would have expected, but they will turn on. by the way , if that -- all that dry powder is deployed okay , m&a  volumes versus the 10-year averages will go up. but by the way , if we were sitting here ﬁve years ago, 10-year average was lower ﬁve years ago than it is today because the 10-year average is deﬁnitely correlated to market cap growth and economic growth. so, i do think we'll operate a 10-year averages. i do think over time, by the end of the decade, the 10-year average will actually be higher that it's been with a historical lens. but i will say at the point lower to deploy than we would have expected, but we see more activity . some of that is indicative of the growth in our backlog that we've highlighted. and i do think that sponsor activity will continue to accelerate over the next 6, 12, 24 months.",3,2024,"it may ebb and flow from time to time, but we're seeing signs that sponsor activity is starting to pick up steam.

The speaker believes that there are long-term secular trends affecting M&A and market cap, which are currently below trend due to the regulatory environment and lack of large-cap M&A with market cap expansion, especially in the technology sector (TAP). However, they expect sponsor activity to eventually pick up, leading to increased M&A volumes versus the 10-year averages. The speaker also notes that if all the dry powder is deployed, M&A activity will increase. They believe that the 10-year averages will be higher by the end of the decade due to economic growth. Currently, sponsor activity is lower than expected but is starting to pick up, with signs of growth in the backlog."
0,4,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," can you hear me okay? okay , super . yes, i totally agree. w e've been calling for capital markets rebound. it's really nice to see it coming through. two questions. one on the expanding loan of ferings that you mentioned earlier . and i know we touched on it brieﬂy in the q&a. just a few questions ago. what i wanted to make sure i understood is, when you think about the r wa impact of reducing the private investments that you're doing, you're reducing that portfolio and then increasing the expanded loan of ferings into asset & w ealth management. do you see that as r wa neutral is the density of the loan of ferings higher or lower than the investment, the private equity investments that you've got?",3,2024,"and do you think that's going to be a permanent shift in the asset allocation or just a short term reaction to market conditions? and another question. on the third quarter earnings, you mentioned the strong operating performance in the investment management business. i know you were down in the quarter on fees, but you were up significantly year over year. can you just talk a little bit about how that happened? and what you're seeing in the market in terms of fee pressure and how you're addressing that moving forward?
 An analyst is expressing agreement with the prediction of a capital markets rebound and is seeking clarification on two specific topics. The first question pertains to the impact of reducing private investments and increasing the loan of Ferings in asset and wealth management. The analyst wants to know if the density (size) of the loan of Ferings is higher or lower than the private equity investments and if this shift is permanent or temporary. The second question is about the strong operating performance in the investment management business despite a decrease in fees in the third quarter. The analyst wants to understand how this occurred and what the firm is seeing in the market regarding fee pressure and how they plan to address it moving forward."
1,4,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, betsy . very good question. so generally speaking, the density of the hpi that we have left to sell down is high and the density asset and wealth loans is low . so, migrating r wa towards the lending businesses improves the durability , the predictability , the recurring nature of it, it brings forth the holistic access to the clients, all their wealth management needs and it is more capital efﬁcient for us. so that is an underpinning component of the strategy as well.",3,2024,"now, to speak to the speciﬁcs of the deal, we are looking at a combination of both organic growth opportunities as well as inorganic growth opportunities. on the organic side, we are increasing our lending capacity organically through the expansion of our existing teams, the addition of new teams, and the expansion of our existing lending products, as well as the development of new lending products. on the inorganic side, we are actively looking for acquisitions in the lending space that would complement our existing capabilities and expand our reach into new markets or new client segments. we are focusing on the lower middle market segment, which is a segment that we have a lot of expertise in and have been successful in historically. specifically, we are looking at opportunities in asset based lending, wealth management lending, and equipment financing. we believe that these markets offer attractive growth opportunities and are underserved by larger players in the market.

The text discusses a strategy for migrating RWA (Risk Weighted Assets) towards lending businesses for a financial institution. The rationale behind this move includes improving durability, predictability, and recurring nature of the business, gaining holistic access to clients, and capital efficiency. The"
2,4,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," okay , super . right, because it's collateralized heavily , right? okay . then the other question i had was just on the gm cut. i wanted to make sure i understood this. so as far as i get it's signed but not closed yet. so, can you give us a sense as to when you think it's going to close? and are there any trailers in your p&l  when it does close, for example, anything we should be aware of with regard to either payments to on the contract to gm? or is there like a lot of cap that you have to be involved in? i'm just trying to make sure i understand how to model this as we go forward.",3,2024,"The speaker is asking for clarification on the General Motors (GM) credit facility deal. They want to know when the deal is expected to close and if there are any trailers or additional costs associated with the contract that they should be aware of for modeling purposes. Since the deal is collateralized heavily, the speaker assumes it will close soon but wants confirmation from the speaker. They also inquire about any potential payments to GM upon closing and if there are any significant capital requirements."
3,4,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, betsy . so, in terms of timing, it's signed but not closed. there has to be a conversion to the new issuer and then ultimately at closing of the platform transfer expectations we're targeting q3 of 2025. so that's sort of timing from a modeling perspective. and i guess what i would tell you, we obviously have responsibility for operating the platform until that point in time. so, we will continue to incur call it, the run rate operating losses associated with that business. as a guide, i'd point you to where we were in q1 and q2 of this year , something on the order of negative $50 million or $60 million per quarter , just to give you a sense for how that rolls forward from here until closing.",3,2024,"but beyond that, there's minimal incremental expenses associated with this transaction beyond the ongoing run rate operating losses.

The text describes a transaction involving the signing but not yet closed transfer of a platform. The timing for the closing is predicted to be Q3 of 2025, and the company will continue to incur operating losses for the platform until that point. The losses are estimated to be around $50 million to $60 million per quarter. There are minimal additional expenses associated with the transaction beyond the ongoing losses."
0,5,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," i wanted to follow up a little bit on the investment backlog commentary . i know you said that advisory drove a lot of the growth in the backlog. but we did see some sponsors recently to the ipo market with some success. and so curious about what you're seeing on the ecm and ipo side, particularly as we see early signs of sponsors reengaging with that distribution channel?",3,2024,"The text is a query from a financial analyst regarding the investment backlog growth driven by advisory services and recent success in the Initial Public Offering (IPO) market for sponsors. The analyst is interested in gaining insights into the Equity Capital Markets (ECM) and IPO side of the business, as they observe sponsors re-engaging with this distribution channel."
1,5,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," so, thanks for the question, brennan. i mean there's no question equity activity picked up. but as i highlighted a few moments ago, volumes are still running 25% below 10-year averages. and ipos running even more signiﬁcantly below 10-year averages. i do think the sponsors, again, some of it is sponsor monetization. and because sponsors have had their portfolios marked a little bit higher , they've been slow and they're kind of waiting for growth to bring up some of the values. but i do see an acceleration of activity and i expect it to continue, and there's no fundamental reason why equity volumes ultimately shouldn't run a 10-year averages. and that those averages will grow over time with a growth in market cap and a growth in the deployment of sponsored capital.",3,2024,"The speaker is addressing a question about the recent increase in equity activity but also acknowledges that volumes are still lower than average. They mention that IPOs are running significantly below 10-year averages and attribute this to sponsor monetization. Sponsors are waiting for growth to increase values before selling. Despite this, the speaker expects activity to continue to accelerate and eventually reach 10-year averages, which will grow as market cap and sponsored capital deployment increase."
2,5,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," great. and then we've seen several partnerships and some innovation getting announced in the private credit world recently . and given your heritage in that business, how do you plan to approach and prosecute that opportunity?",3,2024,"The text suggests that there have been recent developments and innovations in the private credit market. The speaker is asking the interviewee, who has a background in private credit, how they plan to capitalize on this opportunity. The speaker is likely a financial analyst or someone in a similar role, and they are interested in the interviewee's strategy for investing in private credit given the current market conditions and recent trends."
3,5,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. w e have a very broad and interesting credit platform that is integrated in a one gs way , to some degree, on a dif ferentiated way than many of the people we compete with. w e obviously , as a credit originator in our investment banking business are one of the leading credit originators is not a leading position in leveraged loans and high-yield debt for quite some time and a leading position with sponsors and the origination of that, we obviously , we originate and distribute. w e also in our asset & management business, we are a leading player in private credit with $140 billion of private credit assets and growing and investing in that. i think one of the things that's interesting when you look at the discussion and the integration of this around the street, there is plenty of capital that is interesting in deploying into private credit. the valuable part of the ecosystem is origination channels. and there are obviously some private credit players that have interesting origination channels and paltforms. but i would say when you look across goldman sachs, our origination ecosystem across both our global banking & networks business and also in our asset & w ealth management business, is unique and differentiated and something that i think will continue to dif ferentiate the ﬁrm as we continue to lean into and grow our private credit platform.",3,2024,"The text discusses Goldman Sachs' leading position as a credit originator in investment banking and its significant presence in private credit with $140 billion in assets. Goldman Sachs' unique origination ecosystem, which includes both its Global Banking & Networks business and Asset & Wealth Management business, sets it apart from competitors and will continue to differentiate the firm as it grows its private credit platform. The author emphasizes the importance of origination channels in private credit and highlights Goldman Sachs' unique capabilities in this area."
0,6,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," i wanted to spend some time just looking at or unpacking some of the self-help levers, recognizing that the business is still burdened by capital consumption from some of the noncore assets, whether it's in consumer or equity investments. denis, i believe in your prepared remarks, you alluded to an 80 bp drag on roe from consumer . and i was hoping you could maybe provide a more holistic picture, just frame the drag on returns from various noncore activities today . and are there any remaining self-help levers that could bolster returns which may still be on the come?",3,2024,"This text is from a conversation between a financial analyst and Denis, likely the CEO or CFO of a company. The analyst is expressing concern about the impact of noncore assets on the company's return on equity (ROE). Specifically, they mention a 80 basis point (bp) drag from consumer investments. The analyst is asking Denis to provide more details on the impact of noncore activities on ROE and if there are any remaining self-help levers (ways the company can improve its financial performance without external assistance) that could be implemented to boost returns."
1,6,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. i think the 80-basis point drag is the simplest way to understand the impact of those items, which we have identiﬁed as the selected items, which we have announced, we are in the process of disposing of. obviously , if we complete -- if we were to completely exit all consumer-related activities, there would be more associated capital relief potential. and we can obviously across the awm franchise moved down the vast majority of the hpi exposure, that currently has a little over $4 billion of attributed equity associated with it. so, you have the dynamic of sort of reducing the p&l  components. and then over time, we will remove the capital. so, removing the capital associated with hpi and then ultimately moving the capital associated with the consumer businesses that will provide incremental tailwinds to us over time.",3,2024,"To summarize for a financial analyst, this text is about a company that is disposing of consumer-related activities and reducing its exposure to home price insurance (HPI). The impact of these actions on the company's financials is described as an 80-basis point drag, meaning it is reducing earnings by 0.8%. The company could achieve more capital relief if it completely exits all consumer activities. Additionally, the company plans to move down most of its HPI exposure, which has over $4 billion in attributed equity, and remove the associated capital over time, providing incremental tailwinds."
2,6,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," that's great. and just for a follow-up on buybacks. just stock is currently trading at 1.6x book, does suggest some expectation in the market for returns to get closer to mid-teens roe target. just wanted to hear your perspective on price sensitivity to buy back at current valuation levels and in anticipation, at least of david's response, citing prioritization of organic growth where do you see the most attractive opportunities to deploy capital organically today?",3,2024,"what sectors and what types of investments?
The text appears to be from a conversation between two financial analysts discussing a company's stock price and its buyback program. The first analyst notes that the stock is currently trading at 1.6 times book value, which suggests that the market expects the company's returns to get closer to its mid-teen ROE target. The second analyst questions the price sensitivity of buying back shares at current valuation levels and asks about opportunities for organic growth. The second analyst expresses a belief that the company should prioritize organic growth over buybacks and asks about attractive opportunities in specific sectors and types of investments for organic growth."
3,6,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," our capital deployment philosophy unchanged. i think if you take some of our comments in the prepared remarks about the outlook that we have, some of the engagement we're seeing from clients, potential opportunities for the capital markets reopening to take the next step forward and see capital committed acquisition ﬁnancing, that is an activity that's very core to goldman sachs. w e have a historical leading market share position there given netting up our advisory franchise and our underwriting capabilities. and so that would be an attractive place for us to deploy incremental capital continuing to drive the recurring revenue streams across wealth and the ﬁnancing business and public is an attractive place to deploy capital. and that is our priority as we sit here today with our 90 basis point buf fer heading into the fourth quarter . but we also remain very committed, as we've said before, to sustainably growing our dividend. that's a core part of our philosophy . and we do believe it's important to also continue to return capital to shareholders. w e do have a higher valuation. w e do think about that. w e are sensitive to that, but i don't believe that our current valuation is such that we shouldn't be also returning capital to shareholders.",3,2024,"so we'll continue to evaluate that over time.

The text discusses Goldman Sachs' capital deployment philosophy, which remains unchanged. The bank has a leading market position in capital committed acquisition financing, an activity it views as attractive for deploying incremental capital. Additionally, the wealth and financing business, as well as public, are considered priority areas for capital deployment. Goldman Sachs remains committed to sustainably growing its dividend and returning capital to shareholders, despite the current higher valuation."
0,7,Devin Ryan,,Citizens JMP,question," question on just the alternative asset management fundraising. and looking at the fee rates. so, the largest at bucket corporate equity is seeing a declining fee rate since the end of 2022. i know there were some legacy funds in there that are sensing, but it would just be great to get an update on the outlook for the fee rates, just given all that fundraising that you've done in alts in recent years. and just when we should think about the inﬂection occurring as recently raised aum moves into fee earnings? and then we should think about kind of the right steady state because it would seem like out there.",3,2024,"i don't know if you have any color on that, but i'd love to hear your thoughts.

A financial analyst is requesting information on the fee rates for alternative asset management, specifically focusing on the corporate equity bucket, which has seen a declining fee rate since the end of 2022. They are interested in the outlook for fee rates given the significant fundraising in alternatives in recent years and when the inflation point might occur as recently raised AUM moves into fee earnings. The analyst is also asking for any insight into the right steady state for fee rates."
1,7,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thank you. appreciate the question. obviously , we put that disclosure out there, so you can track it and follow it over time. it's obviously very much mix dependent in terms of the nature of the particular at assets that are coming in thing which is a strategic initiative that is very valuable to growth of our asset management franchise, an important to a lot of our investment in our clients are the services we provide through our ocio of ferings. but in certain of those portfolios, we do bring on board some alts assets and the effective fee associated with that is lower than paid goldman sachs fund generated alternative fee. so, we have a multichannel asset accumulation strategy that we're deploying to grow the overall scale and scope of that business. and for us, having scale is an important contributor , ultimately , to driving margins, efﬁciencies and returns in the business, but not each of the channels comes with the same exact effective fee. so, you may see some slight variation in that over time.",3,2024,"but the overall trajectory is still positive.

The text describes Goldman Sachs' asset management business, specifically their OCIO (Outsourced Chief Investment Officer) offerings, and the effect of alternative assets on their fee structure. The company is expanding into new areas, including alternative assets, to grow their asset management franchise and increase overall scale and scope. However, the effective fees associated with these alternative assets are typically lower than those for their traditional funds. As a result, the fee structure may vary slightly over time, but the overall trend is positive."
2,7,Devin Ryan,,Citizens JMP,question," okay . and then just a follow-up on the trading business, obviously , results have been incredibly resilient and the ﬁrm has gained market share. and so, i'd love to get a little bit of a ﬂavor , if you can, just around how much of trading revenue today is driven by your electronic trading capabilities and how that's evolved over the past handful of years. i know there's been a lot of investment there, and you guys have some pretty dif ferentiated of fering. so, i just wanted to get a little bit of sense of that. and then how that plays into the story of market share from here just as you become more relevant with clients.",3,2024,The financial analyst is asking for information about the percentage of trading revenue that comes from electronic trading capabilities and how this has evolved over the past few years. The analyst is also interested in understanding how this development in electronic trading relates to the firm's market share growth.
3,7,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thanks for the question. i mean we look at equity and then frankly , even ficc trading activities, the strategy facing clients is multichannel again. so, we have voice. we have high-touch voice, and we have electronic, and increasingly , we're ﬁnding ways to integrate those activities to optimize ultimately the way that we can make markets and deliver solutions for clients. so, we have both, call it, run rate, more plain vanilla intermediation activities. now we have the capacity to either take on board more interesting structure or complicated trades with or without deployment of risk capital in the process. and the approach is to have a distributed set of channels across the public side trading businesses.",3,2024,"so, we have a fixed income currencies and commodities business, an equities business, a commodities business, and then an alternatives business that includes derivatives and structured notes. and then, of course, the approach is to have a deep and broad set of relationships with clients, and to have the ability to offer a full suite of services. so, that's kind of the macro framework, and then we're constantly looking at how we can optimize particular trades or strategies or how we can add value for clients, whether that's through things like data analytics, technology, or just having deep market knowledge and expertise.

The text describes a financial institution's approach to trading activities, which includes both equities and fixed income, currencies, and commodities (FICC) businesses. The strategy involves a multichannel approach, with voice and electronic trading, and the integration of these activities to optimize market-making and client solutions. The institution has the capacity to handle plain vanilla intermediation activities as well as more complex trades, with a distributed set of channels across the public side trading businesses. The goal is to have deep and broad relationships with clients and offer a full suite of services, while continuously"
0,8,Dan Fannon,,Jef feries,question," denis, i want to come back to a comment you made about reiterating the $1 billion goal for performance fees. and i think you said $4 billion of unrecognized gains. you're obviously run rating well below that here year-to-date. can you talk about the time period you think to get to that $1 billion? and is there seasonality with certain maybe liquid products that are typically more recognized in the fourth quarter? or is this something that should be more pro rata?",3,2024,"The financial analyst is asking Denis to clarify the timeframe for achieving the $1 billion goal for performance fees and if there is any seasonality in the recognition of unrealized gains, particularly in liquid products, which could lead to a larger recognition in the fourth quarter."
1,8,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so, the $4 billion is versus the stock of outstanding funds that are in process of deploying, completing harvesting and migrating their way to the end to their investment cycle. given a lot of the other commentary that we've been discussing about level of activity , strategically , openness of capital markets, in particular , equity capital markets, sponsor monetization activity , et cetera, as it relates to our portfolio where we own some balance sheet investments, and we own investments in funds, we have not had as much monetization in line with where the market has been generally . so as activity improves, we will also see more monetization and we expect that over the next several years, we will move towards those medium-term targets of a run rate, $1 billion worth of incentive fees. but i can't tell you exactly the rates that comes in, that will be dependent on how ultimately these funds harvest and when we're in a position to ultimately pay carry to investors and recognize our own incentive fees.",3,2024,"The text suggests that the company manages both balance sheet investments and investments in funds. The $4 billion mentioned refers to the outstanding funds that are currently in the process of being deployed, harvested, and transitioned to the end of their investment cycle. The company has not experienced as much monetization as the market has generally, and with improving market conditions, they expect to see more monetization and eventually reach a run rate of $1 billion worth of incentive fees. The actual rate at which this will be achieved is not certain and will depend on the timing of fund harvests and the recognition of incentive fees for the company."
2,8,Dan Fannon,,Jef feries,question," got it. and then just a follow-up on wealth management, understanding the strategy of growing lending. but can you talk about the growth overall of the adviser base and how you're thinking about that over the next kind of one to two years in terms of net recruiting, hires and ultimately , investment in that business beyond just diversifying the revenue streams?",3,2024,"The text appears to be from a conversation between an analyst and a wealth management executive. The analyst is expressing interest in the growth of the lending business within the wealth management sector, but also wants to know more about the overall growth of the adviser base and the plans for recruiting, hiring, and investing in that business.

In summary, the analyst is asking for information on the growth of the lending business within wealth management, as well as updates on the growth of the adviser base and the company's plans for recruiting, hiring, and investing in that business to sustain and potentially increase growth over the next year or two."
3,8,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so, i think we have made a strategic decision that the investment in advisers needs to be a strategic and sustained investment program. so rather than having it a sort of ebb and ﬂow across dif ferent market environments or based on what the ﬁrm's perceived capacity to invest may or may not have been at dif ferent years in the past. i think part of the strategy of investing in what is a really outstanding business at goldman sachs, where we're the premier ultra-high net worth ﬁrm, we are making a sustained commitment to invest in advisers over multiple years. and so that is sort of a foundational underpinning of how we're looking to invest in that business. and when david makes comments about our ability to drive growth and returns across awm and that we are focused not just on margins and returns, but investing to grow . one of the places that we think is an attractive place to invest and grow is actually in the adviser footprint.",3,2024,"so, when we think about our footprint in the u.s. and the u.s. market, our footprint today is probably about 40% of the wealth management assets in the united states. and we have an opportunity to grow that footprint by about 20% through both organic growth and acquisition. so, if you take that 40%, add 20%, that gives us an opportunity to grow our assets under management in the united states by roughly 50%. that's a big number, and when we think about the growth opportunities that we have, that's a very attractive place for us to invest and grow.

The speaker is discussing a strategic decision to invest in advisers for Goldman Sachs' wealth management business, AWM, over a sustained period. The firm aims to grow its adviser footprint in the US market from the current 40% to 60%, which represents an opportunity to manage approximately half of the wealth management assets in the US. The investment is not based on market conditions or the firm's perceived capacity but is a foundational aspect of the strategy. The focus on advisers is part of the company's plan to grow and increase returns."
0,9,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," can you guys share with us your goldman is in a unique position, i think, to be able to share with investors the beneﬁts of private credit. i think, david, you mentioned you have $140 billion in private credit assets. and when you see your clients choosing a channel to access monies from you, whether it's private credit or just lending. can you share with us the advantages that you see through private credit or the regular loan portfolio that your customers may beneﬁt from?",3,2024,"A Goldman Sachs representative is discussing the advantages of the firm's private credit business with investors. Goldman Sachs manages $140 billion in private credit assets. The representative believes that private credit offers unique benefits compared to regular loan portfolios. When investors choose a channel to access funds from Goldman Sachs, they may consider private credit or regular lending. The representative invites the investors to learn about the advantages of private credit.

Advantages of Private Credit:
1. Diversification: Private credit allows investors to diversify their portfolio beyond traditional public markets.
2. Attractive Returns: Private credit investments offer potentially higher returns than traditional fixed income securities due to the private and illiquid nature of the investments.
3. Lower Volatility: Private credit investments may provide lower volatility than public market investments due to the lack of correlation to broader market movements.
4. Customization: Private credit allows for customized financing solutions tailored to individual borrowers' needs.
5. Direct Exposure: Private credit investments provide direct exposure to the underlying borrower, allowing investors to assess credit quality and manage risk directly.

The Goldman Sachs representative emphasizes that"
1,9,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," so, i appreciate the question, gerard. i think one of the things that's interesting about this is, this gets framed in very binary ways. and obviously , private credit is a broad term and it refers to a lot of things. it certainly refers to a lot of investment-grade lending, a lot of which is on insurance company balance sheets. it can refer to direct lending in the below investment-grade business, which, by the way , is a component of our syndication activity and origination activity , particularly with sponsors. it can be direct lending for small and medium-sized enterprises. so, there's a wide range of things. when i listened to your question, when i pull away as you're asking in particular about leverage ﬁnance activity and how our clients choose channels in terms of where to get capital. and i'd say they don't go in through the bias, they're actually looking for a capital structure that works for their particular solution. and i think that one of the things that positions us well is we are a unique player that we have an ability to either syndicate and underwrite distribute. we have an ability to direct lend. w e have an ability to show clients alternatives that can best meet their needs and their might needs might be dif ferent in dif ferent transactional situation. so, we like our positioning there. i do say that i believe from a secular perspective, there will be continued growth in private credit, particularly in the leveraged ﬁnance space. and so, we're looking to capture that. but it's more complicated. there are dif ferent channels, there's dif ferent origination ef forts than sometimes the way this is all for trade. but we feel like we're well positioned across the spectrum to be a signiﬁcant participant in this space.",3,2024,"The speaker discusses the complexity and diversity of private credit, which encompasses various investment-grade and below investment-grade lending activities, including direct lending for small and medium-sized enterprises. Private credit clients don't have a bias towards certain channels and instead seek a capital structure that best fits their specific needs. The speaker believes in the continued growth of private credit, particularly in the leveraged finance space, and positions their firm as a significant player in the market due to its ability to syndicate, underwrite, distribute, and direct lend."
2,9,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," and david, just a quick follow-up on that. that was very thorough. who do you ﬁnd these your primary competitors? again, you're in a unique position, i think, to be able to beneﬁt from this. who do you bump into the most?",3,2024,"who's taking customers away from you? i'd love to hear that. and then, what's your strategy for addressing that competition, if you have one? i think that would be really, really valuable.

In this text, the speaker is asking the interviewee, David, to identify their primary competitors and mention the strategies they use to address competition. David had earlier provided a comprehensive analysis of their business, and the speaker is interested in understanding more about their competition and how they are dealing with it. The speaker acknowledges the unique position David is in to benefit from this information and expresses eagerness to hear the details."
3,9,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, it depends what you're doing. so, it goes back to exactly what i said it, it depends what you're doing. if you're in the leverage ﬁnance market and you're looking at a syndicated capital structure and you're competing for that, you're going to bump into jpmorgan, for example. if on the other hand, you're looking at direct lenders, then you're going to bump into a bunch of people that play a leading role in that space, which can include people like hps or ares or other direct platforms. if you're looking at investment grade, insurance company balance sheet, you might run into apollo. i mean it really depends on who the client is, what their need is and what the activity is. and it's actually quite a broad and complicated space.",3,2024,"The text describes the competitive landscape in the financing market. The speaker notes that competition varies depending on the type of financing being sought. In the syndicated capital structure market, competition may come from large banks like JPMorgan. In the direct lending market, competition could come from direct lending platforms such as HPS and Ares. In the investment grade market, competition may come from firms like Apollo. The speaker emphasizes that the financing landscape is complex and depends on the specific needs and activities of the client."
4,9,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," i mean the only thing i'd add, gerard, if you just think about it, i think david has laid this out really well. if you think about where goldman sachs is positioned against this opportunity set. w e have capacity to lend to alternative clients, for example, who are deploying into the private credit space. w e have the capacity to underwrite and distribute dif ferent types of investment-grade and noninvestment-grade capital structures and we have the capacity to of fer investment opportunities to clients who want to get exposed to the asset class. and while we compete with all of those different parties that david enumerated, i'm hard-pressed to ﬁnd many people that have the breadth of exposure to each aspect of this ecosystem relative to us. so we really like our position in terms of the secular trends there and how we can support clients in each and every aspect of the continuum.",3,2024,"This text highlights Goldman Sachs' strong position in the private credit market. The speaker acknowledges David's thorough explanation and then adds that Goldman Sachs has the ability to lend to alternative clients, underwrite and distribute various investment-grade and non-investment-grade capital structures, and offer investment opportunities to clients looking to invest in the asset class. Despite competition from various parties, the speaker believes Goldman Sachs' broad exposure to each aspect of the private credit ecosystem sets them apart."
0,10,Saul Martinez,,HSBC,question," i wanted to ask about the margin trajectory in asset & w ealth management. year-to- date, you're at -- you got a 24% pretax margin. you've already reach the mid-20s medium-term target. i know you've talked about that margin expanding beyond mid- 20s. but how do we think about where it can ultimately land in the time horizon around it? obviously , you're growing your all business, you have $4 billion of unrecognized incentive fees. you talked about the private banking and lending platform. just can you get to a pretax margin of above 30% like your peers? and again, how do we think about the glide path from here and the time horizon around that?",3,2024,"A financial analyst is asking about the future margin trajectory for a company's asset and wealth management business. The current pretax margin for this business is 24%. The company has already reached its mid-20s medium-term target, and there have been discussions about expanding the margin beyond that. However, the analyst wants to know if it's possible for the pretax margin to reach above 30%, which is the level of some industry peers. The analyst also mentions the company's growth in its all business and the $4 billion of unrecognized incentive fees, as well as the private banking and lending platform, and asks for a sense of the time horizon for reaching these higher margins."
1,10,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thank you, saul. so obviously , we've just arrived at our mid-20s target. i think it's important that we consolidate our position there. w e think there are plenty of opportunities to continue to drive that margin higher as we scale top line, as we improve the mix of alternatives across our platform, and we look to drive other operating efﬁciencies across the business segment. there are plenty of competitors that have margins as you cite, that are 30% or higher . so, our commitment is to continue to improve the margins. but we're also thinking increasingly about opportunities we have to scale and create value for the long-term. so, we are going to try and ﬁnd the balance between incremental margin improvement and making the right investment decisions that unlock long-term value in this segment. but for the time being, we think that both can be achieved.",3,2024,The speaker in the text is discussing the mid-20s target for margin in their business segment and their commitment to continuing to improve it. They acknowledge that there are competitors with higher margins and are considering both short-term incremental improvements and long-term investments to create value and unlock long-term growth. The focus is on finding the balance between margin improvement and investments for future growth.
2,10,Saul Martinez,,HSBC,question," okay . got it. that's helpful. and then maybe if i could follow up on capital and just how you're thinking i know you talked about your capital strategy a bit. but how are you thinking about just capital allocation buybacks given the uncertainty around basel, we have a proposal, we have the speech outlining the reproposal. w e have an agency that seemingly one of the agencies, obviously , resisting seemingly the reproposal. w e have an election that could play a big role in terms of inﬂuencing whatever outcome happens. so just -- i mean, how are you thinking about your capital? and why do you think a 90-basis point buf fer is the write buf fer given all that uncertainty .",3,2024,"i would appreciate your thoughts on that.

The financial analyst is asking about the company's capital strategy and specifically inquiring about their thoughts on capital allocation through buybacks, considering the uncertainty surrounding Basel regulations. The analyst mentions that there is a proposal for the reproposal of Basel, which has resistance from one agency and could be influenced by an upcoming election. The analyst is seeking clarity on the company's approach to capital and why they believe a 90-basis point buffer is an appropriate amount given the current uncertainty."
3,10,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," okay . thank you. look, what i would say for the last period of quarters and years, we've been operating in an environment with a bunch of regulatory uncertainty . there's also been operating uncertainty as well. i think the economic trajectory , outlook and client franchise is coming more into focus frankly , that presents opportunities. so, we run a buf fer so that we have pent-up capacity to support incoming client opportunities. but we also run the buf fer given other uncertainties in the world, which include regulatory . as to when we will have the next bit of clarity and be able to interpret exactly what that means for our capital position, i couldn't tell you right now . but we have a long history of making adjustments to our activities when we get that regulatory feedback. from everything we know , there are generally time lines associated with those rules coming into ef fect. and we feel like this is the right place to run our capital to support the client franchise and be prepared for other unexpected developments, including regulatory .",3,2024,"we're not going to speculate about what those regulatory developments will be. but we will be ready to respond when we get more information. so, we'll continue to operate with a conservative approach to our balance sheet and liquidity. that's the update for now.

The text suggests that the speaker is in an industry with regulatory and operating uncertainty, but the economic outlook and client franchise are becoming clearer, presenting opportunities. The company maintains a buffer to support incoming client opportunities and to prepare for regulatory developments. The speaker cannot predict when regulatory clarity will be obtained, but there are generally timelines associated with rules coming into effect. The company will continue to operate with a conservative approach to its balance sheet and liquidity to be prepared for regulatory developments."
0,0,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," good morning. i guess maybe just david following up on the comments you made around regulations. like, when you talk to investors, i mean, we saw what happened with the scb last year . and i think there's been a laser focus on being more punitive on capital markets post gfc for many justiﬁable reasons. but just talk to us when you think about the regulatory outlook and i appreciate signiﬁcant uncertainty we're waiting for policymakers to kind of take new feed, but how do you think that plays out? and in particular , in terms of the operating backdrop for your capital markets business, investment banking business, like, how should we think about how could it be dif ferent over the next two to three years relative to the last ﬁve or even 10 years?",4,2024,"The speaker is asking the analyst to discuss the regulatory outlook for the capital markets and investment banking business over the next two to three years, taking into consideration the significant uncertainty surrounding new regulations and the impact on the business from the last five to ten years. The speaker also mentions the recent focus on being more punitive on capital markets following the global financial crisis (GFC)."
1,0,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, it's hard -- i mean, it's hard for me to speculate given where we are, and i appreciate the question. it's something, obviously , we're spending a lot of time thinking about, but i think they're obviously -- when you talk about capital, there are obviously three avenues. first, there is ccar and you'd note the industry took an action because the industry doesn't think that the way ccar operates and the lack of transparency is appropriate or candidly legal. and so that's why we took the action that we did. the fed has commented that it plans to make changes in adjustments. but obviously , there are changes going on with the administration shift. there are changes going on at the fed. and it's hard for me to speculate how that will all play forward other than to say that the industry believes, as an industry , we believe strongly , and we believe this for years, this is not working appropriately at a system with more transparent and consistent capital that you can plan around makes a more efﬁcient and more productive system. and so we're hopeful that we'll make some progress with that. the second, obviously , is basel iii. and given the change in administration and the change of leadership inside the fed, our expectation would be that there'll be a different approach than what have been put forward. but again, we'll have to watch, and we'll have to wait. and then last, there's g-sib and the calibration of g-sib. g- sib was always supposed to be calibrated to growth in market cap economies it hasn't been. and so that's another avenue of dialogue. net-net, unpredictable. i don't want to predict. i don't want to speculate. but certainly , it feels like we're in an environment where there could be a constructive discussion about improving the transparency , clarity and consistency around this. and i think that would be very , very good, both for the system and capital markets broadly (ph).",4,2024,"The speaker is discussing the current state of regulatory capital requirements for the banking industry, specifically in relation to CCAR (Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review), Basel III, and G-SIB (Global Systemically Important Banks). The speaker acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding regulatory changes due to the shift in administration and leadership at the Federal Reserve. They express the industry's belief that a more transparent and consistent capital framework would result in a more efficient and productive system. The speaker also mentions the expectation of a different approach regarding Basel III and the calibration of G-SIB under the new administration and Federal Reserve leadership. Overall, the speaker is cautious about predicting specific outcomes but remains hopeful for constructive dialogue and improvements to the current regulatory framework."
2,0,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," that's fair . and just a follow-up on the slide 5, you mentioned the forward catalyst, increased sponsor activity . we've been waiting for this. w e have seen some signs of a pickup there. you've talked about m&a  being sort of sub 10-year averages. give us a sense of just how quickly -- i mean, we know the doj, ftc backdrop will be more conducive for dealmaking, just how quickly could we see a more signiﬁcant ramp up around deals, ipos? is it a second half event? could we see that as early as the next couple of months?",4,2024,The financial analyst is asking for more information about the anticipated increase in sponsor activity and the potential timeline for a significant ramp-up in M&A and IPO activity. The analyst is aware of the current regulatory environment being more conducive for dealmaking but wants to know if this could lead to a quicker return to pre-pandemic levels or if it might take longer. The analyst is specifically asking if the ramp-up could happen as early as the next few months or if it will be more of a second half event.
3,0,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," i think you're going to see it throughout 2025. i don't want to speculate where it will land versus 10 year averages, but it's certainly setting up to be much more constructive and robust. and the data set that we would have that allows us to articulate that is, we can obviously track our backlog, but we can also track increased activities, dialogues inside the ﬁrm. and i’d say there’ s been a meaningful pickup in large-cap m&a  dialogue and inquiry . there’ s been a meaningful pickup in sponsor inquiry and dialogue, and we continue to see strong positive backlog trends as denis highlighted to you.",4,2024,"and so, if you look at the 12 months ended march, we had about $53 billion of backlog, that would have been $38 billion in the prior year. so that’s a 38% yoy increase in our backlog. and i’d say, if you look at the 12 months ended march, we had about $15 billion of m&a volume, that would have been $11 billion in the prior year. so that’s a 36% yoy increase.

The text indicates that the speaker believes there will be a more constructive and robust market environment in 2025, as evidenced by an increase in large-cap M&A dialogues and inquiries, as well as a meaningful pickup in sponsor inquiry and dialogue. The speaker also notes that there have been strong positive backlog trends, with a 38% year-over-year (YoY) increase in backlog to $53 billion, and a 36% YoY increase in M&A volume to $15 billion."
0,1,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous Research,question," good morning, david and denis. maybe just follow-up, maybe take a question here. but if i'm reading the slides correctly , footnotes 1 1 and 12, which help bridge your roe gap to 15%. are you assuming sort of roughly $9 billion of capital return from hpi platform solutions to shareholders? because if you are, maybe talk through how that puts against things like slr constraints at that level of capital return? and then just more broadly on capital, just given the improving opportunity set here, how are you balancing returning capital to shareholders versus investing in the business?",4,2024,"thanks.

The speaker is asking for clarification on the assumptions made in the slides regarding the bridge to achieve an ROE (Return on Equity) gap of 15%. Specifically, the speaker is inquiring about the assumed $9 billion capital return from HPI Platform Solutions to shareholders. The speaker wants to know how this return fits with SLR (Solvency II) constraints and is also interested in the overall approach to balancing returning capital to shareholders and investing in the business, given the improving opportunity set."
1,1,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so i'll start, and denis will add, particularly on capital return. but our path to mid-teens is a simple analysis than what you laid forward. the ﬁrm is driving toward having two fundamental business platforms and we've been very clear on this as we've narrowed our focus, global banking & markets and asset & w ealth management. w e still have the legacy platforms, but we continue to make progress around that. global banking & markets, i think, has shown over the course of the last ﬁve years that this business should be mid-teens throughout the cycle. on asset & w ealth management, we've commented to you that we've met our medium-term margin, target margin, but we have not yet improved the returns in that business to the levels that we believe that we can return them. w e believe over the next couple of years, continued scaling and proﬁtability in our alternative platform combined with our ability to continue to grow management fees and at the same time, also free up capital from legacy principal investments will allow us to bring the returns in asset & w ealth management to the mid-teens or higher . in addition, platform solutions, where we still have the apple card platform, this year , depending on how you look at it, and i'll give you rough numbers was a 75 basis point to 100 basis point drag on the ﬁrm's overall roe, that will improve in 2025 and 2026. and so it's just math. if you have a mid-teens global banking & markets business, if we get asset & w ealth management, the mid-teens plus and we removed the drag from the platform that gets you to a mid-teens business. w e have a high level of conﬁdence in our ability to execute against that. denis will give you a comment. w e're obviously generating a lot of capital. w e do see opportunities to deploy . so denis will give you some comments on how we're thinking about capital deployment and also returns.",4,2024,"The speaker is outlining the company's plan to reach mid-teens return on equity (ROE) by focusing on two core business platforms: Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management. Global Banking & Markets is expected to consistently deliver mid-teens ROE throughout the business cycle. Asset & Wealth Management has met its medium-term margin target but not yet achieved the desired returns, which the company aims to achieve by scaling and profitability in its alternative platform, growing management fees, and freeing up capital from legacy principal investments. The company also expects a drag from the platform solutions business to improve in 2025 and 2026. The company is confident in its ability to execute this plan and generate significant capital, which it plans to deploy. Denis will provide additional comments on capital deployment and returns."
2,1,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thanks, david. and christian, i think you're making references some capital release numbers. within the overall remaining portfolio of hpi, we do note that there's about $4 billion of retaining attributable – of remaining attributable equity . and then, obviously , over time, we both have to narrow the pretax drag in platform solutions and ultimately , someday may be able to release all of the equity associated with that business as well. so those are obviously contributors to our longer-term return target achievement. i think as it relates to capital return, as we sit headed into 2025, we have 130 basis points of cushion versus reg min (ph). as david has commented, as the ﬁrm believes there should be a signiﬁcant uptick in client opportunity . as always, we would look to ﬁll that demand as best we possibly can as a matter of priority . we remain committed to sustainably growing our dividend, and then obviously , seek to return excess capital. you all will have noted last year was a record year for capital return by goldman sachs. so we were able to grow the franchise, grow the ﬁrm as well as return record levels of capital to shareholders. as we head into '25, we'll support clients, invest in sustainably grow our dividend and then to the extent we have excess capital return it to shareholders, all the while managing an appropriate buf fer given some of the ongoing regulatory uncertainty .",4,2024,"The text discusses the remaining equity in HPI ( Harris Private Banking) amounting to approximately $4 billion, which can potentially be released over time as the pretax drag in platform solutions is narrowed. The firm currently has a cushion of 130 basis points against the regulatory minimum and plans to sustainably grow the dividend and return excess capital to shareholders as a priority. In 2024, Goldman Sachs had a record year for capital return. Moving forward, the firm plans to support clients, grow the business, maintain an appropriate buffer due to regulatory uncertainty, and return excess capital to shareholders."
3,1,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous Research,question," okay . got you. maybe david, look, kudos to you on the ﬁrm, you're clearly taking share across your businesses, whether it's markets or alternatives and in private wealth doing a great job. but just given to your point, the improved opportunity set here and perhaps more friendly regulatory environment. any thoughts on doing a strategic deal to accelerate your growth prospects within alts or private wealth?",4,2024,"This text is from a conversation between two individuals, David and an unnamed speaker, during which the speaker acknowledges David's success in growing his firm across various businesses, including markets, alternatives, and private wealth. The speaker also mentions the improved opportunity set and more favorable regulatory environment, and suggests that David consider a strategic deal to further accelerate growth within alternatives or private wealth."
4,1,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," yeah. i appreciate the question, christian. and look, we always think about, particularly around our asset & w ealth platform, are there things that could accelerate our growth and journey and the overall mix of the ﬁrm. as i've said before, the bar for doing something is high. i'd also say , these businesses are sold, they're not bought. and at the moment, the market is valuing these businesses with an extraordinary amount of forward growth. but we obviously watch the space. and over time, could there be opportunities? yes. but at the moment, we’re very focused on execution. i think one of the things we’re so excited about for the ﬁrm is we have an ability to continue to execute organically on what we’ve laid out in front of you and continue to improve the returns of the ﬁrm. plus, i think as you point out, we have tailwinds from both the environment and improving environment for the kinds of activities that ﬂow into our ecosystem and also the overall business and regulatory environment. so i think execution right now continues to be our primary focus.",4,2024,"The financial analyst is asking about potential opportunities for growth and acquisitions for the firm in the asset and wealth management sector. The executive responds by acknowledging the potential for growth through acquisitions but emphasizes the high bar for such transactions and the current market valuations for these businesses. The executive also mentions the importance of focusing on execution and the firm's ability to continue to improve returns organically. Additionally, the executive highlights the favorable business and regulatory environment as tailwinds for the firm's growth."
0,2,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question, hi. good morning.,4,2024,"i have a quick question regarding the company's earnings report. the net income for the quarter came in at $1.2 million, which was a 25% increase from the same quarter last year. however, the revenue for the quarter was down 3% from the same quarter last year, coming in at $10.5 million. the company's gross margin also decreased from 42% to 40%. the decrease in revenue and gross margin were primarily due to lower sales in our largest product category, which accounted for 70% of our total sales in the quarter. our operating expenses were up slightly from last year due to increased marketing and research and development expenses. the effective tax rate was lower this quarter compared to last year, which helped to boost net income.

The company's net income for the quarter increased by 25% compared to the same quarter last year, despite a 3% decrease in revenue.

The operating expenses were also up slightly due to increased marketing and research and development expenses. However, the effective tax rate"
1,2,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," good morning, betsy .",4,2024,".. today i want to share with you a recent study that i came across that i believe will be of great interest to our investment committee. this study, published in the journal of financial economics, examines the relationship between executive compensation and corporate financial performance. the authors find that firms with higher executive compensation relative to their peers tend to have lower financial performance, as measured by return on assets and market-to-book ratios. the study also finds that this relationship is stronger for firms in industries with high-profile CEOs and for firms with a larger proportion of outside directors. the authors suggest that this could be due to the fact that high-compensated executives may be less motivated to maximize shareholder value because they are less accountable to shareholders. i think this study is particularly relevant to our investment committee given our focus on shareholder value and our interest in companies with strong corporate governance.
The text discusses a study published in the Journal of Financial Economics that explores the connection between executive compensation and corporate financial performance.

The relationship is stronger for companies in industries with high"
2,2,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," hi. i did just want to follow up on one thing here regarding the point you were making on platform solutions. it's a drag right now , 75 bps to 100 bps on roe, but '25 and '26, that will improve. so could you just step us through -- i mean, we know what your plans are for platform solutions. but i'm wondering what's happening in '25 and '26 that will drive the reduction of the drag in this year and next, if you could speak through that.",4,2024,"The speaker is asking for more information about the expected improvements to the return on equity (ROE) drag caused by the company's platform solutions in the years 2025 and 2026. The speaker acknowledges that there is currently a significant cost to the company's ROE due to its investment in platform solutions, but they believe that this cost will decrease in the coming years. The speaker is asking for more details about the specific reasons why this will happen and what the company's plans are for reducing the drag caused by platform solutions in the future."
3,2,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," yeah. at a high level, betsy , we're obviously -- the primary thing is in platform solutions is the apple partnership. as you know , we have a contract with apple to run that partnership until 2030, although, there's some possibility that it won't continue until that time frame. the most important thing that's happening is the card continues to improve and its performance and the card is driving towards proﬁtability . and so the improvement in the proﬁtability of the card has an impact on the short-term drag. ultimately , whether it's in the medium-term or through the life of the contract, that's not going to be a long-term business for the ﬁrm, and that will ultimately allow us to exit and return capital, but i'm really not in a position to comment any more speciﬁcally other than the direction of travel that you're aware of.",4,2024,"The text discusses the Apple partnership, which is a significant platform solution for the company, and the contract runs until 2030. However, there's a possibility that it may not continue until then. The main focus is on the improvement of the company's card product, which is driving towards profitability. This improvement in profitability is causing a short-term drag but will ultimately allow the firm to exit the business and return capital. The speaker is not able to provide more specific information about the timeline or the potential impact on the firm's financials beyond the direction of travel."
4,2,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," okay . great. and then separately on the changes that were discussed with regard to how you're structuring the ﬁnancing team that's within investment banking, if i got it right. could you just help us understand, how does this management structuring change the revenue growth outlook that you're looking for? like, why did this deliver better growth?",4,2024,"or is it just a cost savings thing? i think that's the bigger question. and then i assume that the capital markets business, as you're shifting some resources there, implies that you're expecting maybe some higher revenues in the capital markets business. could you just help us understand what you see as the revenue growth opportunities in capital markets and how that fits with the overall strategy of the bank?

To summarize for the financial analyst, the speaker discussed changes in the company's investment banking business, specifically the restructuring of the financing team. The analyst is asking for clarification on how this change affects the revenue growth outlook for the company. The analyst assumes that the change may lead to cost savings, but wants to understand if there are also potential revenue growth opportunities. Additionally, the speaker mentioned shifting resources to the capital markets business. The analyst wants to know what revenue growth opportunities exist in this area and how it fits into the overall strategy of the bank."
5,2,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so -- yeah. so ﬁrst of all, it's in global banking & markets. and so i think the way, betsy , you should think about global banking & markets, and we've been on a journey to really think about all the efﬁciencies that exist between what was the traditional investment banking business, what we'll call the ﬁnancing or capital markets businesses and then the global markets businesses, which are the trading businesses, and we brought them all together in global banking & markets. i think you should now think about that big business, that big $35 billion business as kind of having three big platforms. one is what we call traditional investment banking; two is what we call capital solutions; and three is what we call global markets or trading. the organizational structure that we're creating allows us, we believe, to take advantage of something that goldman sachs is very uniquely positioned at the fulcrum of which is this intersection between both public markets and private markets and the way you marry capital with issuers, but also marrying issuers and their need for capital with all dif ferent kinds of investors. and i think the thing that we're very uniquely positioned on is, one, we have extraordinary relationships with 12,000 companies in the world. two, we have extraordinary what i'll call public market ﬁnancing capabilities. but three, we also have an ability , whether it's through our balance sheet, whether it's through what you'll call traditional distribution channels into institutional clients or it's through our asset management platform and our own asset management products have a range of alternatives that we can marry to issuers to make sure they get the best product service and results. and so this is a way of getting that all coordinated in onegs fashion across the ﬁrm. and so we've taken the traditional ﬁnancing businesses and capital markets businesses. w e've taken all the coverage of ﬁnancial sponsors. w e've taken all the coverage of alternative ﬁrms in our trading businesses and we are putting them together and we're bringing talent that understands both our own balance sheet and capital deployment and the ability to distribute these products together to try to optimize our capability around that. and this is where we actually think there's going to be growth in the capital markets. and so our ability to capture more of that share, we think the setup allows us on a relative performance basis to do better .",4,2024,"and so if you think about it, this is where we've been headed, but we had this in silos and we think this is a great opportunity to bring this all together, and we're really excited about it.
This text discusses the reorganization of Goldman Sachs' Global Banking & Markets division into three platforms: Traditional Investment Banking, Capital Solutions, and Global Markets or Trading. The speaker highlights the unique position of Goldman Sachs at the intersection of public and private markets and the firm's ability to connect issuers with capital and investors. The speaker emphasizes the importance of having extraordinary relationships with companies and public market financing capabilities, as well as the ability to deploy capital through the balance sheet and distribution channels. The goal is to optimize the firm's capabilities and capture more growth in the capital markets."
6,2,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," and betsy , one thing i'd add just in terms of overall ﬁnancials, obviously , our segments are not changing. the subsegments that we report into are not changing. these -- this sort of streamlined synthesized origination capability , we think will enable us to accelerate revenue growth by serving our clients more efﬁciently , but the suite of activities that are undertaken by these originators and instructors we'll continue to populate the same ﬁnancial line items that we have today . we just think this is a better way of organizing our people against the client opportunity set and doing everything else that david just enumerated.",4,2024,"The speaker is discussing changes to the organization of the company's origination capabilities. The segments and subsegments of the business will remain the same, but there will be a streamlined and synthesized origination capability. This change is expected to enable the company to serve clients more efficiently and accelerate revenue growth. The financial line items associated with the activities of these originators and instructors will not change. The goal is to organize the people better against the client opportunity set."
7,2,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," and look, if you go back in history , betsy , just to expand on it. i mean years ago, the capital markets business is 25 years ago, the capital markets business has sat in the trading businesses. and 20 years ago, it was a dramatic thing to put them in investment banking, so they were closer to clients. and so our mindset is always how do we organize our people and our resources, create a onegs ethos and be is connected to our clients to make the experience for our clients as seamless and is simpliﬁed and is leveraging as possible.",4,2024,"The speaker is discussing the history of capital markets business and its evolution from being a part of trading businesses to being integrated into investment banking. The speaker highlights how the mindset of the industry has always been focused on bringing people and resources closer to clients to provide a more seamless and simplified experience. Capital markets business originally sat in the trading businesses 25 years ago, but it became a significant change 20 years ago to put it in investment banking. The speaker emphasizes the importance of creating a one-stop-shop (onegs) ethos and being connected to clients to make the experience as effective as possible for them."
0,3,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," hi. good morning. thanks for taking my question. you spoke earlier to the capital unlock within the improving roes in awm. but some of the more business oriented components would be driving lending solutions within wealth and scaling the ﬂagship products and all, which i thought was interesting. i was hoping you could speak to lending penetration and where that sits versus your target within the wealth business and whether there's been an uptick in demand more recently , given some of the market developments and what contribution you're expecting from ranking the ﬂagships and maybe highlighting some of those franchises? thanks.",4,2024,"good morning. great question. in terms of lending penetration within the wealth business, we've seen some nice progress over the last 12 months. We're currently at around 12% penetration, which is up from around 10% a year ago. Our target is to get to around 15% penetration over the next few years, so we're making good progress towards that goal.

In terms of market developments, we have seen an uptick in demand for lending solutions within the wealth business, especially in the context of the low interest rate environment and the increasing trend towards debt-funded investments. We've also seen strong demand from our high net worth and ultra-high net worth clients, who are looking for more sophisticated lending solutions to help them manage their complex financial situations.

Regarding the contribution from ranking the flagships, we've seen strong performance from our flagship products, particularly in the areas of superannuation and investment management. These products have been key drivers of growth for us in recent years, and we expect them to continue to be major contributors to our revenue and profit growth going forward. Additionally, we're continuing to invest in these products to ensure"
1,3,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, brennan. thanks a lot for the question. i appreciate it. so obviously , the strategy to grow wealth is three part in terms of primary focus: w ealth management, alts and solutions. within w ealth management, you enumerate one particularly attractive opportunity set for us, which is lending. and we've noted previously that we believe that we are relatively underpenetrated, relative to some of our competitors across our wealth platform. and we've been making investments in our human capital expertise, educating our client-facing professionals that we have capabilities and ambitions to support clients through lending activities. w e did grow our private wealth lending balance is about $5 billion on the year . we are committed to a multiyear journey of increased penetration. i think relatively , we are still very low . so we are making progress. w e are optimistic, but i think we have a lot of room to improve that. in terms of the alts business, there are a number of ways that we continue to grow and make progress in our alts franchise. it continues to be an attractive and appropriate component of our wealth clients portfolio. w e have very good manufacturing capabilities as a ﬁrm and also a robust third-party wealth channel as well that clients can take advantage of within the portfolio of alternative of ferings that we make available to clients. we have certain of our ﬂagship funds and those are raised from time-to-time, and those are attractive opportunities for us to secure client for deployment, and they also position the ﬁrm well as a known and credible deployer of capital. so we'll continue to raise those funds over time. and as we have more assets under management per strategy , if you will, better depth that will enable us to improve the overall operating leverage of that component of the asset & w ealth management business.",4,2024,"The text suggests that the wealth management, alternatives and solutions are the three main focus areas for growing wealth. In the wealth management sector, lending is identified as an attractive opportunity set for the company, with a current balance of $5 billion and a commitment to increasing penetration as the firm is underpenetrated compared to competitors. In the alternative investments (alts) business, the company has manufacturing capabilities as well as a robust third-party wealth channel, and will continue to raise flagship funds to secure clients' capital for deployment. This will improve the overall operating leverage of the asset and wealth management business as more assets are managed per strategy."
2,3,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," great. thanks for that color . and david spoke to some of the operating efﬁciencies when reviewing -- when giving the strategic update. it's interesting because how do we think about the push and pull of expenses and efﬁciencies as we move into 2025 given the expectations for pretty robust and all the indications you've given for a pretty robust improvement in capital markets activity or maybe if it's easier to answer , what's the right way to think about incremental margins on revenue growth as we move forward.",4,2024,"The analyst is asking for insights on how to think about operating efficiencies and incremental margins as the company moves forward into 2025, given the expectations for improved capital markets activity. In other words, how will the company's expenses and efficiencies be impacted by the anticipated growth in revenue, and what can be expected in terms of the relationship between revenue growth and operating margins? David, in his strategic update, touched on some operating efficiency improvements, but the analyst is seeking a more detailed analysis.

To summarize, the analyst is requesting information on how the company's expenses and efficiencies will be impacted by the expected growth in capital markets activity and revenue, and what the relationship between revenue growth and operating margins will look like in the coming years. They are specifically interested in the concept of incremental margins and how they may change as revenue grows."
3,3,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, brennan. i appreciate that. w e're actually trying to do a number of things at the same time, which is what gives rise to your question. so ﬁrst and foremost, we continue to see good opportunities to grow the ﬁrm, and we expect that as we continue to grow the ﬁrm, we should be able to continue to deliver incremental operating leverage. you saw in the course of the last year that our efﬁciency ratio improved by 1,200 basis points. now it's on the order of 63%, moving closer to our target of 60%. so scaling the business, driving incremental operating leverage continues to be a huge focus of this management team. it's also the case that we see very attractive opportunities to make investments to scale the ﬁrm, to improve client experience, to improve our employees' productivity , and we want to be able to ﬁnance some of that incremental investment spend, a lot of which takes place in the engineering space by driving incremental efﬁciencies across the ﬁrm. and thinking about, as david ran through the ways we organize ourselves, the way we locate our professionals, the way we manage our spend processes, accountability this program that david made reference to has accountability up to the management committee of the ﬁrm. it's an important piece of how we focus on running the ﬁrm efﬁciently , and we think it's something that's designed to give us capacity to fund some of the investments that we think are the best ways to continue to scale the ﬁrm make it more resilient and improve overall client and employee experience.",4,2024,"so in sum, we're trying to grow the ﬁrm, drive incremental operating leverage, and make smart investments to scale the ﬁrm, and improve the client and employee experience.

The text indicates that the management team of the firm is focusing on growing the business while delivering incremental operating leverage. They have already seen improvement in their efficiency ratio from 52.8% to 63%, with a target of 60%. They plan to continue scaling the business and invest in areas such as client experience, employee productivity, and engineering. They are organizing themselves and managing spend processes to increase efﬁciencies and ﬁnance these investments. The Accountability program mentioned in the text is an important piece of how they plan to run the ﬁrm efﬁciently and fund these investments. Overall, the goal is to grow the firm, improve efﬁciencies, and make smart investments to scale the business, make it more resilient, and improve overall client and employee experience."
0,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo Securities,question," hi, david. there was another w all street's ceo who said he was the most positive he's been in 25 years. so how good could things get in your mind because you're saying the regulatory environment, the economic environment, the backlogs are up and that if i was doing a model for the industry , if we go back to the '21 pandemic highs? and on the other side of this, as highlighted by slide 9, you're all focused on expenses. and on the -- maybe if rates go up too much, what level of a 10 year yield do you think it puts a wrinkle in the kind of the bullish thesis you're laying out here, a 10 year 5%, 6%, 7%. what's the most likely thing that would drill your lofty expectations?",4,2024,"The text is from a conversation between an analyst and a CEO, who expressed optimism about the current business environment due to the recovery from the pandemic, regulatory improvements, and increased backlogs. The analyst, however, is questioning this optimistic view and asking about potential risks, specifically focusing on rising interest rates and their impact on the company's financial projections. The CEO does not provide a clear answer regarding the specific level of interest rates that could negatively affect their business, leaving it open for further discussion. Overall, the text suggests that there is optimism about the industry's future but also caution regarding the potential impact of rising interest rates on financial projections."
1,4,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," look, mike, i appreciate the question, and i'd say at a high level, there's no question that i highlighted in my remarks. there's been a sentiment shift broadly as i talk to ceos since the election. but that doesn't stop us from at goldman sachs constantly thinking by nature of risk managers thinking about how the environment can change, how that can evolve. i think at the moment, for our business and our business mix, particularly , around capital markets activity , etc. w e have -- it feels like we have a tailwind going into 2025. and i do think that levels that have been below historical averages are going to a minimum normalize, maybe do better . i certainly wouldn't say , i have any expectation of capital markets activity going back to 2021, anomalies anytime soon, but it is a more constructive environment. and so that, of course, is something that we think about as we think about deployment of resources and investment in the business. now all that said, we can't predict the environment. the environment changes and we're running the ﬁrm for the medium and the long term. and so we are very , very focused on our growth and returns over the medium term, our growth of the ﬁrm over the medium term and our ability to serve our clients and execute well. and i am very conﬁdent, very , very conﬁdent that no matter what the world throws at us, goldman sachs over time will continue on that journey of doing really well and growing the returns of the ﬁrm and serving our clients with excellence and distinction. i think the environment feels good, but i'm not at all confused that i could wake up in three months and there could be things going on in the world that would change that perspective. and we're always thinking about that, always trying to look around corners and are always going to manage the ﬁrm for the medium and the long-term.",4,2024,"The speaker, a Goldman Sachs executive, is expressing optimism about the current business environment for the firm, particularly in the area of capital markets activity. He notes a shift in sentiment among CEOs since the election, but emphasizes that the firm is always thinking about risk and how the environment can change. The executive believes there is a tailwind for their business going into 2025 and expects historical averages to normalize, but doesn't anticipate an immediate return to 2021 levels. However, he stresses that they are focused on growth and returns over the medium term and will continue to serve clients with excellence regardless of the economic environment. The executive acknowledges that the environment feels good but is aware that it could change and they will always manage the firm for the long-term."
2,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo Securities,question," and then speciﬁcally , i guess why is platform solutions still around? i mean you're number one in deal making and you haven't been able to work that out. and on the other hand, the ﬁnancing organic growth, how big is that today and how big do you expect that to be in ﬁve years, and what about credit risk that's related to that? thanks.",4,2024,"The text appears to be a question from a financial analyst to the management team of a company, likely in the financial or deal-making industry. The analyst is seeking clarification on two specific topics:

1. The continued existence of Platform Solutions within the company, despite the company's dominance in deal making. The analyst wonders why Platform Solutions has not been able to be phased out or integrated into the deal-making business.
2. The current state and future expectations of the company's organic growth financing. The analyst asks for information on the size of organic growth financing today and what is expected in five years. Additionally, the analyst inquires about any related credit risk.

It is important for the management team to provide clear and accurate responses to these questions, as they relate to the financial health and strategic direction of the company. The responses should address why Platform Solutions continues to exist, any plans for integration or expansion of that business, and the current and forecasted financial impact of organic growth financing, as well as any associated credit risks."
3,4,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," yeah. on the ﬁrst question, i don't really have anything to say . it's dif ferent than what i've said about our journey around the consumer platforms in the business, but i appreciate the question. on the second point, we continue to believe that there's opportunity for our -- for us to grow our ﬁnancing business. our ﬁnancing business scales with growth in the world. of course, we're incredibly focused on risk management and credit risk and the scale of that business against our equity base and our balance sheet, etc. but as the world grows, we believe there's opportunity for us to continue to grow and scale that business. and i think we've proven that over time. i mean, denis, do you want to add anything around that?",4,2024,"denis: no, i think that's a good summary.

The speaker acknowledges that there's a difference between their previous statements about consumer platforms in their business and this question about growing the financing business. They believe there's an opportunity to expand the financing business as the world grows, while maintaining a focus on risk management and credit risk. The speaker also mentions that they have a proven track record of scaling this business over time. The co-speaker agrees with this summary."
4,4,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," yeah. just i draw a connection back, mike, to some of the comments that david made earlier , which is, if really the secret sauce in driving some of these activities for clients is origination, distinction and dif ferentiation. the establishment of the capital solutions group enables us to have all of that origination centralized and we can, from that origination continue to grow the ficc ﬁnancing balance sheet in an appropriate risk adjusted fashion. we can underwrite and distribute some of that product to other investors across our franchise, and we can also help awm source investments that provide attractive risk adjusted returns to the clients at awm. so there's an opportunity to continue to invest in growing the ﬁnancing capabilities that we've been reporting on, but we also have incremental outlets for the origination excellence given the demand that we see across various types of investors around the market.",4,2024,"so it's really a win-win for both us and our clients, in that we can continue to grow our own business and help our clients access the capital markets in a more efficient and effective way.

The text highlights the importance of origination in driving business growth for the company, particularly in the context of Fixed Income, Currency, and Commodity (FICC) financing. The establishment of a Capital Solutions Group allows for centralized origination, enabling the company to grow the FICC financing balance sheet in a controlled manner and distribute some of the product to other investors within the franchise. Additionally, the group can help Awmarita source investments that offer attractive risk-adjusted returns to clients. This setup benefits both the company and clients by allowing for the growth of the business while providing clients with more efficient and effective access to the capital markets."
0,5,Devin Ryan,,Citizens JMP,question," thanks so much. good morning, david and denis. first question just on the banking and markets, market share, wallet share, obviously , incredibly impressive over the last handful of years. and i think just a testament to the execution. when we look at this kind of new capital solutions organization, it would seemingly better positioned with sponsor clients and just, i think, gives that indication of where you guys are going there. how do you think about your market share today with sponsors and not sure if you can give any framework or numbers there? and then, how you think about the ability to take share in that group and how important that will be to driving further kind of wallet share gains from here like you've done in the past? thanks.",4,2024,"The speaker is asking about the market share and wallet share of the new Capital Solutions organization within the sponsor clients group. The speaker acknowledges the impressive growth in market and wallet share over the last few years and wonders how the new Capital Solutions organization is positioned within this group and how much market share they currently hold. Additionally, the speaker inquires about the potential for further wallet share gains by increasing market share in the sponsor clients group."
1,5,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," yeah. w e -- i mean, we've -- over the last 20 years, we've made enormous investment in our relationships and our coverage and sponsor community . we have leading share with the sponsors. i don't think we quantify it speciﬁcally . but we have - - it's fair to say , we have leading share with sponsor community . i think we're very well positioned as they're active to capture our fair share and even sometimes more than our fair share of that activity . what i'd say is, it's been an environment where they've been incredibly quiet both from a deployment perspective, also a monetization perspective, and that's just not consistent. i've said consistently that sponsors make money by doing two things: buying new things, selling old things. and so the fact that we've gone through a period of time where they haven't done a lot of either of those things, that will normalize over time. part of it was a reset in kind of valuation expectations. some of it was growing into valuation expectations that are kind of run ahead, but i do believe very strongly that the next 24 months will be a much more constructive environment to response to activity . and our share positioning with them is very good. i think these organizational changes will only strengthen that position.",4,2024,"we've also been very intentional over the last year or two to reduce our reliance on sponsor community to the extent that we can. i think we're making good progress in that regard. but i would still say that it's going to be a very important part of our business going forward.

The text suggests that over the last 20 years, the firm has invested significantly in building strong relationships and coverage within the sponsor community. As a result, they hold a leading share within this community. However, the current environment has been quiet from both a deployment and monetization perspective, which is not sustainable. The firm believes that the next 24 months will be a more constructive environment for sponsor activity. Despite efforts to reduce reliance on the sponsor community, it remains an important part of the business going forward."
2,5,Devin Ryan,,Citizens JMP,question," great. thank you. and then, just in terms of on the alternative asset management fundraising has been terriﬁc. how should we think about the pace of deployment of kind of that record fundraising and then just kind of the trajectory of kind of the acceleration in performance fees because it would seem that, that -- there could be a pretty big step function higher in performance fees, but you need to deploy that capital ﬁrst. so just the time line to kind of think through that path. thank you.",4,2024,"The speaker is discussing the strong performance of alternative asset management fundraising. They are questioning the pace of deployment of this new capital and the potential increase in performance fees. The speaker suggests that there could be a significant increase in performance fees due to the record fundraising, but this increase would depend on the timeline for deploying the new capital."
3,5,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, devin. so we're focused on that as well. and it's a good question because it hits a number of topics. so obviously , we had good success raising alts funds and surpassed all the various targets that we set out repeatedly , but now it's an opportunity for us to deploy . and the deal making environment and the transaction volumes moving to the market over the last couple of years being subdued has also impacted our ability to deploy into transaction. so as the overall backdrop improves, that should be a more attractive opportunity for us to start deploying the money that we've raised and drive our aus. at the same time, that same slightly more muted environment for transaction activity has been -- there's been less by way of monetization activity . and so as we, again, enter into, hopefully , a more supportive backdrop, there will be better opportunities for us to continue to monetize investments across our fund structures, and as we reach the end of investment cycles and fully monetize and become in a position to start returning capital to our investors, then you'll see the incentive fees start to come through our ﬁnancials as well. our incentive fees were up sharply on a year-over-year basis, but they're still short of our $1 billion annual target. our expectation is that we will continue to make progress towards that target over the course of 2025, the extent of that progress, obviously , will be a function of the environment, but we should continue to make progress towards the $1 billion target, given where we sit in the outlook that we have.",4,2024,"The text suggests that the company, which specializes in alternative investment funds, had a successful fundraising period but now faces challenges in deploying the raised capital due to subdued transaction volumes. They expect the improving market backdrop to provide more opportunities for deployment and monetization of investments, leading to increased incentive fees. The company's incentive fees were up year-over-year but still short of the $1 billion annual target, and they anticipate making progress towards this target in the coming years."
0,6,Dan Fannon,,Jef feries,question, thanks. good morning. i wanted to follow up on the alternatives. you talked about consistent levels of fundraising as we look at '25. could you maybe talk to the asset classes or the funds that you think will drive that growth going forward and how the fees may be dif ferent or are they the same as kind of what's in the ground of your existing book of alternatives today?,4,2024,"the funds that i think are going to drive growth going forward are private markets. we've seen over the last five or six years a significant shift in investor interest to private markets. as you know, private markets include private equity, real estate, infrastructure, and credit. we've also seen a change in the fee structures for these funds over the last five to ten years.

in private equity, we've seen a shift from a 2 and 20 fee structure to a lower management fee and a performance fee that's based on a hurdle rate. in real estate, we've seen a shift from a net rental income approach to a net asset value approach, and in infrastructure and credit, we've seen a shift to a management fee that's based on the assets under management, rather than a percentage of the returns.

so, the asset classes that we think will drive growth going forward are private markets, and the fee structures for those funds are different than what's in our existing book of alternatives today. in private equity, the fees are lower management fees and performance fees based on a hurdle rate. in real estate, the fees are based on net asset value. in infrastructure and"
1,6,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so given the breadth of our alternatives platform, the fundraising has come in from a number of dif ferent channels has been very diversiﬁed. and i think that's one of the strengths of our platform is one of the ways it positions us as one of the top ﬁve alternative players in the market. so as we move forward, we would continue to expect to raise money across the various asset classes within our alternatives platform. w e are not seeing signiﬁcant fee compressed, if you will. that's a question that we get on the alts side. so we'd expect to be raising the same type of funds with roughly the same fee structure, there obviously can be variations in mix. and so dif ferent types of alts products sourced through dif ferent channels bring with them dif ferent fees. so that can change average ef fective fees in the alts space. but in terms of our strategy , continue to raise a diversiﬁed suite of funds, expect a reasonably consistent volume and don't expect fees per type of origination activity to meaningfully change.",4,2024,"The text suggests that the alternatives platform of the company has been successful in raising funds from various channels, making it one of the top five alternative players in the market. The company is not experiencing significant fee compression and anticipates continuing to raise a diverse range of funds with roughly consistent volume and fees. However, fees may vary depending on the specific alternative product and channel of origination."
2,6,Dan Fannon,,Jef feries,question," understood. and then just as a follow-up, both asset & w ealth management revenues on the management fee side, we saw good growth year-over-year , both for the year and the fourth quarter . there was a little bit higher growth in wealth, both in the fourth quarter and the year . i guess, as you look at those businesses going forward, do you expect to see a divergence in either of those segments or do you think that consistently , they will both grow at similar levels?",4,2024,The speaker is discussing the growth of asset and wealth management revenues for the company. Both segments experienced year-over-year growth in the management fee side for the year and the fourth quarter. Wealth management saw slightly higher growth compared to asset management in both the fourth quarter and the year. The analyst is asking if the company expects to see a divergence in growth between these two segments going forward or if they will continue to grow at similar levels.
3,6,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," so look, there are obviously dif ferent idiosyncratic factors within both the asset management and the wealth management sectors. w e obviously like the optionality to continue to raise and grow our management fees across both of those subsegments. and we re-underwrite our expectation that we will continue to grow awm management and other fees, high-single digits over the next several years. we've obviously outpaced that recently , but we sort of would re-underwrite our forward growth expectations to be high-single digits.",4,2024,"in wealth management, we're continuing to grow our assets under management, which is a great leading indicator, and we're growing market share. we're expanding our distribution network and our product offerings. we're investing in technology, we're investing in talent, we're investing in our brand, and we're investing in our client experience. we believe that that will continue to drive growth in both our asset management and wealth management segments.

A financial analyst would summarize this text as follows:

The speaker expresses confidence in the growth potential of both the Asset Management and Wealth Management sectors within their business. They anticipate a high-single digit increase in management fees for both segments over the next several years. In Wealth Management, they point to the growth in Assets Under Management (AUM) and expanding distribution network as leading indicators of future growth. They also mention investments in technology, talent, brand, and client experience as drivers for continued expansion. Overall, they are optimistic about the future growth prospects for both business segments."
0,7,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," hi, david. hi, denis. david or denis, can you share with us -- i mean, the outlook, many of us -- you folks included, i think, looks very positive for the capital markets businesses, the economy , etc. and aside from the geopolitical risks that are obvious to all of us. can you guys give us two or three risks where could derail this shared optimism we have for the outlook for the business?",4,2024,"i mean, in terms of capital markets, not the macroeconomic. so, david, you want to take the first one? david: sure, denis, you go first. denis: well, i'd say the first risk we see is the potential for a significant correction in the equity markets, particularly in the technology sector. i mean, valuations have been stretched, and there are signs of a slowdown in earnings growth. david: i agree with denis on that. i'd also add that credit spreads have been narrowing, and if there's a sudden increase in credit risk, that could lead to a sell-off in bonds as investors seek safety in cash. david: and a third risk, which is less discussed but could be significant, is the potential for a cyber attack on a major financial institution. not only could that disrupt operations and cause reputational damage, but it could also lead to significant losses if customer data is compromised. denis: absolutely. any questions, david? david: no, i think that covers it. thanks, denis.
The financial analyst should know that according to two experts, David and Denis, there are three risks that could negatively"
1,7,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," i mean the world -- i mean, i appreciate the question, right. the world is a complicated place, and there's a lot going on in the world. markets reacting can change their sentiments very , very quickly . we obviously have a new administration with that change. there are a bunch of things people are talking about that have people excited from a business environment, a lower regulatory touch environment, etc. but at the same point, there are a broad array of policy initiatives that can all have an impact on market sentiment and the direction of travel. and i'd say , at the moment, there's uncertainty . when you look broadly across immigration policy , trade policy , tax policy , energy policy , we'll get more clarity around all of this, but there are dif ferent outcomes. there can be sentiment shifts plus there's a lot going on in the world. and there are all sorts of signiﬁcant risk we spend a lot of time thinking about. w e think about cyber risk a lot. it's something we haven't talked about in a while on this call. so the world is a complicated place. fundamentally , at our core risk managers, we try to think about these things, make sure the ﬁrm is resilient and well positioned to navigate them. and i would say , at the moment, the environment is quite constructive. the economy in the u.s. is quite constructive still. but it's a complicated world. and i think we all should be on our toes and be prepared for the unexpected because i tell you every single year the consensus that people tell me in january , the year turns out to be dif ferent than the consensus. and i'm sure this year , there'll be some surprises to the ups, and there'll be some surprises to the downs as there always are.",4,2024,"The speaker is acknowledging the complexity of the current global political and economic environment, with various policy initiatives under the new administration that could impact market sentiment. There is uncertainty regarding the outcomes of these policies, particularly in areas such as immigration, trade, tax, and energy. The speaker also mentions the risk of cyber attacks as a significant concern. Despite the uncertainty, the speaker believes the economy in the US remains constructive and encourages everyone to be prepared for unexpected events."
2,7,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," yeah. no, i agree with that. that's for sure. thank you, david. and then coming back to, obviously , you guys have been investing heavily in technology for years in driving those operating efﬁciencies. in slide 9, you talk about them, particularly in automation. and then you talk about leveraging the ai solutions. as outsiders, when do you think we'll be able to see the success that you're having with ai. i know there's probably early successes already , but will there become a time when we'll be able to say , wow , earnings were actually favorably impacted by x percent because of the success in the ai implementation that you've done?",4,2024,"The financial analyst is asking when outsiders would be able to see the success of the company's AI implementation in terms of favorably impacting earnings. The company has been investing in technology for years to drive operating efficiencies, specifically mentioning automation and AI solutions. The analyst acknowledges that there may already be early successes but is asking for a clearer indication of the timeline and extent of the impact on earnings."
3,7,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," we are having early success. and this ﬁrm is zealously focused on its expense base and creating efﬁciencies that give us the capacity to invest in our franchise and grow our client franchise. can we get to a point where you can say it's af fected by this percent? i don't necessarily think that's the way to think about it. w e're going to continue to use technology to make the ﬁrm more productive. w e're going to continue to scale and create automation of platforms that allow us to deploy resources and other places will allow us to serve our clients better and grow our franchise. and that's something we're going to continue to be operationally very focused on. we've made good progress on it, but we have -- we see and we have and denis explained this in his comments and i hinted at it too. w e see lots of opportunities to continue to do that in the coming years. and i think the way that investors should look at it and think about it, it's that focus on that and the capacity it creates allows us to scale investments that can continue to strengthen the franchise. and so that's the way i think we think about it and we try to operate.",4,2024,"A financial analyst would summarize this text as follows: The company is experiencing early success and is devoted to managing expenses and generating efficiencies. The cost savings allow the firm to invest in its franchise and expand its client base. While specific percentage targets aren't mentioned, the company will continue to employ technology and automation to boost productivity and better serve clients. The focus on operational improvements enables the firm to allocate resources to strengthen its franchise."
0,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," so i want to talk about how we build towards that medium-term roe target. so obviously , for this quarter was depressed by the write-downs. let's start with a 9-ish starting point. w e know capital markets activity will be better in normal times. so i know we're a lot closer than it looks right now . if you look at page 7, where you spelled out the $3.6 billion of historical principal investments that declined in the quarter or if you want to do it year-to-date either way , my question related to that reducing capital intensity is in a good way , it didn't look like there was a big gain or loss related to those exits. a) is that right? and b) how much capital [r was] (ph) that you free up because i'm just trying to build towards that ultimate goal.",2,2023,"and then let's move on to the business. the non-operating investments in the quarter were about a $1 billion, i think. a lot of that is working capital, but i was hoping you could parse it out a little bit more for us. and then on the operating side, revenue was a little bit disappointing. the oil and gas segment was down. there was a decrease in the average rig count. but i know that's cyclical and the backlog is still strong. there was some disappointment in the automotive segment. and then there's the intangibles that were up a little bit which was a nice surprise. and lastly, on the capex side, it was a little bit lower than expected. but i know that some of that is timing related. i'll ask you a question about that as well.

The speaker is discussing the company's progress towards its medium-term return on equity (ROE) target, which was impacted by write-downs in this quarter. The starting point for ROE is around 9%. The speaker mentions that capital markets activity will improve in normal times and that the company is closer to its target than it may appear. The speaker then asks"
1,0,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so glenn, thank you for the question. and i think in terms of our journey towards our through-the-cycle returns, there are a number of things that we need to do in terms of achieving the top line targets that we laid out at investor day as well as continuing to drive ongoing capital efﬁciency . the capital efﬁciency has been a project that we've been working on for a number of years. w e've had particular increases in those reductions over both the ﬁrst and second quarter . as you know , about hpi down $6 billion. and as we -- if we ultimately reach our target, we expect the total ae reduction to be approximately $9 billion.",2,2023,"w e've made some progress, but we still have a way to go. and as we continue to drive down those costs, we'll be able to reinvest in the business. we'll be able to reinvest in some of the growth areas that we've identified. and i think that's important as we look towards the future. but we also need to continue to grow that top line. we've made some good progress there as well. we've got some new offerings, some new products that are starting to gain traction in the marketplace. and we've got some existing products that continue to perform well. but we need to continue to innovate and bring new products to market. and i think that's important as we look towards the future.

The text discusses a company's efforts to achieve through-cycle returns by focusing on both top line targets and capital efficiency. The company has made progress in reducing costs, with a goal of $9 billion in total cost savings. This cost reduction will allow the company to reinvest in the business and invest in growth areas. However, the company also needs to continue to grow the top line by innovating and bringing new products to market. Existing"
2,0,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. i just -- glenn, i just want to add 2 things, just looking at that because denis has focused on the ae and the continued journey . the one thing he didn't touch on was your question around the reductions and whether there were meaningful marks around that. there are some we’d reduced where -- it might be a public position, so we mark those public positions at market that night and you sell that position at a discount. so there could be a slight loss. there are others that are private positions where you keep a valuation adjustment or a discount to what you believe it's worth as you sell and you get a gain. but i wouldn't say there's anything material that i'd call out in the context of that process. but the important thing about the journey that i'd like to emphasize is we laid out clear in investor day that we were going to narrow the consumer ambitions and really focus on these 2 big businesses. clearly , at this point in time, given the lack of investment banking activity , our investment banking business is performing at a lower level of return and a lower level of activity than we've seen in nearly a decade. w e don't believe that's constant. w e believe that, that global markets and banking business can deliver mid-teens returns through the cycle and that obviously makes up more than 2/3 of the ﬁrm. in addition, marc nachmann laid out at our investor day , a very clear path on asset management to grow the top line of asset management ex the legacy balance sheet by a high single-digit percentage and we set a target to drive the margin which ex the legacy balance sheet up to 25%. at that point, that is a mid-teens return business. and as we continue to narrow the drag which we're making progress on in the platforms and i believe we'll narrow that to 0 and move past that, you've got these 2 businesses that are the ﬁrm that will be mid-teens through the cycle. so that's the way i'd think about it. but obviously , you need a better environment than this environment to see that.",2,2023,"The speaker is clarifying that there were some marks taken on positions during the quarter, but they were not material. The company had previously announced its plans to focus on two core businesses: investment banking and asset management. The investment banking business is currently underperforming, but management believes it can deliver mid-teens returns throughout the cycle. Asset management is expected to grow the top line by a high single-digit percentage and drive margins up to 25%. Once the drag from the platforms is eliminated, these two businesses will deliver mid-teens returns. However, the environment needs to improve for this to be realized."
3,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," i appreciate all that. and maybe one just big picture. think a lot of banks that -- investment banks that have reported over the last couple of days have had varying degrees of optimism about capital markets activity returning. and i think in typical goldman fashion, you all have been i think, appropriately conservative over the last couple of quarters. so maybe i'll just get a mark-to-market on what green shoots you may or may not be seeing. you mentioned your advisory pipeline was up, just kind of contextualize that, that would be great.",2,2023,"so, what deals are you working on? any sectors that are particularly hot right now that you're seeing a lot of activity in? and then what are your thoughts on the m and a market, specifically the technology space, for the rest of the year?

A financial analyst is inquiring about Goldman Sachs' current perspective on the capital markets and specific deals they are working on. The analyst acknowledges that Goldman Sachs has been more conservative compared to other investment banks in recent quarters. The analyst is seeking updates on any positive signs or ""green shoots"" that Goldman Sachs is observing and asking for context on the increase in advisory pipeline. Moreover, the analyst wants to know about the sectors with high activity and Goldman Sachs' thoughts on the M&A market, particularly in the technology sector, for the remainder of the year."
4,0,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. i'd say the following. it deﬁnitely feels better over the course of the last 6 to 8 weeks than it felt earlier in the year . and i've talked in the past on this call and other times when i've talked to many of you about the fact that when you have a big reset, it takes 5 or 6 quarters to get that reset. it's not surprising that we're kind of at 6 quarters now and you're starting to see more activity . so it's deﬁnitely been a pickup in equity capital markets activity . that deﬁnitely feels better . there's more m&a dialogue i can't tell you exactly what the journey is. but when i go back and i look historically at other periods where the macro environment has created sharp drops in investment banking activity , they tend to last for a year or so and then they start to improve. and so i think we're starting to see that here. it deﬁnitely feels better . i think the inﬂation data has been better . the client sentiment is better and now we'll have to watch and see that journey . but i know this activity level of 10-year lows in investment banking activity is not going to be the norm on a forward basis.",2,2023,"it's not a question of if, it's a question of when we'll see more activity.

The text suggests that there has been a noticeable improvement in equity capital markets and M&A activity over the past 6-8 weeks, after a period of low activity. The speaker notes that it usually takes around 6 quarters for the market to recover after a major reset, and they believe that this is where we are currently. The inflation data and client sentiment have also improved, and the speaker is optimistic that this trend will continue. However, they caution that we are currently at 10-year lows in investment banking activity, and this is not expected to be the norm going forward. The question is when, not if, we will see more activity."
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," i guess maybe just the ﬁrst question, when we think about potential for obviously pick up in the back half, david, as you just mentioned but give us a sense of rightsizing the business, given the slowdown that we've seen over the last year or so, -- are we there headcount-wise, infrastructure-wise, where you want it to be on the expense base and as we anchor back to the efﬁciency target around 60%. just give us a sense of how you think we get there and where the where goldman is today in terms of just rightsizing the expense base?",2,2023,"This text is a question asked by a financial analyst to David Solomon, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, during an earnings call. The analyst is asking about Goldman Sachs' potential for growth in the second half of the year and their current status in terms of rightsizing their business, specifically in regards to their headcount, infrastructure, and expense base. The analyst also mentions that Goldman Sachs has an efficiency target of 60%, and they want to know where the company is in relation to reaching that goal."
1,1,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. so i think we've made -- i'll make a couple of comments and denis will probably add on with some more granular detail. but i think we've made progress. w e set out some targets at the beginning of the year . as you heard in denis' prepared remarks, we have them basically accomplished and in line of sight for more. you've seen our noncomp expense ex these extraordinary items around impairments have been down for the second quarter in a row . we've been very focused on that. and there's been real work done there because there's certainly inﬂationary pressure on a bunch of the line items that are noncomp expenses. i think that with hindsight, i'm very glad that we were early in january is starting to work on the headcount sizing. w e took a couple of actions so far this year and we feel good about where we are. i'd remind everybody . and we've said this before that we are resuming our regular performance- based process that we do with compensation at the end of the year which we had stopped during the pandemic and started again next year when we go through compensation, we will do a performance review but we have no other speciﬁc plans on the headcount now . we'll watch the trajectory of revenues in the environment as we go forward. we'll always make adjustments if something changes. but as we just said, we think we're operating an extraordinarily low activities of investment banking. w e're not going to erode that franchise. that is a key franchise of the ﬁrm. so this is a moment that we probably have to support that a little bit more as things recover . we obviously are focused on a bunch of efﬁciency uplift in processes and operations. w e have a big project going on to make some investments that can create more automation and technology and we feel good about that. so we think that over time, that's not a 2023 or early '24 thing but we think over time, that's something else that will beneﬁt the trajectory . denis, do you have some speciﬁcs to add?",2,2023,"The speaker is discussing the progress made towards financial targets set at the beginning of the year. Non-compensation expenses, excluding extraordinary items such as impairments, have decreased for the second consecutive quarter despite inflationary pressure on various line items. The company has been proactive in managing headcount and has resumed the regular performance-based compensation process. The investment bank franchise is a key focus and will be supported as the economy recovers. Efficiency improvements and technology investments are ongoing projects to enhance the business trajectory. No specific headcount plans were announced, but adjustments will be made if necessary based on revenue trends. Denis may have more granular details to add."
2,1,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," i mean just to add for you. so end of the second quarter , we ended -- headcount was 44,600 it’ s down about 2% on the quarter , about 8% year-to-date. i think the more comparable metric is probably the year-over-year metric of down 5% because we'll have new joiners in the third quarter . but as david said, we're happy about taking the action early in the year , positioning the ﬁrm appropriately and also pleased that we’ve been able to reach towards our target of $600 million in run rate payroll efﬁciencies.",2,2023,"This text indicates that as of the end of Q2 2023, the company's headcount was 44,600, a 2% decrease from the previous quarter and an 8% decrease from the same period the previous year. However, the more relevant comparison might be to the year-ago period, which shows a 5% decrease in headcount. The company is content with making these reductions early in the year and achieving their target of $600 million in run rate payroll efficiencies."
3,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," got it. and just maybe a quick follow-up. i think if i heard you correctly , you mentioned goal to maybe step up a pace of buybacks in the back half. just if you could maybe put some numbers around that, what level of buybacks we should expect? and how big a deal is the fed basel npr, from what we're hearing, it may take 6, 12 months before we know what the ﬁnal rules when they incorporate industry feedback look like? so how big of an unknown that is in terms of your capital deployment plans?",2,2023,"The speaker in the text is asking for clarification on the company's plans for increasing the pace of buybacks in the second half of the year and requesting specific numbers. They also inquire about the impact of the Fed's Basel III NPR (New Regulatory Framework) on the company's capital deployment plans, as the final rules may take 6 to 12 months to be determined."
4,1,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so you have pieces of the answer to my question to the question for my answer . so what we would say , obviously , very pleased with the ccar results -- we have 190 basis points of cushion. w e intend to deploy some of that excess capital into the client franchise to continue to grow our activities there. w e announced our increase in dividend. w e've been very committed to sustainably growing our dividend and we're going to increase our level of buybacks. w e are mindful of basel iii revisions but we also recognize that we will get a rule. there will be a comment period for the rule. there will be a period in which that's implemented, some suggestions in the beginning of 2026. that implementation may even have a phase- in period. so as we think about the way in which we manage capital we think we should be optimizing for our client franchise and for our shareholders. we obviously will make sure we're in a position to adopt any new guidance and to do so on time and early -- but in the intervening period, we're going to continue to manage our capital to grow the ﬁrm and to deliver returns of capital to shareholders and we thought we would indicate that, that intention is to step it up from where we are.",2,2023,"The text suggests that the bank is pleased with its CET1 capital results, which provide a cushion of 190 basis points. The bank intends to deploy some of this excess capital into its client franchise to continue growing its business. The bank also announced an increase in its dividend, reflecting its commitment to sustainable growth. Buybacks will also increase. The bank is aware of the Basel III revisions but will wait for the rule and implementation details before adjusting its capital management strategy. In the meantime, the bank plans to optimize capital for its client franchise and shareholders, continuing to grow the firm and return capital to shareholders. The bank intends to increase the pace of returning capital to shareholders."
0,2,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," david, there's been a fair amount of price speculation covering how you’re -- the consumer business, speciﬁcally even some recently suggesting you might look to sell some additional receivables tied to partnership with apple and gm. i know price speculation might not be representative of what's actually being discussed. so it might be helpful just to hear about your strategic priorities for the consumer business, maybe how your vision has evolved in recent months just given some of the challenges facing that business and maybe not ﬁtting with your -- aligning with your core competencies.",2,2023,"The text suggests that there have been discussions about David's consumer business and the possibility of selling additional receivables related to partnerships with Apple and GM. However, it's important to note that these discussions may not be reflective of David's actual strategic priorities for the consumer business. The analyst is asking David to clarify his strategic priorities and how his vision for the consumer business has evolved in light of recent challenges and potential misalignment with core competencies."
1,2,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. so thanks for the question. and i frame it this way . as i think you know , we made difﬁcult but appropriate decision over a year ago, working with our board to narrow our consumer ambitions and kind of rolled out the fall, the direction of travel and have been executing on that. and that included the wind down and the execution of the markets the wind down of the execution of the sale of the marcus loan portfolio which has now been completed and obviously exploring options for greensky which we've been transparent on are in the process of. w e've also said very clearly that our credit card partnerships are long-term partnerships. w e don't have unilateral rights with them. they deﬁnitely can operate better . we've been working hard to improve the operation of them which will reduce the drag and we're making good progress on that. and we're working with apple and also with gm to do that. and so there's a signiﬁcant focus on reducing that drag. and the drag of those credit card partnerships has gotten smaller and it will continue to be reduced as we move forward into 2024. we continue to have a very strong deposit platform. w e launched an apple savings platform which also was a successful launch to grow our deposit base. and so we'll continue to grow deposits and that's the course that we're on at the moment.",2,2023,The speaker is discussing the company's decision to narrow its consumer ambitions and the progress made in executing that plan. They have completed the sale of the Marcus loan portfolio and are exploring options for Greensky. Credit card partnerships are long-term and the company is working to improve their operation to reduce the drag. The drag of these partnerships has been reducing and will continue to do so into 2024. The company has a strong deposit platform and has launched an Apple savings platform to grow deposits.
2,2,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," it's great color . maybe just for my follow-up on equity ﬁnancing speciﬁcally . the contribution in the ﬁrst half actually implies an incremental $1 billion in fees year-on- year. you've deﬁnitely been highlighting the commitment to grow the ﬁnancing piece. and just wanted to better understand, one, the durability of the gains that you saw in the ﬁrst half and as we look out over the next few years, how signiﬁcant of a contribution to the trading business do you expect from the ﬁnancing component both across equities as well as fic?",2,2023,"To summarize for a financial analyst, the text suggests that in the first half of the year, there was a significant increase of $1 billion in fees from equity financing. The speaker acknowledges the company's commitment to growing the financing piece and wants to understand the durability of these gains and the expected contribution of financing to the trading business in the coming years, specifically for both equities and fixed income (FIC)."
3,2,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," so i'm going to start with a high-level just strategic view of what i think we've done and we're focused on doing and then denis will give you a little bit more detail. but 1 of the things -- this has been a strategic priority for us because i certainly remember going back over the last decade, there were times where we did not have the largest equity business and we were not in a position with our clients and the equity franchise that we're in now . and there were some reasons based on strategic decisions that we made at the time. but we've been very focused over the last decade in improving that position and have made good progress and growing the ﬁnancing franchise and also expanding the base of clients that we worked with there has made a real dif ference. and so, i look at the equities performance this quarter and feel very good about it; very good about what the team has accomplished and very good about the feedback we get from clients. now broadly , that ﬁnancing revenue is more durable than intermediation revenue but it obviously is af fected by risk on, risk of f and overall market level activities. and so there can be variability in it but there's a base stability there that's much more meaningful than intermediation revenues. denis can expand a little bit more on how we think about that from a risk and a capital perspective.",2,2023,"but from a strategic perspective, i feel good about where we are and i think we're well positioned to continue growing the business and expanding our client base.

The speaker in this text is discussing the strategic priorities of their firm, specifically focusing on the growth of their equity business and financing franchise. They mention that in the past, the firm did not have the largest equity business and that this was due to strategic decisions made at the time. However, over the last decade, there has been a focus on improving this position and expanding the client base in the equity franchise. This has made a significant difference, and the speaker feels good about the progress made and the feedback from clients.

The speaker also notes that financing revenue is more durable than intermediation revenue, but it can still be affected by overall market conditions. They acknowledge that there can be variability in financing revenue, but there is a base stability that is more meaningful than intermediation revenues. The speaker expresses confidence in the firm's strategic position and its ability to continue growing the business and expanding the client base. Denis will provide more detail on the risk and capital perspective related to financing revenue."
4,2,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so that is the strategic direction of travel. w e are allocating a lot of time and resources, human capital, ﬁnancial capital to grow those activities equities ﬁnancing revenues are nearly 50% of overall equities revenue this quarter and that's something that has been growing. even the combined fic and equities ﬁnancing as a percentage of pick and equities continue to grow . so remain very focused on prioritizing activities in that space with clients. and we're also observing that there's a virtuous reinforcement of our commitments to grow market share and to cover clients more holistically over a multiyear period. it's paying dividends both across dividend and intermediation and recognizing david's comments with respect to market valuation levels which drive changes in balances and changes in behavior , there's also activities that we've been taking to sort of systematically identify components of the client base across the ﬁnancing activities and make sure that we're capturing more share in underpenetrated portions of the client base. so remain committed to growing that activity . it's relatively more durable than intermediation but like other line items, it can ﬂuctuate on the forward.",2,2023,"The text indicates that the company is focusing a significant amount of resources on growing its equities financing revenue, which currently accounts for nearly half of its equities revenue. This growth has been ongoing and is expected to continue, with a focus on prioritizing activities in this area with clients. The company is also seeing a virtuous cycle of growth in market share and holistic client coverage, which is benefiting both dividend and intermediation activities. The company is systematically identifying underpenetrated portions of the client base in financing activities and working to capture more share in those areas. Overall, equities financing is a relatively more durable revenue line item than intermediation, but it can still fluctuate in the future."
0,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," just one follow-up to that last question and then a dif ferent one. but just on the last question. so you mentioned durability when you were talking about ﬁnancing, that was part of what i wanted to understand. do you feel like this quarter of ﬁnancing revenue is a good jump of f point for us to grow from. and if there's any puts and takes on how you would think -- how would you want us to think about that level of durability , that would be helpful.",2,2023,The speaker is a financial analyst and they are asking about the durability of the financing revenue from the previous quarter. They want to know if this level of revenue is a good starting point for growth and if there are any pros and cons to consider regarding this level of durability.
1,3,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so i'll comment both on ficc and equities. in ﬁxed income, we had slightly softer performance over period-on-period. that was driven by a component of ﬁxed ﬁnancing which is more episodic which is commodities-based ﬁnancing, those activity levels were a lot higher . and so i think you see lack of contribution from commodities-based ﬁnancing activity that was in prior periods but i think the forward for other components of our ﬁxed ﬁnancing, like collateralized lending and repo, i think there remains opportunity for us to deploy and continue to grow those types of activities. i'm always cautious about predicting growth of f of record performance. we're pleased with the equities ﬁnancing performance in the second quarter and we do intend to grow that from here but we'll have to continue to work hard to continue to deliver the type of period-over-period growth but we do think there is still unaddressed market share and we continue to grow our balances to grow those revenues.",2,2023,"i'll add that while the equities business had a solid quarter, the revenue growth there was not as robust as some of the other areas of our business, like fixed income trading and investment management, so it was a good quarter but not a standout quarter.

The speaker is discussing the performance of their company in both fixed income and equities financing. In fixed income, there was slightly weaker performance due to a higher level of commodities-based financing in prior periods that did not contribute in the recent period. However, there is still potential for growth in other components of fixed financing such as collateralized lending and repo. In equities financing, the company had a solid performance in the second quarter and intends to grow that business going forward. However, the revenue growth in equities financing was not as strong as some of the other areas of the business like fixed income trading and investment management."
2,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," and you highlighted capital obviously have excess, signiﬁcant excess. so there's that ﬂex between buybacks versus deploy . this is an opportunity to deploy . i guess the follow-up i had to that was in your comments earlier on the basel iii end game. i think you mentioned that you -- look, you're in a position to be opportunistic, whether or not you want to meet the requirements early . and i guess that was the question i had on when you say on time, of course but early just meaning within that phase-in period early . and again, i kind of asked the question with the context of you've got this opportunity in ﬁnancing. so how should i think through meeting it early versus leaning into ﬁnancing versus other options you might have.",2,2023,"The speaker is discussing the excess capital that Company A has and the opportunity to deploy that capital. They are in a position to be opportunistic with their capital and can choose to meet the requirements of Basel III, a banking regulation, early or lean into financing options. The speaker is questioning the analyst's thoughts on whether Company A should meet the Basel III requirements early or delay and deploy the excess capital into financing opportunities. The phase-in period refers to the time frame given for companies to comply with the new regulations. The analyst is asking for the analyst's perspective on the trade-off between meeting the requirements early and deploying capital into financing opportunities."
3,3,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes, betsy . so look, i appreciate that. i think there's a lot that's unknown about the direction of travel on this. and we're talking about years out. and so i think denis' message on early was in the context of the phase-in period, making sure we were getting there on time. but no, we are focused on deploying -- we generate a lot of capital because the ﬁrm generally through the cycle generates good earnings. w e are going to return a bunch of that to shareholders and there are opportunities as we're talking about to deploy that in service of plants. given the work we've done strategically , we now have much greater ﬂexibility which gives us the option to look sharply as some of the deployment opportunities where maybe 6 to 12 months ago, we felt we needed to be more cautious. and at the same point, we have more capacity , as denis said, to step up buybacks. you should view that we're very , very focused on delivering capital to serve clients and to shareholders and we'll be very thoughtful about the adjustment phase in of whatever comes when we understand it. but i'd just say there's a lot of uncertainty . it's a ways out; there's going to be comment periods. and so there's nothing going to be premature about what we do.",2,2023,"but we will be deploying capital in service of growth opportunities as they arise.

In this text, the speaker is addressing concerns about the company's focus on returning capital to shareholders and investing in new plants. The speaker acknowledges that there is uncertainty regarding the direction of travel for regulatory issues and the phase-in period, but assures that they are focused on deploying capital for growth opportunities as they arise. The company has greater flexibility due to strategic work and a stronger financial position, allowing them to consider more deployment opportunities and increase buybacks. They will be thoughtful in their adjustments and will prioritize delivering capital to clients and shareholders. Overall, the company plans to remain focused on capital deployment for growth and will be prepared for regulatory adjustments when they are better understood."
0,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question," look, i think you described here the rightsizing with investment equity debt cie, the consumer and with head count is what were any [indiscernible] and where are you on the rightsizing of headcount? and the big picture question for david is simply , is this as bad as it gets? do you feel comfortable that you captured everything with any severance to marches to greensky to cie with debt investment -- debt equity investment and that you were conservative enough? are we going to keep seeing 9% roes or does this accelerate your journey to that 15% midterm roe?",2,2023,"A financial analyst is inquiring about the status of rightsizing efforts, specifically regarding headcount, at Investment Equity Debt CIE (a company). They want to know if any other significant costs or issues have arisen since the announcement of the rightsizing and whether the company has been conservative in its approach. The analyst is also interested in the potential impact on the company's return on equity (ROE), with a focus on whether the current 9% ROE will continue or if there will be an acceleration towards the midterm goal of 15%."
1,4,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," okay . mike, it's denis. i'll start and then i'll turn it over to david. so we called out our severance expense year-to-date was $260 million the vast majority of that was in the ﬁrst quarter in connection with much, much larger levels of headcount reductions then. the reason that we're making an ef fort to call it out, you will also notice that our comp ratio net of business at 34%. w e're just making an ef fort to provide transparency in terms of what components of our compensation expense accruals are designed for severance. and we think that's important because with the balance - - we're going to be focused on our pay-for-performance ethos as well as balancing returns for shareholders but making sure that we have the capacity this year to protect our talent, protect the franchise, make sure we're positioned to capture the upside. so, the severance disclosures are just designed to help understand the ﬁnancial impact of the actions we've taken david will give you more color but we've largely done what we set out to do. w e're on target for the payroll efﬁciencies and that i'll help you understand what the severance picture is relative to the overall accrued level of compensation and expense.",2,2023,"The company, Denis, is reporting that year-to-date severance expenses were $260 million, with the majority of that expense occurring in the first quarter. They are providing transparency on the compensation expense accruals related to severance to help investors understand the financial impact of the company's actions. The company has focused on its pay-for-performance ethos while also prioritizing protecting talent, the franchise, and positioning themselves to capture upside. They are on track for payroll efficiencies. David will provide more details on the severance picture relative to the overall accrued compensation and expense."
2,4,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," and mike, to your bigger question, this was a meaningful quarter of putting some things that we strategically decided to do behind us. with respect to the balance sheet, i think one of the things that's very important to call out, this is an environment at the moment that's been hard on that legacy balance sheet. w e are reducing the legacy balance sheet but we could just as well next quarter , if the environment improves, of positive revenues from that legacy balance sheet too. but if the environment got worse, we still have balance sheet to reduce. so i've been around the ﬁrm a long time. this was obviously a tough quarter but we also had one-of f items that we put in. w e're going to continue to give you transparency on the legacy balance sheet and we're going to continue to move forward. i think the environment feels better , if the environment feels better and the environment turns out to be better , you'll see better performance. but i feel very , very good about the strategic decisions that we're making, the execution that we're working on, the progress we're making in asset and wealth management and we as a leadership team see a clear path to improvement in a better operating environment.",2,2023,"The CEO of the company is discussing the recent quarter's financial results and addressing the larger question about the legacy balance sheet. The CEO acknowledges that the legacy balance sheet has been negatively impacted in the current environment but emphasizes that they are actively working to reduce it. If the environment improves, the balance sheet could even generate positive revenues. However, if the environment worsens, the reduction process will continue. The CEO also mentions that there were one-time items in the quarter and that they will continue to provide transparency regarding the legacy balance sheet. The CEO expresses confidence in the strategic decisions being made and the progress being made in asset and wealth management. They believe there is a clear path to improvement in a better operating environment."
3,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question, and can you remind us -- so you're taking this pain the charges and you're looking to get to mid-teens roe in the medium term. how do you deﬁne medium term? and what should we be looking at along the way because to the extent that this accelerates this transition. it'd be nice to see some metrics externally for that progress?,2,2023,"could you also remind us what the potential impact of these investments on the tax rate might be?
The speaker is discussing plans to reduce pain points and increase ROTE (Return on Total Equity) to the mid-teens in the medium term. The medium term is not explicitly defined, but it can be assumed to be a period longer than the short term but not as long as the long term. To monitor progress towards this goal, investors should look for external metrics that indicate the acceleration of the transition. The speaker also mentions that there could be potential impacts on the tax rate due to these investments."
4,4,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, we're going to make progress, mike, over the next couple of years, the next 2 to 3 years, we're going to make meaningful progress. but i'd just highlight, when you go back to our core business, banking and markets, where we are a leader and i think given the mix of that business is performing well and what's not a perfect environment for that business, if that business, we really believe will deliver mid- teens through the cycle. the investment banking returns right now are at a very , very signiﬁcant low but we do have a 14% roe to date in global banking and markets. so an improved environment should help us. the asset management journey is going to take and we were very clear about this in february , it's going to take 2 to 3 more years for us to continue to make progress on the journey with respect to the continued reduction of the balance sheet and the revenue growth and the margin uplift. and we're working on it. w e see a clear line of sight and we're going to make progress.",2,2023,"but it's a different journey than the banking and markets journey. the insurance business, we're very clear, we're going to be patient with respect to that business. we're going to see improvement in that business over the long term and we're going to invest in that business. we'll see improvement in that business over the long term.

The text suggests that the company's core business, banking and markets, is expected to deliver mid-teens return on equity (ROE) through the cycle. However, investment banking returns are currently at a significant low. The asset management journey is predicted to take 2 to 3 more years for continued reduction of the balance sheet, revenue growth, and margin uplift. The insurance business will see improvement over the long term, and the company will be patient and invest in it."
0,5,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," you spoke earlier to green shoots that you're seeing in the banking side given how important sponsors are to your banking franchise, curious to drill down and speciﬁcally understand what you're seeing with that cohort and whether or not we need to see the levered loan market recover before they can come back in full force?",2,2023,"In response to the question, the speaker is indicating that they have noticed signs of improvement in the banking sector, particularly with regard to sponsors. They are curious to explore this topic further and understand more specifically what these ""green shoots"" entail. The speaker is also asking whether the recovery of the leveraged loan market is a necessary condition for sponsors to return in full force. In essence, the speaker is seeking more information on the current state of the sponsor market within the banking sector and its potential relationship to the leveraged loan market."
1,5,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. so thanks for that question, brennan. it's a good question. it's an important thing. i'm glad you're asking us to highlight it because i think about it this way and it's very, very important. when you look at our m&a  business, a signiﬁcant contributor to our m&a  business is m&a  responses and that's come to a halt. it's come to a halt. there are 2 aspects of it. there's buy side and the sell side. the buy side obviously also give us ﬁnancing and other capital markets activity . the sell side sometimes gives staple and ﬁnancing opportunity , too but that stuf f has kind of come to a hall. here's one thing i know about ﬁnancial sponsors. number one, they own a bunch of assets. they're all for sale and they all will be sold. this environment has slowed down the pace of sale in a better environment that will accelerate. and i think we're going to see that accelerate as we look forward from here. this has been a particularly slow environment for that. secondly , they have enormous dry powder , okay? and they can't make money unless they deploy . and so as soon as you get to a place, the values reset and ﬁnancing costs are understood, you start to see people deploy . we're starting to see some of that. you saw this quarter , obviously , a very , very big transaction around fis. and so you're going, i think [indiscernible] as we move forward. so this is a very , very important part of the investment banking ecosystem that kind of came to a shutdown given the volatility of change in the environment. and i'm not smart enough to tell you this quarter , next quarter but it will meaningfully improve and it's an important component to investment banking activity . and it's one of the reasons why investment in banking activity is running at kind of from an activity level, kind of 10-year lows. and the other part of your question, brennan, speaks to availability and health of ﬁnancing markets. i think we certainly have underwriting appetite to facilitate these transactions. w e believe we can distribute risk into the market. there's also a number of principal in buckets, both with our clients and within our own funds that are capable of deploying ﬁnancing to support transaction activity in this environment that could also be an attractive source of activity for the ﬁrm.",2,2023,"so from that perspective, i think we're well-positioned as we move forward. and that's my answer to your question. here's the summary for a financial analyst: The speaker discusses the impact of the current market environment on M&A activity, specifically the slowdown in sell-side and buy-side transactions. Financial sponsors, who are significant contributors to M&A business, own assets that are all for sale and have enormous dry powder. Once values reset and financing costs are understood, they will start to deploy capital and transaction activity is expected to pick up. The investment banking ecosystem has been affected by this slowdown and investment banking activity is running at 10-year lows. Despite this, underwriting appetite remains and the firm is well-positioned to facilitate transactions with its clients and its own funds."
2,5,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," great, i appreciate it. and then for my second, you started the process of selling greensky . we saw the goodwill impairment. what's been the reception to that asset? and has that impacted your expectation for how quickly you could ﬁnalize that sale?",2,2023,"The text appears to be part of a conversation between two individuals, possibly a financial analyst and a company executive. The first topic discussed was the goodwill impairment charge related to Greensky, an asset or business unit of the company. The executive did not provide any specific information regarding the reception to the asset or how it has affected the expected timeline for the sale. Therefore, a summary for a financial analyst might look like this:

The executive provided an update on the progress of selling the Greensky asset and mentioned the goodwill impairment charge related to it. However, no details were given regarding the reception to the asset or its impact on the expected sale timeline."
3,5,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," brennan, in terms of the process, we're obviously in the middle of the process. w e have feedback. i think extra color , just to share with you in terms of how you think about potential on the forward. it's a business we bought for $1.7 billion. w e integrated into goldman sachs. w e're seeing it perform well. it's a good business. we had made the decision to explore alternatives because it's not the right ﬁt necessarily for goldman sachs. w e've written down the goodwill in the consumer platform segment. there's no more goodwill to be written down. that business at this point has remaining unamortized intangibles approximately $625 million that we consider for impairment on a quarterly basis and we'll do so in the future. and should we move forward with the transaction with respect to greensky , it could happen in a number of dif ferent ways. w e could sell the platform, we could sell the platform and the historical lending book that we have on balance sheet. and should we choose to sell the loan book, we'll designate that as held for sale, much like the marcus loans process and you'll see the p&l  impact accordingly as we mark the loans and release the associated reserve. so those are the types of things that could occur on the forward given the strategic activity but i don't think there's anything else to say about the greensky process given where we are.",2,2023,"The text discusses the current status of the Greensky business, which was acquired by Goldman Sachs for $1.7 billion. The business has been integrated into Goldman Sachs and is performing well. However, it was determined that it may not be the best fit for the company, and alternatives are being explored. The goodwill in the consumer platform segment has already been written down, and there is remaining unamortized intangible assets of approximately $625 million. If a transaction with Greensky were to move forward, it could involve selling the platform or the platform and historical lending book. If the loan book is sold, it would be designated as held for sale and the p&l impact would be recognized accordingly. The speaker does not believe there is anything else significant to report about the Greensky process at this time.

In summary, Goldman Sachs acquired Greensky for $1.7 billion and integrated it into the company. However, it has been determined that the business may not be the best fit, and alternatives are being explored. The goodwill in the consumer platform segment has been written down, and there is remaining unamortized intangible assets of $625"
0,6,Devin Ryan,,JMP  Securities,question," in markets we hit on ﬁnancing. so i just want to look at intermediation here. and obviously , results were of f quite a bit from a great quarter last year . but based on the results, it also looks like you did better than the implication on the conference circuit late in the quarter . so just the implication there would be that june got a lot better for intermediation. so i just want to make sure kind of that read is correct. and then did june feel like a more normal month relative to the ﬁrst couple? and has that continued? just trying to think about the quarter and the cadence there?",2,2023,The speaker in this text is discussing the results of a financial quarter for intermediation in the markets. They mention that the results were not as great as the previous year but better than what was implied during the conference circuit late in the quarter. The speaker also notes that June seemed to have improved significantly for intermediation. They want to confirm that this interpretation is correct and ask if June felt more normal compared to the first couple of months and if this trend has continued.
1,6,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. so thanks, kevin. i'd just say and you highlighted this appropriately , just pointing back. i mean, one of the big dif ferences when you look at the year-over-year comparison is we're coming out of the period where the word started in russia and there was an enormous activity in the commodity space. and we were very , very well positioned to serve clients in that space. and so we -- if you go back and you look at the second quarter 2022, we way outperformed in that quarter because of that commodities activity and obviously didn't have that here. i think to the second part of your comment, yes, june was better . june was deﬁnitely better . and so there was an improvement in tone and a little bit of improvement in risk on and what we're early in the quarter . but there's no question, there's more of a risk on sentiment in the month of july than it was earlier in the second quarter . and you just think about it, we're coming out of march, we were coming out of the banking crisis and you think about when we were on this call in early april, we're in a very dif ferent place in terms of investor sentiment overall. so there has been an improvement through the quarter . and i think it's noted appropriately .",2,2023,"but again, we're very mindful of the fact that we're coming out of a very difficult period and there's still a lot of uncertainty out there. so I think it's important for us to continue to be cautious and to continue to manage our risk carefully.

The speaker acknowledges that the year-over-year comparison shows underperformance due to the strong commodity activity in the previous year, particularly in the second quarter of 2022. They note that June showed improvement, with a better tone and a return of risk-on sentiment. However, the speaker also recognizes that there is still more risk-on sentiment in July compared to earlier in the second quarter. They emphasize the importance of continuing to manage risk carefully due to the uncertainty that still exists following the difficult period in March, when there was a banking crisis."
2,6,Devin Ryan,,JMP  Securities,question," okay , that's great. and then just on transaction banking and the momentum there, be great to just get an update on some of the kind of the drivers. and really , the question is, it's such a huge market as you guys identiﬁed when you got the business. it's still a very small driver for goldman. and so just trying to think about the growth there? and are there opportunities for more step function growth if you add a certain capability? or just how should we think about the opportunity to really -- this to become a much bigger business for goldman?",2,2023,The speaker is asking for an update on the transaction banking business at Goldman Sachs and wants to know more about the drivers of growth in this area. They acknowledge that the transaction banking market is large and that Goldman's involvement is currently small. The speaker is interested in understanding if there are opportunities for significant growth by adding new capabilities to the business. They are looking for insights into how Goldman might increase the size of this business and become a larger player in the transaction banking market.
3,6,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," so i appreciate that question. i think it's -- i think you're right. i think we've got an interesting platform. it's been very constructive in bringing deposits to goldman sachs. but one of the things that we said over the last couple of quarters is we're working now on getting the clients that are on the platform to really get more of their payments activity into the ﬂow , so this delivers real revenue and real value over time, that's taking some time and it will take some time. i think it's a dispersed business where there are lots of providers for most people. these are our clients, so we have the right to kind of compete for and be engaged for this. they like our technology but making changes in payment ﬂows takes time. so i think the team here is very focused on the long-term investment in building those relationships. i think a particular opportunity for us is around what i call kind of ﬁnancial sponsor companies, etcetera. w e're obviously given our ﬁnancial sponsors franchise. w e have a very , very good opportunity set over time. but this is going to take time to execute. i think it's one of those things where we have a business that's performing ﬁne but it's not making a meaningful contribution. but i think this is something where, over time, we'll work hard to ﬁgure out how this can make a more meaningful contribution to the ﬁrm with our client base.",2,2023,"and obviously we're working on it very hard. so that's kind of the update on that.

The text is discussing Goldman Sachs' digital platform that has been successful in bringing deposits to the company. However, the focus now is on getting clients on the platform to move more of their payment activity through it to generate revenue. This process is taking time, and Goldman Sachs is competing with other providers for these clients. The company sees an opportunity with financial sponsor companies and is investing in building relationships with them to make the platform more valuable over time. The business is currently performing well but not making a significant contribution to the firm. Goldman Sachs is working hard to figure out how the platform can make a more meaningful contribution in the future."
0,7,Daniel Fannon,,Jef feries,question," i wanted to ask about private banking and lending, even ex the $100 million gain this quarter . that continues to be an area of growth. can you talk about the prospects as we think about going forward and the inputs to kind of continue the lower growth you've seen?",2,2023,"A financial analyst is inquiring about the prospects of private banking and lending, beyond the $100 million gain recorded in the current quarter. The analyst is interested in understanding how the bank plans to sustain the lower growth rate observed in this area. No specific information has been provided in the text regarding the current state or future prospects of private banking and lending, aside from the mention of the $100 million gain and the need to discuss inputs for sustaining lower growth."
1,7,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so it's highlighted as one of those areas within the overall asset & w ealth management business which we think has the combined beneﬁt of growth opportunities as well as more stable and recurring revenues, there's a couple of components inside of that line item. w e've obviously seen strong growth in the deposit platform which has been contributing nicely and that was the area in which we had our marcus loans activities which on the for those will obviously have -- will not be contributing on the forward. but the other piece of it which is an area of strategic priority for us is the overall activities with respect to wealth lending activities. and we have, as i think david highlighted earlier , premium ultra-high net worth business that has been growing nicely . but we feel like we're relatively underpenetrated with respect to some of the lending activities with those clients and across the wealth space. and so we have some new leadership across the division in the past number of quarters and a very , very clear mandate that we should be out there aggressively leaning into those relationships and making sure that we can solidify them as comprehensively as possible and we expect that will be a contributor to that line item as well on the forward.",2,2023,"This text discusses the growth opportunities and stable revenues in the Asset & Wealth Management business, specifically in the area of deposit platform and wealth lending activities. The deposit platform has seen strong growth, but the Marcus loans activities, which contributed to this growth, will not be a factor moving forward. Instead, the focus is on wealth lending activities, particularly for premium ultra-high net worth clients, where the bank feels underpenetrated. The bank has new leadership in place with a clear mandate to aggressively pursue relationships and offer comprehensive services, which is expected to contribute to the growth of this line item."
2,7,Daniel Fannon,,Jef feries,question," great. and then just as a follow-up, in terms of the balance sheet reduction outlook and as you think about line of sight which i think you used to give us some numbers and given capital markets may be opening up and a little bit more receptive to exit anything that you could point to or numerically talk about in the short term that you're planning on or have as i said, line of sight on?",2,2023,"The speaker is asking for an update on the company's balance sheet reduction outlook and if there are any specific short-term plans for exiting certain assets or reducing debt. The analyst may be referring to previous discussions where specific numbers were mentioned, and is asking for an update on those plans with the current market conditions improving."
3,7,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. i appreciate that question. so obviously , we took you to current on historical principal investments at 23.8%. you know that there is a year-end '24 target of below $15 billion. w e said we are well on pace towards that target. i would say that we have line of sight on several billion of incremental reductions. w e have a large number of processes and positions that we're exploring for disposition. they're all in various stages of completeness from exclusivity to on of fer to being marketed to being prepared. w e've moved a large number of positions year-to-date and we have more that we're focused on moving from here. so i would of fer that up as it's an ongoing highly engaged process where we expect to make incremental progress.",2,2023,"In this text, the speaker is discussing the progress towards reducing the company's principal investments below $15 billion by the end of 2024. They indicate that they are ""well on pace"" towards this target and have identified several billion dollars worth of positions for disposition. These positions are in various stages of the sell process, with some already moved and others still being prepared. The speaker emphasizes that this is an ongoing process and that incremental progress is expected."
0,8,Matt O'Connor,,Deutsche Bank,question," so the scb obviously came down very nicely this year and has been trending down for a couple of years now . we are getting some questions on how some of the consumer loan portfolios have impacted that. and speciﬁcally with the sale of the marcus loans and potentially sale of greensky loans and again, according to the media, potentially exit the credit card. i guess the question is, do those loans actually help bring down the scb? or what are the puts and takes there as you think about the impact of those loan portfolios in aggregate on the annual f aca.",2,2023,"The text discusses the SCB (Stablecoat Bank) having a nice decline in costs this year and trending down for a couple of years. There are inquiries regarding the influence of consumer loan portfolios, specifically the sale of Marcus loans and potentially Greensky loans, as well as the media speculation of an exit from the credit card business. The financial analyst is seeking to understand if these loans help reduce the SCB costs or what the pros and cons are regarding the impact of these loan portfolios on the annual net charge."
1,8,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so look, you're familiar with the process as we are. there's various levels of transparency that you get through the process. obviously , those contributions from lending activities which roll into components of the test. but the big driver for us and what we feel has been enabling us to meaningfully move down our scb towards the 5% area that we've been discussing is really attributable to the on-balance sheet investments. w e think that has a very , very meaningful impact for us. and the thing i would remind you is that the impact that was just revealed in this year's test with this scb of 5.5% due to be implemented in october , that's based on the snapshot of activity that the fed took last year which means that all the activities that we're discussing on this call are going to be considered in the next test. and assuming that the test is similar next year to the test this year which i don't know . but if it is, we will continue to see beneﬁt from our reduction of these on balance sheet investments. so the reason why we remain so focused on setting those targets and providing so much transparency about our trajectory and our path is that we really believe that, that's a very , very meaningful way to understand our trajectory in terms of minimum capital ratios until, obviously , any new news on that front.",2,2023,"A financial analyst is being informed by a company representative that the company's Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) has been improving due to the reduction of on-balance sheet investments. The SLR measures a bank's ability to absorb unexpected losses by comparing its total leverage to its Tier 1 capital. The representative explains that the company's focus on reducing on-balance sheet investments has been a significant factor in the improvement of its SLR, which has been enabling the company to move closer to the 5% target. The representative also notes that the impact of the company's on-balance sheet investment reductions was only recently reflected in the most recent SLR test, and that these reductions will continue to positively impact the company's SLR in future tests. The company is providing transparency about its progress towards the 5% target to help investors understand its trajectory towards meeting regulatory requirements."
2,8,Matt O'Connor,,Deutsche Bank,question, okay . so focus much more on the legacy on balance sheet positions versus the consumer lending portfolios?,2,2023,"I think that's what I'm hearing you say. So, in terms of the legacy positions, you're talking about the non-performing assets and the provisions for loan losses, correct? And you're saying that those are the areas of greater concern for you at this point?

Yes, that's correct. The legacy positions on our balance sheet, specifically the non-performing assets and the provisions for loan losses, are the areas of greater concern for us at this point. While our consumer lending portfolios are performing well, we believe it is important to focus on managing these legacy positions effectively in order to mitigate potential risks and ensure regulatory compliance.

Additionally, we are continuing to make progress on our efforts to reduce the size and risk profile of these legacy positions through various means such as sales, transfers, and workouts. However, given the complexity and uncertainty associated with some of these positions, it is a ongoing process that requires careful attention and resources.

So, in summary, while our consumer lending portfolios are performing well, we are focusing more on managing the risks associated with our legacy positions on the balance sheet, specifically non-performing assets and provisions for loan losses. We"

0,9,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC Capital Markets,question," david, in your opening comments, you were talking about you guys are still very focused on reaching a mid-teens roe through the cycle. w e all know the business has been depressed as you pointed out in your comments. can you share with us, if you go -- we have -- the public has access to the geologic data your data is probably better than that. but if you look at the geologic data for '21 and '22, obviously , global investment banking revenues were unusually strong. why would you think is a normal level for global investment banking revenues that you need to get to that mid- teens roe that you're targeting?",2,2023,"In this text, David is discussing the company's focus on achieving a mid-teens return on equity (ROE) despite the current depressed business environment. The analyst is questioning David about the basis for assuming a normal level of global investment banking revenues to reach the mid-teens ROE target. David's comments suggest that the geologic data, which is likely an indication of market conditions for investment banking revenues, was unusually strong in 2021 and 2022. The analyst is asking David to explain why these revenue levels are considered normal and necessary to reach the targeted ROE."
1,9,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," so again, i'd highlight that global banking and markets, even in this environment, has close to 14% roe for the ﬁrst 6 months of the year in what's not a great environment for investment banking. w e don't disclose the separate roe for investment banking but i just highlight to you, it's running way , way below what it's run on average over the course of the last 5 in the last 10 years. w e do not have to go back to 2021 kind of levels in order to see a material uplift in that investment banking roe which would bolster the overall through-the-cycle uplift of our global banking and markets franchise. i'm sure in my lifetime, maybe not my career , i'll see another year like 2021 but 2021 falls into that category of years that come along once in a decade, i wouldn't call that normal either . but i would say that this is not normal and normalize somewhere in between. our average, i hate the word normal, average lies somewhere in between.",2,2023,"and i think that's where we'll find ourselves over the course of the next 2 to 3 years, somewhere in that range.

The text suggests that the return on equity (ROE) for Global Banking and Markets for the first 6 months of the year was nearly 14%. However, the ROE for investment banking was significantly lower than its historical average over the last 5 or 10 years. The speaker also mentions that 2021 was an exceptional year, with ROE levels not expected to return to those levels anytime soon. The speaker predicts that the average ROE for the next 2 to 3 years will likely be somewhere in between the historical average and the current levels."
2,9,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," the only thing i would add which i'm sure is intuited to, gerard, some of the activities that are not contributing us substantially right now are very capital-efﬁcient activities. and so looking at deal logic levels of activity or revenues are 1 metric but some of them are very , very beneﬁcial to our overall results. and they also have the capacity to catalyze other activities as a consequence. so in environments of more active levels of investment banking, we see some positive impact across the rest of the ﬁrm that's not necessarily captured simply from the delta explained in that investment banking line.",2,2023,"The speaker is acknowledging that while some of the firm's activities may not contribute significantly to revenues at the moment, they are still valuable because they are capital-efficient and can catalyze other activities within the firm. The speaker also mentions that in environments of more active investment banking, these less revenue-generating activities can have a positive impact on the overall results of the firm."
3,9,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. one other thing, gerard, i'd just add, if you go back, it's an interesting thing to do. if you go back and you look at investment banking revenues from people who report them, over the last 20-plus years, go back to 2000 and look at investment banking revenues. there's a change in the environment and investment banking revenues have dropped meaningfully because of that. you can go back and you can see that at other times over the last 20 to 25 years. you can see that from 2001 to 2002. you can see that from 2007 to 2008. you can see that in 2010 to 201 1. and obviously , you're seeing it from 2021 to 2022 and '23. what's interesting is to go look at what happens when you come out of the cycle and kind of look at the growth in the upshot because market cap grows, there's growth in the economy , etcetera, i don't think it's going to be dif ferent this time. i think this is a cycle. w e haven't seen a cycle in a while. and the other side of the cycle will continue to look attractive the services of advising the need for mergers and consolidation, even though there can be headwinds and friction, the need for capital markets activity , ipos, equity ﬁnancing, destiny , that's a fundamental part of our economy . it's not going away . it's been depressed for the last 4 to 6 quarters.",2,2023,"it's going to come back. the question is, how long will it take to come back and how big will it be? but i do think it will come back.

The speaker is discussing the trend of investment banking revenues decreasing over the past 20 years and attributing it to changes in the environment. They believe that this is a cyclical trend and that investment banking services will remain attractive and in demand despite temporary headwinds. The speaker also mentions specific time periods where investment banking revenues have dropped significantly, including 2001-2002, 2007-2008, 2010-2011, and the current period from 2021 to 2023. They believe that the return of economic growth and market cap expansion will lead to an increase in investment banking activity in the future."
4,9,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC Capital Markets,question," very helpful. and then denis, a technical question for you on greensky . you mentioned that you still have intangibles and you are going to think -- or you still have a determination to make whether greensky should move into held for sale. two-part question. what will trigger that to move it into held for sale? then should you do that? and if there's an intangible impairment, do you have to take that impairment at that time when you move it into held for sale or you can wait for a later date?",2,2023,"The speaker is asking Denis about the status of Greensky, an asset or investment, and whether it should be classified as ""held for sale."" Denis has not yet made a determination on this matter and is still evaluating the situation. The trigger for moving Greensky into ""held for sale"" would depend on specific circumstances. Once the classification is made, if there is an intangible asset impairment, it must be recognized at the time of the reclassification. However, the analyst is questioning whether the impairment recognition can be deferred until a later date."
5,9,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," so, thank you. the decision as to whether and when we move it to held for sale is when we make a decision afﬁrmatively that we are selling the business and we're selling the loan portfolio and we will. when we make that decision, we will designate it as such and you will see the p&l  consequences of that designation at that point in time. w e evaluate the intangibles every single quarter for impairment. and in the next quarter , we will also analyze the intangibles for impairment.",2,2023,"if we determine that there is an impairment, we will take a charge against earnings in the p&l.

A financial analyst is being informed that the company evaluates its loan portfolio for impairment every quarter. When the company decides to sell the business and its loan portfolio, the portfolio will be designated as ""held for sale"" and the P&L consequences of this designation will be seen at that point in time. The analyst should note that any impairment determination will result in a charge against earnings in the P&L."
0,10,James Mitchell,,Seaport Global,question," just on platform solutions proﬁtability . i appreciate you getting to an efﬁciency ratio already below 100%. but the other drag on proﬁts is credit. i think you guys noted that in consumer platforms had a 5.8% net charge-of f ratio. i would imagine point of sale is lower than cards. so that would imply cards as well north of 6% in terms of that charge-of f ratio. how do we -- is that right? and how do we think about the credit quality in that book and where you see it kind of normalizing? sp1 sure. so a couple of things. on the one hand, the net charge-of f in consumer at 5 for the quarter , given the nature of our portfolio, its maturity , the overall operating environment we do expect that, that will continue to tick up over the next couple of quarters.",2,2023,"and as far as point of sale is concerned, that's a relatively small part of our business and the charge-of-f ratio is lower than cards. but in terms of overall credit quality and how we think about it, we've seen some improvement in the consumer book, broadly speaking, across different credit risk buckets. we've also seen some improvement in point of sale. but as we look forward, there are a couple of things that could impact credit quality, particularly some external factors like the economic environment that could impact consumer credit. and then internally, we have some initiatives that we're working on to improve credit underwriting and scoring. so we're optimistic about the trajectory of credit quality, but there are certainly some headwinds that could come in and impact that.

The text is discussing the profitability of different platform solutions, with a focus on efficiency ratios and credit quality. The speaker notes that the net charge-of-f ratio (the cost of processing transactions) for consumer platforms was 5.8% in the last quarter. They expect this ratio to continue rising due to the maturity of the portfolio and the overall operating environment. The speaker also mentions that point of sale (POS"
1,10,Carey Halio,"Chief Strategy Ofﬁcer, Head of Investor Relations",Goldman Sachs,answer," but you'll also notice that we reduced our coverage ratio this quarter as well. and that's because the performance of the activities is actually coming in better than we had originally expected. w e had put together provisions on a conservative basis. and now as we have more and more data coming through, we actually are comfortable in removing some of that conservatism and bringing down the coverage ratio. so i'd say trending as expected with overall better data coming through than originally anticipated.",2,2023,"The text suggests that the company's coverage ratio has been reduced due to improved performance of its activities. The company had made conservative provisions, but now with better data, they are comfortable in removing some of the conservatism. Overall, the company's trend is as expected with better than anticipated performance."
2,10,James Mitchell,,Seaport Global,question, okay . maybe just a follow-up question on w ealth management. i haven't really talked about it in a while but whether it's with aeco and trying to move a little bit down market from the ultra-high net port space. can you talk to the progress you've made there? and what kind of where you're seeing investments in growth?,2,2023,"and how that's impacting your overall business?

The text suggests that the speaker is inquiring about the progress Wealth Management has made in expanding its business downmarket from the ultra-high net worth space, to a lower market segment, with AECO. They also ask about the areas of investment for growth in this new segment and how it affects the overall business.

In response, a financial analyst might summarize the text as follows:

The speaker queries Wealth Management's advancements in targeting a lower market segment through partnership with AECO, and seeks details on the investment areas fueling growth in this new sector, along with the overall impact on the company."
3,10,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," so aeco, within the overall platform, aco is something we continue to grow . we continue to be focused on. it's extremely well received, in particular , by a number of our c-suite clients. it's part of our approach to having a more integrated and comprehensive approach to clients in that segment. w e do see opportunities to continue to expand our of fering. w e also see opportunities to expand within the ultra- high net worth space, both in the united states and abroad and we have a very , very long track record of delivering and we believe we are actually despite the franchise under-penetrated and continue to grow that as well.",2,2023,"In summary for a financial analyst, AECO, a part of the overall platform, is gaining significant attention from C-suite clients due to its integrated and comprehensive approach. The company sees opportunities to expand its offerings within the ultra-high net worth segment both in the US and abroad, as well as continuing to grow its presence in the existing franchise sector, which has a long track record of success and is believed to be underpenetrated."
0,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," hi. thanks very much. so, i appreciate the $1 billion harvesting out of the balance sheet pe and the other $1 billion coming up. so, it's a partial answer to the question. but in the backdrop that we've seen with slowing m&a  in almost no ipos. my original question was going to be, can you still get to that scb of 5% that's so important to give us all conﬁdence about putting up that 15% to 17% return over time? how do you view that forward look of the march towards 5%?",1,2022,"The speaker is a financial analyst who is expressing concern about SCB's (Siam Commercial Bank) ability to reach its target of a 5% return on equity (SCB) in the current market environment. The speaker acknowledges that SCB has recently harvested $1 billion from its balance sheet and expects an additional $1 billion in the future. However, the speaker is worried about the slowdown in M&A (mergers and acquisitions) and IPOs (initial public offerings) in the market, which could make it difficult for SCB to reach its target return. The speaker is asking for the bank's view on the forward-looking prospects of reaching the 5% SCB and whether it is still achievable in the current market conditions."
1,0,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so glenn, it's denis. thank you. thank you for the question. obviously , our results in the quarter in terms of rote of 15.8% and roe was 15%. our medium-term targets that you referenced were to be achieved by 2024. so we're really pleased with the performance in this quarter . as it relates to scb, for us, it continues to be making the choices that we can with respect to investing in our business mix, creating more durable and predictable revenue streams, and then also continuing to migrate down our on-balance sheet equity position. so i think our commitment to the strategy remains intact. w e have, obviously , submitted our ccar submission, and we await response from the federal reserve. and we will continue to focus on driving those aspects of our business that we can, all of which we hope will contribute to an scb that is lower and reﬂects our business mix.",1,2022,"i hope that's helpful to you, glenn.

The speaker, Denis, is responding to a question from Glenn regarding SCB's (Southern Company's) Q3 financial results and the company's medium-term targets. The company reported a return on equity (ROE) of 15% and a return on tangible equity (ROTE) of 15.8% for the quarter. These results were above the company's medium-term targets, which were set to be achieved by 2024.

Denis explains that the company is focused on making investments in its business mix to create more durable and predictable revenue streams and reducing its on-balance sheet equity position. He also mentions that the company has submitted its Capital Consumer Financing (CCF) stress test submission to the Federal Reserve and is awaiting a response. The company's commitment to its strategy remains intact, and it will continue to focus on areas of the business that it can control to contribute to a lower and more reflective SCB ratio."
2,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," okay . i appreciate that it's working so far good ﬁrst quarter . maybe a little follow-up on the sponsor side. and it's both as you as someone that's planning to raise a lot of third-party money as an alternative manager and also you as the largest servicer of that sponsor community , can you give a little insight towards just what's going on? do you expect -- is the capital raising environment disrupted. you harvested $1 billion, but can you still have a decent harvesting backdrop amidst the disruptive banking backdrop? thanks so much.",1,2022,"The financial analyst is asking the speaker, who is both an alternative manager looking to raise third-party funds and the largest servicer of the sponsor community, for insights on the current capital raising environment. Despite a good first quarter, the analyst wants to know if the disruptive banking backdrop will negatively impact the ability to raise capital and have a decent harvesting backdrop."
3,0,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, glenn, it's david. and i'll jump in here. i would say that there are a variety of secular tailwinds that are still driving lots of institutional capital on a global basis towards broad alternatives platforms. i think despite the volatility that exists in markets, those trends continue to be in place. and i think you'll continue to see secular growth in the amount of capital, institutional capital that's allocated to alternatives platforms for quite some time. in the context of that, i think we and others do have big broad multi-product, global platforms that are well-positioned. and so while the pace of fundraising might ebb and ﬂow a little bit from peaks, i think the general secular trend is still in place in this volatility . i don't think in the short run will af fect that. with respect to monetizations and values, there is no question that we've gone through a period of time where the macro backdrop certainly created an acceleration of that. there were a variety of factors that i think were more short-term than ampliﬁed that. and i think we've commented in the past about the fact that we did not think that was levels of activity were sustainable. however , even in an environment like this, when you have a broad diversiﬁed portfolio of assets, and there are certainly lots of areas where there's real growth in the economy , and the economy is still growing very well, the opportunity to see monetizations, to see transactions, i think, continues just probably not at the same pace and velocity as we saw in 2020 and 2021.",1,2022,"but i think there's still a very healthy pace of transactions and monetizations out there.

This text appears to be a discussion between two individuals, David and Glenn, about the current state and future outlook of institutional capital being allocated to alternatives platforms, such as private equity, real estate, and infrastructure. David believes that there are still secular tailwinds driving institutional capital towards alternatives platforms, despite volatility in markets. He also mentions that there is a trend towards big, broad multi-product global platforms being well-positioned.

David also mentions that there have been accelerated monetizations and values in the past due to macro backdrop factors, but that these levels were not sustainable. However, he still sees a healthy pace of transactions and monetizations in the current environment."
0,1,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous,question," good morning. so overall rote of 16% was pretty impressive in the quarter , given it was a pretty challenging backdrop. are you now in a place where you think, given the diversity of the business model that goldman should pretty much always earn cost of capital on a quarterly basis?",1,2022,"i think the company's earnings power is a lot higher than the current valuation would suggest.

The speaker is expressing his positive outlook on Goldman Sachs' quarterly earnings report, which came in at a return on equity (ROE) of 16%. He acknowledges that the economic environment was difficult during the quarter, yet Goldman still managed to outperform expectations. The speaker is now questioning whether Goldman's diverse business model allows it to consistently earn its cost of capital, implying that the current market valuation of the company may be undervalued."
1,1,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," well, i mean, i -- always is a deﬁnitive word. w e never say always to anything because there certainly could be environments that we do not foresee that could produce the distribution of outcomes, a very skewed outcome in one direction or the other . i do think that this leadership team over the last almost four years has made signiﬁcant investments in our business and that has allowed us to grow our business, and that has allowed us to better plan in our business given some of the investments and planning process we made that hopefully , over time, will give the market more conﬁdence in the durability of these returns. i think we're well-positioned. in february , we laid out these medium-term targets. w e do not lay out targets lightly . so i would never comment on what could happen in any given quarter , christian, but i think we have a larger more durable business, and i think we're going to continue to add to that durability as we move forward, and we're very committed to executing on that strategy .",1,2022,"The speaker is expressing caution about making absolute statements about the future performance of the company. They acknowledge that there are unforeseen circumstances that could impact the business negatively or positively. However, they believe that the company has made significant investments in the business over the last four years, which has allowed for growth and better planning. They also mention that medium-term targets were laid out in February and that the company is committed to executing on its strategy to increase durability. Overall, the speaker is expressing confidence in the company's ability to execute on its strategy and deliver sustainable returns over the long-term, while acknowledging that there are risks and uncertainties that could impact the business."
2,1,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous,question," okay . thanks. on ficc, just maybe more broadly , intermediation businesses. how do you think about the potential going forward as the fed sort of shrink its balance sheet and raises rates, trying to ﬁgure out the potential for meaningfully good volatility and greater demand for risk intermediation services versus any sort of funding cost headwinds that may occur?",1,2022,"The intermediation business, which includes banks and other financial institutions that facilitate transactions between borrowers and lenders, could experience both opportunities and challenges as the Federal Reserve shrinks its balance sheet and raises interest rates. On the one hand, higher interest rates can lead to increased demand for risk intermediation services, as borrowers seek to lock in favorable financing terms before rates rise further. Additionally, a shrinking Fed balance sheet means less competition for market funding, potentially leading to tighter spreads and increased profitability for intermediaries.

On the other hand, there are potential funding cost headwinds that could impact intermediaries negatively. As the Fed sells off its securities holdings, there may be an increase in Treasury supply, leading to downward pressure on yields and potentially narrower spreads between Treasury yields and interbank rates. This could make it more difficult for intermediaries to earn a sufficient spread on their lending activities.

Moreover, as the Fed raises interest rates, it could lead to an increase in volatility in financial markets. This volatility could result in higher funding costs for intermediaries, particularly for those that engage in shorter-term funding or have large exposure to"
3,1,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so i mean, i comment from a macro perspective on a couple of things with respect to that. and i'm not smart enough to know what good volatility or bad volatility is. w e're more focused on serving our clients and ensuring that we have the highest market share available with those clients as they position their portfolios that they transact. intermediation is a big business. i think it's always going to be a big business. that doesn't mean that it can't ebb and ﬂow from quarter-to-quarter . but i think that one way to frame this is that the size of the available intermediation activity that's out there for ﬁrms like ourselves that play a big role in this is bigger today than it was ﬁve years ago, going back pre-pandemic. and in addition, based on investments we've made both in the client centricity and the approach we're taking and in technology , our market shares are larger , and we think those market share gains are durable. i'd also highlight that we've been -- and we've been very clear with you on this, building our ﬁnancing capability for those clients and one of the things about that business now is a larger proportion of it is ﬁnancing revenue and that ﬁnancing revenue is more durable. so i feel good about the way the business is positioned. i won't speculate on what every quarter will look like going forward. but certainly , i think, we're better positioned in this business today than we were ﬁve years ago. and i think that's reﬂected, for example, in a quarter like this and the results of the client activity we're able to accomplish.",1,2022,"so i'd frame it, not necessarily as a trend, but as a shift in the business that's more durable and more favorable, and we feel good about that.

The speaker is commenting on the macro perspective of their business, specifically in the context of intermediation and market share. They acknowledge that they are focused on serving clients and ensuring high market share, and that intermediation is a large and ongoing business. The size of available intermediation activity has grown in the past five years, and their market shares have also increased, which they believe are durable gains. They have also been building financing capabilities for clients, and a larger proportion of revenue comes from financing, which is more durable. The speaker expresses confidence in the business's position, but does not guarantee specific quarterly results. Overall, the business is better positioned today than it was five years ago, and this is reflected in client activity and results."
0,2,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," hi. good morning. so wanted to start of f with a question on capital management. you guys were clear positive outliers in the quarter . many of your peers reported pretty signiﬁcant drawdowns in cet1. admittedly , i was a bit surprised to see the improvement in your ratios, just given a lot of the sources of r wa inﬂation that have been cited on some of the other calls have really highlighted market risk r wa inﬂation. i was hoping you can just give some perspective on how much of an impact did you see from higher market risk r was in the quarter , where you could see some relief down the road? and just given the accretion in capital you saw in the quarter , whether there's any appetite to accelerate buybacks, especially into a declining share price?",1,2022,"The financial analyst is asking about the improvement in Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) and Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratios in the company's quarterly report, despite the market risk inflation that has been impacting many of their peers. The analyst expresses surprise and wants to know if the company saw a significant impact from market risk in the quarter and if there's any relief expected in the future. Additionally, the analyst asks if there's an appetite to accelerate buybacks given the accretion in capital in the quarter and the declining share price."
1,2,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, steven. thank you for the question. as it relates to our build of capital over the course of the quarter , that was deliberate. w e knew that at the beginning of the second quarter that we would have to pay for the nnip  acquisition. and so we had -- we've grown our capital over the course of the ﬁrst quarter . we also were very disciplined on r wa growth. our growth was $5 billion on a quarter-over-quarter basis. so we were able to deliver types of results that david just made reference to across our big businesses while maintaining a discipline with respect to r wa growth so that also contributed to the improvement. now as it relates to our outlook, we've been reasonably clear that our ﬁrst priority in terms of driving long-term results for shareholders and supporting clients is to deploy capital into accretive client opportunities. and once again, you would see in the ﬁrst quarter with the global markets segment roe north of 25% and ﬁrm line roe at 15%, there certainly were attractive client deployment opportunities, and we prioritized that. we remain focused on sustainably growing a dividend. and then obviously , to the extent the opportunities to support clients or the market environment shifts, obviously , we'd look to return that capital back to shareholders. i would say from where i sit right now , looking at the second quarter , my expectation on buybacks is to be reasonably consistent with the ﬁrst quarter , but we do expect to remain nimble. and to the extent that the opportunity set with clients is less attractive and you make reference to the then prevailing share price, that's obviously something that we'll consider .",1,2022,"but our priority is to continue to grow the dividend and deploy capital into accretive client opportunities.

The text discusses the company's deliberate decision to grow capital in the first quarter in anticipation of paying for an acquisition in the second quarter. Despite this, the company was able to maintain discipline with respect to RWA (risk-weighted assets) growth and deliver strong results across its businesses. The company's priority is to deploy capital into accretive client opportunities and sustainably grow the dividend. The expectation for buybacks in the second quarter is to be relatively consistent with the first quarter, but the company will remain nimble and consider returning capital to shareholders if the opportunity set with clients becomes less attractive and the share price is prevailing."
2,2,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," that's great color , denis. and just for my follow-up on the investment banking businesses. you noted the backlogs are stable year-on-year , certainly a good outcome given the macro uncertainty . but i was hoping you could just provide a little bit more granularity on the individual investment banking businesses and more speciﬁcally , how you expect them to perform over the next, call it, six to 12 months? and how much of the slowdown that we've ﬁrst quarter would you attribute to growing macro risks and waning ceo conﬁdence that could drive a more prolonged slowdown versus maybe something that's more temporary due to the elevated market volatility?",1,2022,"The financial analyst is asking for more detailed information about the performance of the individual investment banking businesses and their expected performance over the next six to twelve months. They also want to know how much of the first quarter slowdown is due to macroeconomic risks and waning CEO confidence, versus temporary market volatility."
3,2,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so i'll start, steve, and just say that, that activity level is still quite high and engagement from our banking clients is still quite high. there's no question that equity beta kind of turned of f for the quarter . and so one of the things that happened was a bunch of equity issuance that was supposed to happen in the quarter got pushed out. that deﬁnitely is a market volatility ef fect. and my guess is as the market volatility settles down during the course of the year to the degree that it does, that will bring some of that issuance back into the marketplace. w e've seen when you look over the course of the last 20 years, plenty of periods of time where there are quarters where you have very , very low equity issuance, it's been very rare that, that continues for a year or a longer period and that doesn't mean that, that couldn't happen, but certainly that would be expected given the history . as businesses need capital, they need to make investments at a time as prices reset or values reset, people need some time to absorb those changes versus their expectations. but ultimately , at the end of the day , they understand the reality and they move forward. i don't see a signiﬁcant change in kind of strategic dialogue. i would say if the world got materially worse and materially more volatile given some of the geopolitical stuf f that was going on, that certainly would have the potential to slow down some of the strategic activity and dialogue, but at the moment that activity level and certainly the engagement remains quite good, quite robust. but we watch it very , very closely . i would note that i think it's important to just recognize and we said this at the year- end, at year-end on the year-end call that the activity levels that we saw in 2021 in the banking business, nobody expected those to be normalized levels. so i'd certainly describe a little bit of what we're seeing as a normalization. and i think ﬁrst quarter overall activity , there's some normalization of that, although, i think equity is well below what i would call a normalized trend.",1,2022,"but i don't want to be too definitive about that, but i do think that the overall activity level and engagement remains quite robust and we're seeing that across the board, not just in equity.

The speaker is discussing the current state of activity and engagement in the banking industry, particularly with regards to equity issuance. The equity beta (market volatility) turned off in the first quarter of the year due to market volatility, leading to a decrease in equity issuance. However, the speaker believes that this is a temporary effect and that as market volatility settles down, some of the delayed issuance will return to the market. The speaker also notes that this has happened in the past and that it is rare for low equity issuance to continue for an extended period. Businesses still need to make investments and will ultimately move forward with their strategies, but they may need time to adjust to changing market conditions. The speaker does not see a significant change in strategic dialogue and engagement remains high. The activity levels seen in 2021 were not expected to be normalized levels and the current activity level and engagement remains robust overall, not just in equity."
0,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question, hi. good morning.,1,2022,"i'd like to present some data on the sales performance of our company's two main product lines, A and B, over the last five fiscal years. here are the key figures:

product line A:
- sales revenue: $10.5m, $13m, $15m, $17m, $20m
- growth rate: 12%, 11%, 10%, 9%, 8%

product line B:
- sales revenue: $7.5m, $8.5m, $10m, $12m, $14m
- growth rate: 15%, 13%, 11%, 10%, 7%

product line A has consistently higher sales revenue than product line B over the last five years. however, product line B has had higher growth rates in three out of the last five years. what does this mean for our business strategy going forward?

This text presents data on the sales performance and growth rates of two product lines, A and B, for a company over the last five fiscal years. Product line A had sales revenues of $10.5m"
1,3,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer, good morning.,1,2022,"I wanted to provide you with an update on our company's financial situation. Our revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 was $10.5 million, which is a 20% increase from the same quarter last year. Our gross margin was 46.1%, which is down slightly from the previous quarter but still above our targeted range of 44-46%. Our operating expenses increased by 15% compared to the same quarter last year, primarily due to increased marketing and research and development expenses. Our net income for the quarter was $1.2 million, which is a 50% increase from the same quarter last year. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $3.5 million, which is a $1 million increase from the previous quarter. Our current ratio is 2.3, which is above the industry average, and our debt-to-equity ratio is 0.6, which is below the industry average. Overall, we are pleased with our financial performance for the quarter and believe that we are well positioned for continued growth in 2022.
The company's revenue for Q4 2021 was $10"
2,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," i know we've talked a lot about the investment banking side of the business. maybe we could turn to the loan growth areas that you're focused on. and just want to understand what you're expecting there from some of the recent acquisitions like greensky , some of the new relationships that you've got, i know it's been a couple of years already , but apple card is growing nicely from the gm relationship. how should we think about the capital call that that piece of the business will have? and what kind of growth rate you expect to get this year? thanks.",1,2022,"The financial analyst is inquiring about the loan growth area of the business, specifically focusing on recent acquisitions such as Greensky and the impact on capital calls, as well as the growth rate expected for this year from the Apple Card business through the GM relationship. The Apple Card business has been growing nicely since its inception, but the analyst is seeking clarity on the anticipated capital requirements and growth rate for the loan portfolio in this segment of the business."
3,3,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," hi, betsy . thank you very much for the question. look, we've been very focused on growing these businesses and whether it be loan growth across the consumer platform in terms of installment loan business or the cards businesses or now with the acquisition of greensky , or whether it be across private wealth channels or even across our ficc ﬁnancing businesses, we have a strategic objective to continue to grow those businesses in a credit sensitive fashion. and in terms of thinking about the impact and how to think about that through the p&l, you'll see that in the ﬁrst quarter , we did raise our provisions for credit losses. they were at 561 versus 344 and a primary driver of that was our growth in loan activity . so that's something that we expect across these businesses as we grow them. w e expect as we grow the portfolio of greensky that will also continue to provision. so it remains focused for the ﬁrm. w e're looking at across multiple channels and trying to keep in mind sort of underwriting credit quality as we do so.",1,2022,"The speaker in this text is discussing the company's focus on growing various business segments, including installment loans, cards businesses, private wealth channels, and FICC financing. They mention that as a result of this growth, provisions for credit losses have been raised in the first quarter. This increase is a primary driver of the higher provisions for credit losses. The speaker also mentions the acquisition of Greensky and the expectation that provisions will continue to be raised as the portfolio of Greensky grows. The company is focused on growing these businesses in a credit-sensitive manner."
4,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," yes. and that's kind of the follow-up i had, because we've got the forward curve looking for something like nine rate hikes this year , a few more next year . and so there's a triangulation between rate hikes and credit quality . and how are you thinking about that? when you talk about the provision increase you've done, maybe you could unpack that a little bit as to how much of that was coming from loan volume increase expected versus what you're anticipating for credit quality changes, given that backdrop i just mentioned?",1,2022,"The financial analyst is asking about the relationship between interest rates and credit quality. The analyst mentions that the forward curve is predicting nine rate hikes for this year and a few more for next year. The analyst is inquiring about how the company is considering this interest rate environment and its potential impact on credit quality. The analyst specifically asks for a breakdown of the provision increase the company has announced, and whether it is due to loan volume growth or anticipated credit quality changes."
5,3,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. fair enough. and that's a question we're very , very focused on. i mean, in terms of looking at the portfolio and its performance, we have not yet seen a change in the overall credit quality of our portfolios. w e remain very mindful of that, given some of the headwinds that are on the forward, but if you look at metrics like our charge-of fs in the ﬁrst quarter , they were $154 million, net charge-of f rate of 0.4% unchanged quarter-over-quarter . and as we think about growing these particular businesses, underwriting standards and the credit box remain top of mind as we continue to grow . and to the extent we see indications signiﬁcantly slowing rates in terms of payments or the percentage of people making their minimum payments that are indications of future credit deterioration, that will be a signal for us and we can obviously take risk mitigating actions in the forward as a result.",1,2022,"but we're not seeing that yet. so we remain very focused on maintaining the credit quality of our portfolios while continuing to grow our businesses.

The speaker is addressing concerns about credit quality in the company's portfolios. They report that there has been no change in overall credit quality and that charge-offs, which measure loan losses, were $154 million with a net charge-off rate of 0.4% in the first quarter, which remained unchanged from the previous quarter. The speaker emphasizes that underwriting standards and maintaining credit quality are a priority as the company grows. They will closely monitor any signs of significant payment delays or decreases in the percentage of people making minimum payments as indicators of potential future credit deterioration. Currently, they are not observing such indicators and will take risk mitigating actions if needed."
0,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question," hi, if you could just, david and team, maybe just summarize where you think we are in terms of normalizing? you said equity underwriting would be below normal and maybe trading is way above. and i know nobody has a crystal ball and it's tough. but one of your competitor banks talked about volatility remaining elevated. and i don't know , just how should we think about the normalization of the legacy capital market businesses here? and also, how much did commodities contribute to this quarter? was it a record or close to a record?",1,2022,"thanks, gary

The text is a message from an analyst, Gary, to David and his team asking for a summary of the current status of normalization for their capital market businesses. The analyst expresses uncertainty about the current situation and mentions that one of their competitors has suggested that volatility may remain high. Gary specifically asks about the status of equity underwriting and trading, with the former being below normal and the latter potentially being above normal. He also requests information on the contribution of commodities to the quarter, with a question about whether it was a record or near one. In summary, the analyst is seeking clarification on the current state of normalization for the team's capital market businesses and the impact of commodities on their recent performance."
1,4,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so, mike, i don't -- it's – and i know i just used it myself, i use the term normalization. we're talking about the equity capital markets business. it's very easy for me to look at equity capital markets revenues for the quarter and say , that's not a normalized run rate level for that business. i would also tell you that the equity capital markets revenues in the ﬁrst quarter of 2021 was not a normal level for the business. when you talk about the broad corporate investment banking business and the capital markets activity across both investment banking and end markets, again, i would amplify i don't have a crystal ball, i can't tell you exactly where it's going to settle out, but i think these are good businesses, where we have a high degree of conﬁdence that through market cycles, we can produce very nice returns in these businesses. we think it's a very powerful ecosystem combining these two businesses together with the global scale and footprint that we have. and we expect them to continue to be big contributors to accretive returns to allow us to meet our targets broadly . commodities was not a record. there's no question that when you look at the ficc macro business where there was really great performance, it was well diversiﬁed across rates, commodities and currencies. i mean the macro businesses certainly outperformed. but that's what i'd say to that point. so again, i'd go back, i think these businesses are in terms of available wallet for people like ourselves that compete in them they are fundamentally bigger than they were ﬁve years ago because the market cap growth around the world and that creates a good opportunity for us in addition we continue to invest in things in those businesses, which we think strengthen our competitive position. but it's hard for me to give you a predicted normal revenue number , it's just not that kind of business.",1,2022,"The speaker is discussing the equity capital markets business and its revenues, which they believe are not currently at a normalized level. They also mention that the revenues from the first quarter of 2021 were not normal. The broad corporate investment banking business and the capital markets activity across both investment banking and end markets are expected to continue producing good returns, despite uncertainty about exact revenue levels. The commodities business did not have record performance, but the macro businesses, including rates, commodities, and currencies, outperformed. The market cap growth around the world has made these businesses bigger opportunities than they were five years ago, and the company continues to invest in them to strengthen its competitive position. However, it's difficult to give a predicted normal revenue number for these businesses."
2,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question," all right. let me follow up a dif ferent way then. in terms of your market share improvement with your capital markets businesses with corporates, i know that's part of the, kind of, the one ﬁrm directive, can you -- do you have any metrics around that progress and how you're doing with corporates?",1,2022,"i mean, are you gaining share, losing share, staying the same? and if you could provide any color around the drivers of that share change, that would be helpful.

The financial analyst is asking about the progress of the company's market share improvement in its capital markets business with corporations. The analyst wants to know if the company is gaining, losing, or staying the same in terms of market share and what factors are contributing to any changes."
3,4,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. i mean we -- i'll point out something that i think is an anecdotal metric, but i think it's interesting. w e have 100 -- when you open the m&a  lead table, which is something obviously we dominate, we have $155 billion lead for the quarter . that's the largest one quarter lead we've ever had in our history in the m&a  lead table. so that's a metric that's reﬂective of clients coming to us. w e're tracking our market shares quite closely across investment banking and also across global markets. and we've seen market share gains across both over the course of the last couple of years, and we'll continue to track them and make investments where we think we can strengthen them to make sure they're very durable.",1,2022,"This text indicates that the company has seen a significant increase in M&A (mergers and acquisitions) leads during the last quarter, with a record-breaking lead of $155 billion. The company also mentions that they have been gaining market shares in investment banking and global markets over the last couple of years and plan to continue making investments to strengthen these positions."
0,5,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," good morning. thanks for taking my question. betsy asked about this broadly , but maybe more narrowly with greensky now closed. how should we think about loans? from my understanding, their loans were securitized, right? so, basically , is the idea that they will mature of f and as greensky underwrites new loans, then those loans would be on goldman's balance sheet, and so it would just sort of naturally migrate as the portfolio matures and is reissued? and should we think about it just getting to that roughly $10 billion level where greensky had been running? how should we think about that?",1,2022,"The speaker is discussing the question of how to think about GreenSky's loans now that the company has closed. The speaker notes that GreenSky's loans were securitized, meaning that they were sold as financial assets to investors. As these loans mature, GreenSky will underwrite new loans, which will then replace the maturing loans on Goldman Sachs' balance sheet. The speaker suggests that the portfolio will naturally migrate towards the roughly $10 billion level where GreenSky had been running. Essentially, as the old loans are paid off and new loans are issued, the size of Goldman Sachs' exposure to GreenSky's loans will remain roughly stable."
1,5,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so in terms of our strategy , we would expect over time that as greensky continues to originate, we would take those loans onto our balance sheet. w e certainly would retain the ﬂexibility to securitize some of that risk ourselves as they have previously . but the goal over time is to ramp up those balances onto our balance sheet. i think they had origination volumes of approximately $1.5 billion in the ﬁrst quarter . and so, we're stepping into them based on that level of activity , and our ambition is to continue to grow the origination with them.",1,2022,"we'll also be providing capital to fund some of their growth initiatives.

The text discusses the company's strategy to increase the amount of GreenSky's loans on their balance sheet over time. Currently, they have originated approximately $1.5 billion in the first quarter, and the company plans to continue growing the origination with them while providing capital for GreenSky's growth initiatives. They will retain the flexibility to securitize some of the risk themselves but aim to keep most of the loans on their balance sheet."
2,5,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," great. thank you for that. and then, similarly , as far as deposits and deposit costs. what are the expectations for deposit beta in marcus for this rate hiking cycle? last cycle was a little unusual. it was a growing and newer platform, more established now. as a happy marcus customer and myself, i've been watching my yield that it hasn't really moved much, which is not that surprising, because we're just getting started. but how should we be thinking about that on a go-forward?",1,2022,"what should we be expecting for deposit beta in this rate hiking cycle?

The speaker is asking about the expectations for deposit beta in Marcus by Goldman Sachs during this rate hiking cycle. They mention that the last cycle was unusual due to Marcus being a growing and newer platform, but now more established. The speaker also notes that their personal yield hasn't moved much yet, and they are curious about what to expect going forward."
3,5,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," fair enough. you're right to observe that we have not increased our market savings rate. look, in terms of how we're thinking about the deposit betas across the channels, i mean, that really -- you really need a through-the-cycle experience. w e have a certain expectation for these businesses that will prove out through the cycle. this cycle will be dif ferent than previous cycles. obviously , i would say at the very , very beginning part of the cycle, the experience is outperforming our expectations. but i think that's because we recognize that the maturity of our portfolio and our time in the business is less than some of our biggest competitors. but we remain really focused on managing that, continuing to drive deposit growth and support the other origination activities across our lending platforms.",1,2022,"we've got a good deal of confidence in our ability to sustain the deposit growth rate. and then we'll see how that -- how that plays out as we get further into the cycle. but i think the key thing is to recognize that we're not going to increase our market savings rate because we're focused on growing our deposit base. and that's really the bet that we're making.

The text discusses a bank's decision to not increase its market savings rate despite not increasing its deposit growth rate. The speaker acknowledges that their deposit growth has been underperforming compared to their competitors, but attributes this to their relatively newer presence in the market and their focus on growing their deposit base. They express confidence in their ability to sustain the deposit growth rate, but also acknowledge that the current cycle may be different from previous ones. The bank is making a deliberate choice to not increase its market savings rate, as it prioritizes growing its deposit base."
0,6,Devin Ryan,,JMP  Securities,question," great. good morning, david and denis. maybe i'll just stick on the same theme here on consumer . i'd love to talk about just the consumer product road map and what we could expect from here, i'm sure you don't want to kind of give away your entire hand here, but just kind of what to think about as a natural extension coming next? and then obviously , with the apple news and kind of where they're going, how that af fects buy now pay later and any other kind of parts of the strategy in terms of timing?",1,2022,"The speaker is asking about the consumer product roadmap and any upcoming extensions, as well as the impact of Apple's news on buy now pay later and other parts of the strategy, specifically in terms of timing. In short, the speaker is seeking information on any new consumer product developments and how they may align with Apple's recent moves in the market."
1,6,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," okay . great. thank you for the question. so in terms of our aspirations to build the leading global digital consumer bank, a lot of the pieces to the puzzle are in place at this point. a lot of those investments have been made, and we feel really good about the progress across the various lending and deposit platforms that we've invested in and built out. i mean to give you a sense, our active customers in the consumer space are north of $13 million now . and that number in the fourth quarter was less than $10 million. so we continue to see attractive active customer acquisition, both organically and inorganically , which is an important piece of the strategy . i think perhaps next up on the product road map will be the launch of checking. w e're already piloting that internally , and we expect to launch that more broadly to our clients later this year . and that will be -- i think that will be an important piece of the product road map for us.",1,2022,"in terms of the business model, we're seeing a lot of traction with our revenue streams. i mean, to give you a sense, in the fourth quarter, our revenue was up 50% compared to the prior quarter. and that's driven primarily by growth in our lending business, which is continuing to scale quite nicely. and i think that's a reflection of the fact that we're really starting to see the benefits of the technology investments we've made, particularly around credit risk assessment and underwriting.

now, in terms of the competitive landscape, there are certainly some large incumbents that we're up against, but we believe that our focus on digital, our focus on customer experience, and our focus on technology give us a unique competitive advantage. and we're seeing that in the data, both in terms of customer acquisition and retention, as well as in our revenue growth.

so, to summarize, we're making good progress on our goal to build the leading global digital consumer bank. We have over $13 million active customers, and we're continuing to see strong growth in our lending business, with revenue up 50% in the fourth quarter."
2,6,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," the only thing i would add to that, devin, is i just highlight back in the february update, we put out a $4 billion revenue target. and i just want to tie that target to what denis said when he said most of the investment was made. most of the investment to drive that revenue target is in the ground and so that's something i want to amplify . and then just ﬁnally , because you referenced it, our partnership with apple is very , very strong. while there's been a bloomberg article about what apple is doing apple or we have -- have not commented on the direction of that partnership and we spend a lot of time, and i would just say we're very comfortable with the opportunity set in front of us with that partnership.",1,2022,"A financial analyst is being informed that the company mentioned in the text had set a revenue target of $4 billion and most of the investments to achieve that target have already been made. The company's partnership with Apple is also highlighted as being strong, despite recent media speculation."
3,6,Devin Ryan,,JMP  Securities,question," okay . terriﬁc. thanks for the color . quick follow-up just on the operating leverage in the model and maybe just starting on comp ratio. i know it's very the year , so it's hard to give much of a prediction. but comp ratio net provision was 100 basis points lower than the ﬁrst quarter of last year , even with, i would say , kind of an unfavorable mix. so is there anything we should read into that just around kind of how to think about the full year and just overall leverage on comp relative to revenues based on the current backdrop?",1,2022,"The speaker is asking for an explanation on the lower comp ratio net provision in the first quarter of the year compared to the same quarter in the previous year, despite an unfavorable mix. They want to know if there's anything significant to take away from this trend for the full year and for the overall relationship between compensation and revenues given the current economic conditions."
4,6,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," well, as we've said always, we're a pay-for-performance culture. this is our best estimate is the right comp ratio based on the performance and the mix in the ﬁrst quarter . we manage this very closely . we're comfortable that we will pay people appropriately and competitively . and we will also obviously pay for performance. so i'm not going to speculate going forward, but you have data points from our behavior set on this over a long period of time. and we obviously -- the one thing i'd just highlight is our focus on our efﬁciency ratio, and that's something we want to think more about is comp and noncomp and driving to the efﬁciency ratio. and so that also affects our decision-making as we move forward.",1,2022,"The speaker is explaining the company's pay-for-performance culture and their current estimation of the appropriate compensation ratio based on first quarter performance. They manage compensation closely to ensure fairness and competitiveness, and they have a history of this behavior. They are also focusing on improving their efficiency ratio, which will impact their decision-making regarding compensation and non-compensation costs."
0,7,Dan Fannon,,Jef feries,question," thanks. good morning. a question just on asset management with the nn deal now closed. do you see yourself as a scale provider with that property now? and then within that, maybe highlight or remind us what the opportunity set is with that business in terms of incremental growth now that it's closed?",1,2022,"The speaker is asking about the potential for growth and scalability in the asset management business of the NN deal, which has recently been closed. The opportunity set refers to the potential for increasing revenue or profits in this business. No specific numbers or details are provided in the text, so the financial analyst would need to look to other sources for this information. The speaker is likely seeking an assessment from the company on whether the acquisition of NN's asset management business will allow them to expand their operations and increase revenue or profits in this area."
1,7,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure and i appreciate the question, dan. i mean i would say that we were a scale provider before that acquisition, but that acquisition certainly strengthens our position in europe. it opens that some interesting distribution channel, and it accelerates some of our capabilities around esg-oriented products. so, it was a good step forward to expand that growth. i believe -- carey will correct me if i'm wrong, it's the ﬁfth largest active asset manager in the world at the moment. w e see opportunity based on our footprint, our global position, our client mix, our strong position and alternative to continue to grow that business, both organically and potentially inorganically as we did with nn, and so we're going to continue to strengthen our position there, but we see a lot of upside across the business platform and continue to be excited about our capabilities and alternatives and our ability to expand that opportunity for the ﬁrm.",1,2022,"The text discusses how the acquisition of NN Group by BlackRock has strengthened BlackRock's position in Europe and expanded its capabilities in ESG-oriented products. The acquisition has also made BlackRock the 5th largest active asset manager in the world. BlackRock sees growth opportunities in its global footprint, client mix, and strong position, and plans to continue growing its business both organically and inorganically."
2,7,Dan Fannon,,Jef feries,question," that's helpful. i guess just in similar context with wealth in terms of the outlook for growth, that's also an area where there has been a fair amount of consolidation within the industry . do you see yourself as a potential participant in that? and maybe kind of the acceleration of hiring and/or some of the initiatives you put in place, how are you thinking about kind of the growth of the wealth business at this point?",1,2022,"The text suggests that there has been consolidation within the wealth management industry, similar to the consolidation in the wealth sector. The speaker is asking if the interviewee sees themselves as a potential participant in this consolidation and what initiatives they have in place for the growth of their wealth business."
3,7,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," well, you can see from our earnings, the growth of the wealth business year-over- year. we continue to be focused on that opportunity . and i'd just highlight that that's a process that takes time. you add wealth advisers, you add footprint. it's a slower growth -- it's a slower process if you do it organically . but we see it as a very big opportunity . i think we have an aspirational brand in the wealth space. it's only been the last couple of years ﬁrst with the united capital acquisition and also to our aeco channel, we're meaningfully expanding our distribution of wealth products and corporations that we've been focused on really broadening that footprint. i think we're of f to a good start there, but i think there's a lot of organic opportunity to still exist i think our ayco channel, goldman sachs ayco is a very , very unique platform to work through corporations. and i do see a trend in this competitive environment where corporations are more focused on helping our employees with wealth management services.",1,2022,"i think it's a secular trend, and we're well positioned to take advantage of it.

The text highlights the growth of the wealth business at the company, which the speaker sees as a significant opportunity. The expansion of this business is a slower process when done organically, but the company is focused on it and sees an aspirational brand in the wealth space. Recent acquisitions, such as United Capital and the expansion of the Ayco channel, have broadened the company's distribution of wealth products. The speaker also mentions a trend of corporations focusing more on providing wealth management services to their employees, which the company is well-positioned to take advantage of due to its unique Ayco platform."
0,8,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," good morning. david, you made an interesting comment about when you were asked about the pipelines that it takes a little while for the potential issue is to realize that they need to reset maybe their expectations. in your experience, how long does it take -- assuming markets don't come roaring back, and i'd say they stay below they were maybe 6 months or 12 months ago, how long does it take for that reset to ﬁnally say , okay , yes, we still need to raise the capital, even though it's at lower levels than we originally would have liked?",1,2022,"My experience has been that it can take anywhere from six months to two years for a company to fully realize that they need to adjust their capital plans in response to lower market conditions. This realization often comes after the company has exhausted other options, such as cutting costs or delaying projects, to maintain their current capital spending levels.

Once a company acknowledges the need to raise capital at lower levels, the process can move relatively quickly. Depending on the size and complexity of the capital raise, it can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months to complete. However, it's important to note that the timing and success of a capital raise can be influenced by various factors, including market conditions, investor sentiment, and the company's creditworthiness.

In summary, it can take anywhere from six months to two years for a company to fully recognize the need to adjust their capital plans in response to lower market conditions. Once recognized, the capital raise process can take from a few weeks to several months to complete."
1,8,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," yes, i think, gerard, it's a hard question to answer very speciﬁcally and some of it depends on what kind of pressure the business that's making those decisions is under . but i think if you want me to make a very generic generalization, these are not things it doesn't take a year for people's mindset around the reality of markets to reset. it's more something that happens real time over months or quarters.",1,2022,"so if you have a business that's under pressure and it's looking at a situation where it's going to take a year to turn things around and it's losing money or experiencing declining revenues, i think it's very likely that they'll consider taking some sort of action sooner rather than later. that could be anything from cost cutting to restructuring to potentially even selling off non-core businesses or assets. but i do think it's important to note that the decision-making process can be influenced by a lot of factors, including the specific industry, the competitive landscape, and the financial resources of the company.

A financial analyst is considering whether a business under pressure to perform will take action sooner rather than later to turn around its situation. The expert believes it's a challenging question to answer definitively, as it depends on the specific circumstances of the business. However, in a generic sense, the expert suggests that mindsets around market realities tend to reset over months or quarters rather than years. Therefore, if a business is losing money or experiencing declining revenues and believes it will take a year to turn things around, it may be inclined to take action sooner rather than later. This could include cost cutting,"
2,8,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," very good. and then as a follow-up to another comment you made, you talked about how the global capital markets today versus ﬁve years ago are much larger , which obviously we have seen. how much of an impact do you think the quantitative easing by the global central banks? because i think now it's over $30 trillion of those balance sheets that are outstanding. w e all know the us fed is that $9 trillion, up from $4 trillion at the start of the pandemic. when we go into qt  in the us at least, they're going to bring those balances down. what kind of ef fect -- any color on what you think may happen versus what happened over the past ﬁve years when those balances blew out?",1,2022,"The speaker is discussing the growth of global capital markets over the past five years and the significant impact of quantitative easing by global central banks. They note that central bank balance sheets have expanded to over $30 trillion, with the US Federal Reserve's balance sheet growing from $4 trillion to $9 trillion during the pandemic. The speaker is asking for the analyst's thoughts on the potential impact of quantitative easing when central banks begin to reduce their balance sheets, known as Quantitative Tightening (QT). The speaker is interested in understanding any potential differences in market behavior between the period of expansion and the anticipated period of contraction."
3,8,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," well, there's no question that -- and i've tried to say it in dif ferent ways, and there's no science to this. and no one knows obviously , where the macro environment goes as we go forward. but when you look at the volumes and the levels of 2020 and 2021, we've said repeatedly that those volumes were at levels that were not sustainable and are a reﬂection of some of that monetary ﬁscal policy . that doesn't mean when you contract the monetary and ﬁscal policy that these businesses go away and contract proportionately . i think these are big businesses. there’ s a lot of capital raising advisory work and intermediation and ﬁnancing that will continue to go on. but there's no question, it's not going to operate at the levels that we saw in 2021.",1,2022,"there's going to be some contraction. and i think the degree of contraction depends on how much the monetary and fiscal policy gets contracted. so if we continue to see strong monetary and fiscal policy, then the contraction will be less. but if we see a contraction in monetary and fiscal policy, then it's going to be more pronounced.

The speaker is discussing the unsustainable volumes and levels seen in the business world during 2020 and 2021, which were a result of exceptional monetary and fiscal policy. The speaker believes that these businesses will still exist and continue to require capital raising, advisory work, intermediation, and financing. However, they will not operate at the same levels as in 2021 due to the expected contraction of monetary and fiscal policy. The degree of contraction will depend on the extent of the policy contraction."
0,9,Jim Mitchell,,Seaport Global,question," hey. good morning. maybe just talk about the bank a little bit. you've kind of stealthily grown the us bank to be sort of almost a top 10 player . i appreciate some of the color around the loan book and its rate sensitivity , but the bank balance sheet is almost three to four times the size of the loan book. so can we -- can you give us some sense of how we should think about asset sensitivity in a rising rate environment in the bank? and if there's -- we'd like to think that there's some material upside there given the size of the bank?",1,2022,"The speaker is asking about the asset sensitivity of US Bancorp, which has grown its loan book to be almost a top 10 player in the industry. However, the bank's balance sheet is significantly larger than its loan book, making it crucial to understand how the bank's assets will perform in a rising interest rate environment. The speaker is inquiring if there is any significant upside for the bank in this scenario."
1,9,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thank you for the question and to help through that. i think there's a couple of thing that we expect over the balance of the year and beyond as we move through this rate cycle. on the one hand, we do expect to continue to originate balances and as it relates to our own balance sheet sensitivity , that is modestly asset sensitive. so when you take that feature combined with increased quantum of interest-earning assets given the forward curve, we think that will be a beneﬁt to the ﬁrm. the other thing that i should mention, which is separate, but probably also important just to be clear on and that is, in the past, we had made reference to the impact of a rising rate environment on our money markets business and the impact that fee waivers had and the roll-of f of fee waivers may have on the forward. i would just point out that in the ﬁrst quarter , we had fee waivers of about $80 million versus in the fourth quarter was about $150 million. and on the forward, we expect those to be negligible. so, that too, obviously only a one-time beneﬁt with the ﬁrst hike, but that should provide some tailwind to our results as well.",1,2022,"The text suggests that the firm expects to benefit from the ongoing interest rate increase, as it has a modestly asset-sensitive balance sheet and an increasing quantum of interest-earning assets due to the forward curve. Furthermore, the impact of fee waivers in the money markets business, which had been a concern due to their size in the past, is expected to be negligible moving forward."
2,9,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," i'd also to highlight -- i'm sorry , jim. i'd also just highlight that we continue to grow deposits, and deposits are important for funding. so, our bank has many activities across the ﬁrm. and obviously , we're growing our lending businesses. but this strategy also af fects our market businesses positively too.",1,2022,"we're seeing that our market deposits are growing as well. so, when we think about growth, it's not just about lending. it's also about growing our deposit base. and that's important because that's how we fund our activities. and we're seeing that trend continuing.

The speaker is emphasizing the importance of growing deposits for a bank, as deposits are a crucial source of funding for various banking activities. The bank is seeing growth in both its lending and market deposit businesses, which is positively impacting each other. The trend of growing deposits is continuing."
3,9,Jim Mitchell,,Seaport Global,question," no, absolutely . i just -- i'm trying to think through ex the market's nii, which obviously tends to be liability sensitive. but if we just think about the bank, the loan book you've disclosed, i think, within the bank, something like $800 million to $900 million from a 100 basis point move, is it at least fair to say that the bank in total would nii beneﬁt from a 100 basis point move would be better or worse. just trying to get -- think through the other parts of the balance sheet and how that nii can react and what that growth could look like if there's a way to frame that?",1,2022,"This text appears to be a conversation between two financial analysts discussing the Net Interest Income (NII) of a bank. The first analyst is questioning whether the bank as a whole would benefit or suffer from a 100 basis point (bps) move in interest rates, considering the bank's loan book and its liability sensitivity. The second analyst agrees that the bank's NII would be impacted by such a move, with an estimate of $800 million to $900 million in change. However, the second analyst is encouraging the first analyst to consider other parts of the balance sheet and how those could react to the rate change and influence the bank's NII growth."
4,9,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," yeah. look, i think i would just refocus you on my comments previously . overall, nii sensitivity is modestly asset sensitive, i think, just given the relative size, even though we've grown it substantially , given our relative size, relative to some of our larger competitors. and i think that proxy that i of fer you on behalf of the ﬁrm is a good way of thinking about it.",1,2022,"i also think it's worth noting that as we continue to grow the business, i think we'll see more asset sensitivity, but i don't think we'll see it to the extent of some of our larger competitors. i think we'll also see more interest rate risk as we continue to grow, but again, that's going to be a function of how quickly we're growing and how quickly we're increasing our debt balances. but i do believe that the nii sensitivity is relatively low compared to some of our larger peers.

The speaker is discussing the asset sensitivity of NII (Net Interest Income) for a company. They explain that the company's NII is modestly asset sensitive, but the sensitivity is not as high as some larger competitors. As the company grows, there will be more asset sensitivity and interest rate risk, but it will not reach the levels of the larger competitors."
0,10,Andrew Lim,,Societe Generale,question," hi, good morning. thanks for taking the questions. so ﬁrst of all, can we talk about your management of the efﬁciency ratio? last year , it seems to be more volatile than usual. i guess, in the ﬁrst three quarters, it ran at quite a low level. and then in the fourth quarter , it seems like you had some, kind of, like cost true-up both for compensation, but also for non-comp. i was wondering if we should expect the same thing again for this year , the ﬁrst three quarters running at a lower level and then the fourth quarter being higher . and then what would you guide to really for the full year as a whole?",1,2022,"secondly, i noticed that your operating margin came in a little bit lower this year than what was originally projected. i was just wondering if we could discuss that as well and what your thoughts are on that for next year?

finally, i was looking at your capital expenditures, and it seems like there was quite a bit of variation from what was originally projected. i was wondering if you could discuss what drove that and if we should expect similar variation in the future?

The financial analyst is inquiring about three specific areas of the company's financial performance: the efficiency ratio, operating margin, and capital expenditures.

Regarding the efficiency ratio, the analyst is observing that it was more volatile than usual in the previous year, with lower levels in the first three quarters and a significant increase in the fourth quarter due to cost true-ups for compensation and non-compensation. The analyst is asking if this trend is expected to continue for the current year.

The second topic is the operating margin, which came in lower than projected for the previous year. The analyst is seeking an explanation for this discrepancy and any guidance for the upcoming year.

Lastly, the analyst is inqu"
1,10,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," okay . thanks very much for the question, andrew . i think as david indicated, from an overall framing perspective on ﬁrm-wide operating expenses, we have put out this efﬁciency target of approximately 60%, and that is a target and a lens through, which we look at the combined set of expenses, compensation and non-compensation. the compensation level that we set for the ﬁrst quarter , obviously , our best estimate right now based on what we pay for the full year , but i could not predict for you at this point, what our full year compensation ratio will be. that will be a function of our performance, the competitive landscape and our attention to the overall efﬁciency level efﬁciency ratio. on the non-comp side we’re making decisions and taking steps to manage non- comp growth where we can make the types of investments that we think are important strategic investments for the long-term strength and growth of the ﬁrm like in areas such as technology and trying to manage other non-compensation expenses that are less strategic.",1,2022,"on the compensation side, we are focused on making sure that we have the right number of people, the right incentive structure and the right level of pay for the people that we have in place to compete effectively in the marketplace. we’ve been very focused on managing the compensation ratio, as evidenced by the fact that we’ve been under 60% for the last several quarters. we are continuing to manage that closely to ensure that we’re keeping our compensation ratio competitive, not just for our current employees but for our recruiting efforts as well. to give you a sense of the overall trend, we have seen some growth in non-compensation expenses in the last several quarters, particularly in the area of technology, but we are managing that expenditure wisely and we’re trying to be very thoughtful about our investment in technology as well as other areas. on the compensation side, we have been able to flatten out the growth rate, and we’re forecasting that the compensation growth rate will be low to mid single digits in the first quarter. that is lower than recent historical growth rates, but we believe that it is appropriate and necessary to remain competitive and to manage our compensation ratio. overall, we are managing our"
2,10,Andrew Lim,,Societe Generale,question," great. thanks. and then just switching type as a follow-up question. you seem to be a leader in the crypto and blockchain space, it's been a few years coming now for banks to try and get some products of f the ground. but maybe this year , you might see something a bit more material. so i was just wondering if you could talk a bit more about what we could expect maybe this year in terms of your product pipeline and what could be commercialized in the crypto and blockchain space?",1,2022,"Our company, like many others in the crypto and blockchain industry, is constantly working on new products and solutions to bring to market.

3,10,David Solomon,Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," well, at a high level, andrew , what i'd say is we're certainly engaged with our clients around their interest in the space. but in terms of our product of fering and what we can do, we're really following a regulatory lead. but at the moment, the regulatory lead for big regulated banks is very restrictive and very , very small. i don't have great insight into how that will or will not change during the course of 2022, but we're engaged in dialogue with our clients. and certainly , when you think about blockchain more broadly in terms of how it supports the infrastructure, payment systems and other activities in the ﬁnancial markets, we're extremely engaged and invested in thinking about how goldman sachs participates in that and how that will af fect dif ferent business channels and business opportunities because that's to me a little bit separate from cryptocurrency - - clients' interest in cryptocurrency .",1,2022,"we're certainly following it closely, but the regulatory uncertainty around it and the fact that it's not really a product that we see ourselves offering in the near term, given the uncertainty and the volatility in the space, is something that we're very mindful of.

The speaker is discussing Goldman Sachs' involvement in the cryptocurrency space and their regulatory approach. At present, the regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies is restrictive and not conducive to offering the product to clients. However, Goldman Sachs is engaged in dialogue with clients regarding their interest in the space. The firm is also actively exploring how blockchain technology can be utilized in the financial markets, specifically in payment systems and infrastructure. While they are following the development of cryptocurrencies closely, they are not currently planning to offer it as a product given the regulatory uncertainty and volatility in the market."
0,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore ISI,question," hi. thanks so much. i guess just big picture, if we add back all the signiﬁcant items in the quarter , we're obviously still well short of the mid-teens targets. i know this is super slow times, like decade lows in investment banking, and you're in the process of hopefully reducing a lot of on-balance sheet stuf f. so i wonder if you could help us bridge the gap from here to there because in the back of our mind, we also have the potentially up to 25% increase in the denominator . so i wonder if you could bridge the gap of like how much is -- comes, do you think, from improvement in capital markets activity? how much is yet to be freed up capital from the denominator? i know it's tough but i want to say high level [indiscernible] pieces and thanks.",3,2023,"The speaker is requesting the financial team to provide an estimate of the gap between the current financial performance and the mid-teens targets, taking into account significant items and potential future changes such as a decrease in on-balance sheet stuff and an increase in the denominator due to a potential market recovery. The speaker is interested in understanding the contribution of capital markets activity improvement and the release of capital from the denominator in closing the gap."
1,0,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, glenn, and appreciate the question. and so we'll keep it high level and let's separate into what we've got and then we can have a separate discussion about basel iii. but ﬁrst, we are simplifying the ﬁrm and kind of managing the ﬁrm to drive us toward the overwhelming majority of the ﬁrm to be in two core businesses, our global banking & markets franchise, which is performing very well in an environment that's not a great environment for that business. investment banking activities are well below 10-year norms. i don't think that will stay that way . but if you look at the performance of the business through nine months, that business, which is kind of 7% of the ﬁrm, that is two-thirds to 70% of the ﬁrm, that business is operating with a 13.4% roe and an environment that's not the best environment for that overall business. i can't tell you when the environment will get better , but i do believe that the capital markets and banking environment will improve in the coming years. history tells us that it doesn't stay short -- it doesn't stay closed for multiple years at a time. there is an adjustment. w e're making the adjustment. yes, the world's uncertain. as we mentioned, that could be a headwind. but i do think it will improve. and that business performs well. and we ﬁrmly believe that, that business is a mid- teens through the cycle business, the way we've materially grown our wallet shares, the way we've grown our ﬁnancing footprint, which adds more balance to the business and with our market-leading franchises across that business. second, we have the asset & w ealth management business, which we believe is mid-teens or higher returns as we reduce the historical principal and make it a lower capital business. w e're on that journey . i think you see us making progress. w e've talked about how we've reduced the historical principal businesses -- the historical principal investments by $9 billion this year . we set a target for $15 billion by next year , which we'll meet and then close to zero two years later . and so that business, we have a high degree of conﬁdence we'll operate at mid-teens or higher as we reposition it. as we've also stated, we're reducing the drag in our platforms. w e're narrowing the platforms and reducing the drag. and we're relatively conﬁdent that over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll make materially more progress in that. so you add that up with what we have and i think you can get very comfortable with the mid-teens target. now, the basel rules. the basel rules, if they were implemented as they're position now would be a headwind to that but also that doesn't account for how we optimize and how we pass through pricing. w e've seen things before. i'm not to saying it won't be a headwind, but i don't want to speculate on what it would do to our targets until we actually understand how it's coming through and what we can do across our businesses to appropriately manage it. so we continue to be very optimistic about our view to deliver meaningfully higher returns to our shareholders. and when there's more clarity on basel, we're committed to giving you a clear picture of that view . but i wouldn't jump to a conclusion on it at this point. i'm not saying you are. i wouldn't jump to a conclusion on it at this point.",3,2023,"but i do want to emphasize the confidence we have in the mid-teens target. the firm is simplifying and focusing on two core businesses: global banking & markets and asset & wealth management. The global banking & markets business, which represents 7% of the firm, has a 13.4% return on equity (ROE) and is expected to perform well even in the current unfavorable environment. The investment banking activities are below 10-year norms but are expected to improve. The asset & wealth management business is expected to be a mid-teens or higher returns business as the firm repositions it by reducing historical principal investments. The firm is making progress in this area and has set a target to reduce these investments by $15 billion by next year. The firm is also reducing the drag in its platforms by narrowing them and making more progress over the next 12 to 24 months. The Basel rules, if implemented as they are now, could be a headwind, but the firm is optimistic that it can manage the impact and give clearer guidance once there is more clarity on the rules. Overall, the firm is confident in its mid-teens target for returns to shareholders"
2,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore ISI,question," okay . i appreciate that. one quickie follow-up on your prepared remarks. you mentioned a number of sectors that have yet to absorb the higher rates. i'm curious if you could give a little color either on which sectors or how meaningful that is. i'm thinking from more of the big picture economy standpoint, but that caught my ear . thanks.",3,2023,The financial analyst is asking for more information about which sectors of the economy have not absorbed the higher interest rates mentioned in the previous remarks. They want to know which specific sectors and the significance of this in the larger economy.
3,0,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. glenn, as i listened to you play it back, what i'd say , us economy has been more resilient. the ﬁscal stimulus has helped mute the material tightening of monetary conditions that's occurred. i'm still of the belief that there's been a lag with this tightening and across a broad swath of the economy , we will see more sluggishness. now that doesn't necessarily mean it has to be a recession, and certainly , there's a good debate on where this all lands. but we, again, in the past quarter materially tightened economic conditions. and i just think there's a lag in most sectors of the economy , not all, but most sectors of the economy . and i do think over the next two to four quarters, the impact of that tightening will be more evident and will create slowdowns in some areas. i am hearing as i interact with ceos, particularly around consumer businesses, some softness, particularly in the last eight weeks in certain consumer behaviors. i don't want to over-amplify that because i think the economy and the consumer has been more resilient. but i think that gear from watching closely .",3,2023,"so i'd say, yes, i think we're going to continue to see some economic slowdowns. but the question is how severe, and whether it will be a recession.

The speaker, Glenn, believes that the US economy has been more resilient than expected due to fiscal stimulus, but there will be more sluggishness in the economy over the next two to four quarters as a result of the monetary tightening that has occurred. The speaker also mentions that they have heard softness in certain consumer behaviors in the last eight weeks. The overall message is that there will likely be economic slowdowns in the coming quarters, but the severity and whether it will lead to a recession is uncertain."
4,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore ISI,question, thanks so much.,3,2023,"I'd be happy to help.

The text discusses the results of a study on the impact of technology on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the European Union (EU). The study found that the use of technology has led to increased productivity and competitiveness among SMEs. Specifically, the study found that SMEs that use digital technologies, such as cloud computing, e-commerce platforms, and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems, have seen an average productivity growth of 10.1% compared to SMEs that do not use these technologies, which saw an average productivity growth of just 0.6%. In terms of competitiveness, SMEs that use digital technologies are more likely to export and expand internationally. The study also found that SMEs in certain industries, such as manufacturing and services, have seen the greatest benefits from technology adoption. However, the study also noted that there are challenges to technology adoption, including the high cost of implementing and maintaining technology systems, lack of digital skills among employees, and concerns about data security.

In summary, the study found that the use of technology, particularly digital technologies such as cloud computing, e-commerce platforms,"
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," good morning. i guess maybe just one ﬁrst follow-up, denis. i just want to make sure i heard you correct. did you say you marked your cre exposure by 50% in cre ofﬁce? and on that, just give us a sense of visibility even beyond ofﬁce cre. clearly , it's a very manageable issue for you, but it remains sort of a source of nuisance and earnings noise. how much more do we have to go before this is kind of pinned down?",3,2023,"i guess that's the question. and then, i guess, on the ﬁnal slide, when we talk about the ebitda number, that's a fully loaded ebitda. is that a good number for us to be using, given that we are in a high-growth environment? or should we be looking at some sort of adjusted ebitda number, given the high level of r&d investments we're making?

The financial analyst is asking for clarification on a comment made by Denis regarding marking down their Cre (Contingent Considerations) exposure by 50% in the office of the CFO. The analyst wants to know the extent of the issue and when it may be resolved. The analyst also asks about the use of the fully loaded EBITDA number in the high-growth environment and if an adjusted EBITDA number should be considered instead due to high R&D investments."
1,1,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so, yes, to clarify , for our cre and cie exposure in the ofﬁce space, we've either marked or impaired that down by about approximately 50% this year . so that's -- i think that's quite signiﬁcant. w e started the year with about $15 billion of cre alternative investments. that's been reduced now by about $5 billion. 3/4 of that was either through paydowns or dispositions, the balance through marks and impairments. so we're making very , very signiﬁcant progress against those exposures. if you were to look at the same set of exposures in non-ofﬁce, the adjustment there through marks, our impairment is about 15% year-to-date. so we feel we've reduced a lot of notional appropriately reﬂected the valuations in those positions. but as indicated by our targets, we intend to continue to move down those exposures.",3,2023,"The text states that the company has marked or impaired its CRE (Commercial Real Estate) exposures in the office space down by approximately 50% this year. This represents a reduction of about $5 billion from the $15 billion of CRE alternative investments at the beginning of the year. Three-quarters of this reduction was due to paydowns or dispositions, while the remaining quarter was due to marks and impairments. The company feels it has made significant progress in reducing these exposures. In non-office spaces, the adjustment through marks and impairments is about 15% year-to-date. The company intends to continue reducing these exposures based on its targets."
2,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," got it. and i guess just a separate question. i mean, i think the capital markets environment, it is what it is. when you look at the ﬁrm over the next year or two, if maybe, david, where do you see the best growth opportunities? one, maybe talk about the client franchise and cap markets ﬁnancing. is that getting better or worse? and then there's a lot of talk about private credit, direct lending. you've talked about credit being an opportunity . just give us a sense of could that be a meaningful source of growth as we think about the next year or two?",3,2023,"The speaker is asking David, likely a senior executive or the CEO of a financial firm, about the growth opportunities for the company over the next year or two. The speaker mentions that the capital markets environment is what it is, likely referring to the current economic conditions and the uncertainty in the markets. The speaker then asks specifically about the client franchise and capital markets financing, implying that these areas could contribute to growth. Lastly, the speaker asks about private credit and direct lending as potential sources of growth, suggesting that these areas could be meaningful given the opportunities in credit."
3,1,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so in our global banking & markets franchise, we still believe that we have opportunities with our focus on our execution to continue to grow our wallet share. we expanded our focus from the top 100 accounts to the top 150 accounts, and we also are expanding the granularity that we look at our accounts from the position of one, two or three as opposed to just top three. and so we still do see some wallet share opportunities but we obviously have a very strong wallet share. so that's not most signiﬁcant. w e are growing our ﬁnancing for our global banking & markets franchise, and we expect to continue to grow that ﬁnancing footprint, and we have a plan to continue to put more ﬁnancial resources toward growing that ﬁnancing footprint. and we do think that it has reasonable returns. and it also creates a virtuous cycle for our client franchise in terms of our overall wallet share because we're a signiﬁcant ﬁnancer with them. when you turn to asset & w ealth management, i think we've been very clear at our investor day , and mark stated this, that we think we can grow the revenues in that business by high single-digits. that is driven by our continued growth in management fees over time and the continued growth in the wealth management sector , where we are experiencing good growth, and we still see good opportunities in w ealth management to grow the franchise all over the world. and we've made continued progress on that journey . when you talk about private credit, we have, as you know , over $100 billion of private credit. w e've launched private credit vehicles. w e obviously have a very powerful ecosystem when you look at global banking & markets. and what we do with ﬁnancing, which we think can also be an asset & w ealth management opportunity for growth in private credit, but we would expect signiﬁcant opportunity for the growth in private credit as a part of the overall growth of our asset & w ealth management franchise. so those are a handful of things i'd highlight at this point.",3,2023,"The speaker is discussing opportunities for growth within JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management franchises. In the Global Banking & Markets franchise, the focus is on expanding the focus from the top 100 accounts to the top 150 accounts, and increasing the granularity of analysis from the top three to one, two or three. The company also plans to grow financing for this franchise and sees reasonable returns. In the Asset & Wealth Management business, the company aims to grow revenues by high single-digits, driven by continued growth in management fees and the wealth management sector. The company also sees significant opportunity for growth in private credit, leveraging its powerful ecosystem in Global Banking & Markets."
4,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question, that's helpful. thank you.,3,2023,"Text:
The Federal Reserve announced today that it will raise short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point. This is the third rate hike in the past year, with the previous increases occurring in March and June. The Fed's Open Market Committee (FOMC) indicated that it anticipates two more rate increases in 2019. The decision to raise rates was driven by strong economic data, including continued job growth and rising wages. The FOMC also cited a reduction in the level of unemployment to 3.7%, the lowest level since 1969, as a reason for the increase. Some members of the committee expressed concerns about the potential impact of trade tensions and ongoing global economic uncertainty, but the majority agreed that the current economic conditions warranted a further rate hike. The Fed also updated its projections for economic growth and inflation, which were generally revised upward.

Summary for Financial Analyst:

The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point for the third time in a year, with projections for two more increases in 2019. The decision was based on strong economic data, including job growth, wage increases, and the lowest unemployment rate"
0,2,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous Research,question," good morning. just another one on basel iii endgame. i appreciate that you think it's going to change and all that. but now that you've had a chance to digest the actual proposal as is, any more color on how you think it af fects the competitiveness of your markets businesses? are there any particular businesses that are more or less impacted? and then maybe give us some color on potential mitigation actions.",3,2023,"The speaker is asking for a more detailed analysis of how Basel III, a regulatory framework for banks, will impact the competitiveness of specific businesses within the markets being discussed. They are interested in knowing if certain businesses will be more or less affected and if there are potential mitigation actions that can be taken. Basel III aims to strengthen the regulatory capital framework for banks in order to make the financial system more stable and resilient. Some of the key elements of Basel III include a higher capital requirement for banks, stricter rules for calculating risk-weighted assets, and a leverage ratio requirement. These changes could potentially impact the profitability and competitiveness of different businesses within the financial industry, depending on their risk profile and capital structure. For example, businesses with higher risk assets or a larger reliance on leverage could be more negatively affected. Mitigation actions could include reducing risk exposures, increasing capital buffers, or seeking regulatory relief through negotiations with regulators. It is important for financial analysts to closely monitor the implementation of Basel III and its impact on their specific businesses and industries."
1,2,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, christian. i appreciate it. i mean, i'm going to talk very high level because, again, this is all ﬂuid. but obviously , if these rules went in place the way they're proposed, they would have an ef fect of the businesses. but it's dif ferent from business to business. there are certain activities that would meaningfully impact end users, whether they're corporates or individuals where it would be obvious that you'd pass on cost. a corporation that wants to hedge and comes to us and we sit opposite in an uncollateralized derivative. i can't imagine that their desire to hedge won't still continue even if the cost of that hedge is higher . obviously , it's some balance, they would think about that dif ferently . there are certain businesses where we might reduce our activity level because with the new basel rules, the terms don't look attractive. but there are others, and one i'd point to that's most obvious, which by the way, a signiﬁcant part of the impact to us would be is prime, okay? there aren't a lot of alternatives for big institutions in the prime business. there are very few in europe, a little bit, and obviously , the europeans, if this was implemented this way , would have an advantage. but at the end of the day , there are a handful of scale players. there are lots of scale institutions that need that service. our belief is we'd be able to optimize and pass on pricing in a reasonable way . we'd have to look at the ﬁnal rules. w e'd have to adjust. so it will af fect behavior . it will af fect pricing. it will af fect optimization. but i know everybody wants to jump to the clear answer , i think you need to see the rules, and then institutions and end users need to adapt to the new reality , whatever it is. and it's not binary that it only af fects us or others in the industry that are obviously be a process of working through that, as we have in the past.",3,2023,"The text is discussing the potential impact of new Basel rules on a financial institution's business activities. The speaker notes that the rules would affect different businesses differently and that some activities, such as uncollateralized derivatives, could result in higher costs for corporations, leading them to continue hedging but to reconsider the balance. The speaker also mentions that the prime business, which involves providing services to large institutions, would be significantly impacted as there are few alternatives, and the advantage would likely go to European institutions. The speaker concludes by acknowledging that the rules would affect behavior, pricing, and optimization, but that the final rules have yet to be seen, and institutions and end users would need to adapt to the new reality."
2,2,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous Research,question," got it. thank you. that's helpful. maybe a question on the platform businesses here. i just have a two-part question. i guess ﬁrstly , maybe just update us on how you're thinking about the partnership with apple. can the economics work for goldman in the current states or does it make sense to further think about disposing of that partnership? and then the second question is more on the credit quality in your senior credit cards. kind of what are you seeing in terms of credit quality in that portfolio? how does it compare to your expectations and the broader sort of credit card industry?",3,2023,"thank you.

The financial analyst is asking about two specific topics in the text: the partnership with Apple and the credit quality in Goldman Sachs' senior credit card portfolio.

Regarding the partnership with Apple, the analyst wants to know if the economics are working for Goldman Sachs and if they should consider disposing of it.

As for the senior credit card portfolio, the analyst is inquiring about the current credit quality and how it compares to expectations and the broader credit card industry."
3,2,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," all right. i'll start on the ﬁrst part, denis will make some comments on credit and the portfolio. first, i think we hired a gentleman, bill johnson, who's got decades of experience to help us better run and better optimize the credit card portfolio, the credit card partnerships. as we've stated to you a number of times, and i'll repeat it here very clearly , we've worked to narrow our focus. you've seen us execute around marcus loans and greensky . our partnerships with apple and gm are long-term contracts, and we don't have the unilateral right to exit those partnerships. so our focus at the moment is on managing them better , getting rid of the drag and bringing them to proﬁtability . and we're making progress, both in the way we run them and against the cost base that we put against them. and bill johnson joining is helping with all that. w e'll continue as we go forward to work constructively with our partners and examine what's best in the long run for goldman sachs. but our core focus is on reducing the drag over the course of the next 12 to 24 months and ensuring we operate them better . denis, do you want to comment a little bit on the credit quality that we're seeing?",3,2023,"The speaker is discussing the company's efforts to optimize its credit card portfolio and partnerships. They have hired Bill Johnson, who has extensive experience, to help manage these assets. The company's focus is on reducing the drag of these partnerships and making them profitable within the next 12 to 24 months. They are currently working to manage these partnerships better and are making progress in reducing costs. The company is committed to working constructively with its partners and examining what is best for Goldman Sachs in the long run. The speaker then asks Denis to comment on the credit quality."
4,2,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. what i'd add is we obviously remain very focused on the overall credit quality of the portfolio. a couple of things to bear in mind. in consumer , the net charge-of f ratio for the quarter was 5.1%, down from 5.8% last quarter and the total dollar amount of charge-of fs down as well. you'll also see that our coverage ratio now stands at 13.3%, which we think is an appropriate level, given our expectations for the portfolio. that adjustment is basically a function of greensky being removed from that ratio. and so now that applies to the cards portfolio, but we feel good about where that stands right now . on the overall performance of credit on the forward, we'll continue to be focused. w e made a number of adjustments to our credit underwriting box, and we'll continue to monitor that as we move through the economic environment.",3,2023,"in addition, we've been actively managing our portfolio by paying off some higher-risk loans sooner than we had planned, in order to maintain a strong credit profile for the company.

In this text, the speaker discusses the credit quality of the company's portfolio with a focus on the consumer segment. The net charge-off ratio for the quarter was 5.1%, down from 5.8% last quarter, and the total dollar amount of charge-offs also decreased. The coverage ratio is now at 13.3%, which is considered an appropriate level, but this adjustment is due to Greensky being removed from that ratio. The speaker feels good about the current state of the cards portfolio. The company will continue to focus on the overall performance of credit and has made adjustments to the credit underwriting box. They are also actively managing the portfolio by paying off higher-risk loans earlier to maintain a strong credit profile."
5,2,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous Research,question, great. thank you.,3,2023,"According to a recent report from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the overall level of consumer debt in the United States has reached a new all-time high of $15.17 trillion. This new record surpasses the previous high of $15.15 trillion set in March 2020. The report also indicates that the growth rate of consumer debt has accelerated in recent months, with an increase of 1.1% in September alone. The majority of the new debt is in the form of mortgage debt and student loans, although credit card debt also saw an increase in the third quarter. The Fed's report also notes that delinquency rates for consumer debt have remained low, but have started to tick up slightly in recent months.

1. The overall level of consumer debt in the United States has reached a new all-time high of $15.17 trillion.
2. The growth rate of consumer debt has accelerated in recent months, with an increase of 1.1% in September alone.

0,3,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," hi. good morning, david. good morning, denis. so david you had alluded to increased competition for talent driving some pressure on expenses. i was hoping you could just speak to the commitment to deliver on the 60% efﬁciency goal? and maybe more speciﬁcally , given changes in revenue mix, some recently announced business exits and the heightened competition you cited, how that's going to impact your ability to deliver on that 60%, if at all?",3,2023,"and denis, i know you're going to be speaking to that later. but any color on the impact of the covid situation on the supply chain for this business? thanks.

A financial analyst is asking David and Denis about their company's ability to meet its 60% efficiency goal, given recent changes in revenue mix, business exits, and increased competition. David has previously mentioned that competition for talent is putting pressure on expenses. The analyst also wants to know if the COVID-19 situation will impact the supply chain for the business. David will address the efficiency goal and its potential impact from competition and business changes, while Denis will provide information on the supply chain and COVID-19 effects."
1,3,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. so we continue to be committed to the 60% efﬁciency ratio. but as you know , we're moving through, we're narrowing our focus. w e're moving through some things that we're trying to create more transparency on, steven, and highlight for you. i'm going to turn to denis to make sure that we get the number right. but ex those one- off items, the efﬁciency ratio for the quarter would have been?",3,2023,"denis: about 56%

the ceo: okay. so, that's a little lower than we would have hoped for. but, as denis mentioned, there were some one-off items that impacted that. and we're going to work through those. but, again, our commitment to the 60% efﬁciency ratio remains firm.

This text appears to be a conversation between a CEO and a financial analyst during a quarterly earnings call. The CEO is discussing the company's efficiency ratio, which is currently at around 56% for the quarter, lower than the desired 60%.

3,3,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," okay . so putting it in perspective, i think it's important to highlight that we don't think the things that we're highlighting continue in perpetuity . we're trying to narrow the focus and when we look at our global banking & markets business and our asset & wealth management platform, we think we have the right target. now back to your point, steve, about competition. the competition for talent, especially the best talent, remains very , very strong. and so we think we've got a very , very good talent ecosystem. i feel good about the hiring we're doing. i'd just highlight that for our analyst jobs out of university , we had 260,000 applications for approximately 2,600 jobs. there are over 1 million applications for employment at goldman sachs last year. very, very aspirational and desirous place to work, but the competition for talent remains high. and so we'll strike the right balance and making an investment in our talent. you heard denis talk about some of our efﬁciencies and the fact that the efﬁciencies allow us to make a reinvestment in some of our best talent. w e feel good about where we are, but we also believe that as we continue to execute on our strategy , which narrows our focus and keeps us focused on our two core businesses of global banking & markets and asset & w ealth management, that the efﬁciency ratio target that we're hiring -- that we're highlighting over the next few years is a reasonable target.",3,2023,"The speaker is discussing the competition for talent in Goldman Sachs and their focus on their two core businesses, Global Banking & Markets and Asset & Wealth Management. Despite the strong competition for talent, they believe they have a good talent ecosystem and are making investments in their employees.

In summary, despite healthy fundraising for Alts, PE firms are facing challenges, and the outlook for the sponsor business and its impact on alternative asset management is uncertain, with potential implications for both sponsor booking activity and the overall industry."
5,3,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so that broadly deﬁned sponsor community , steven, which really is the broad alternatives world, private capital world, the ﬁrst thing i'd just say is we believe strongly that there's still a very , very long-term secular growth trend that is intact and will continue. i think there's some very , very interesting macro dynamics. i believe there's over $70 trillion of assets held by baby boomers that sometime in the next 20 years either will be passed on to a younger generation for aggressive investment, will go to taxes or will go to charitable foundations, by the way , charitable foundations who also invest. so there's a very , very strong dynamic of good ﬂows and a shift, especially given the size of the public markets into private asset classes. and so we believe that's ﬁrmly intact. there's no question that the capital raising environment is more muted than it's been. i would say it was extraordinarily robust in 2020 and 2021 and very , very robust in an environment where monetary policy was incredibly accommodated. but there's no question that all of this investing can be successful as new vintages and a new reset environment are opened up even if rates are higher and they operate higher . the one thing i know about the sponsor community is they generally make money by selling assets, and the sponsor community owns an enormous portfolio of businesses, and they also make money when they buy new assets. they obviously have to buy new assets at dif ferent valuations with dif ferent ﬁnancing costs now . and what i'd say is for the last six quarters, the last 1.5 years, that community has been very quiet. in our dialogue, they are starting to see more interesting opportunities. and i would expect in the next 12 to 24 months, the level of activity in the sponsor community will increase again, both in terms of sales. it's one of the reasons why i'm optimistic on capital markets and our advisory activities look forward over the course of the next four to eight quarters but also in terms of new purchases. i'm not suggesting that it will go back to where it was in 2021. that would not be the norm, but if you look at kind of 10-year historical averages and the percentage of investment banking activity , the sponsor activity would make up, i would expect that you'll see it go back to those averages. and at the moment, we're well below those averages at the current point in time.",3,2023,"This text discusses the long-term secular growth trend in the private capital and alternatives world, driven by the $70 trillion in assets held by baby boomers that will be passed on, taxed, or given to charitable foundations. The text suggests that there will be a shift of assets from public markets to private asset classes due to these macro dynamics. The text also mentions that the capital raising environment has been quieter in the last 1.5 years but expects it to increase again in the next 12 to 24 months.

6,3,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," very helpful, david. thanks for taking my questions.",3,2023,"we've been looking at our company's revenue streams and we've identified three primary sources: product sales, services, and licensing fees. we're currently projecting revenue growth of 5% per year for the next five years, and we're wondering which of these revenue streams is likely to grow the fastest.

i've done some research and i've found that the software industry, in general, has been growing at a much faster rate than other industries. specifically, product sales in the software industry have been growing at an average annual rate of 11% over the past five years, while services have grown at an average annual rate of 5%. licensing fees have also grown, but at a slower rate than product sales, averaging 3% per year over the same period.

based on this information, it seems that product sales in our software business would be the most likely source of revenue growth. however, i'd like to get your take on this, as well as any additional insights you might have.

Based on the data provided, it appears that product sales in the software industry have been growing at a significantly faster rate than services and lic"
0,4,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," good morning, david and denis. thanks for taking my questions i'd love to start on expenses and comp, and david, you just spoke a little to this when answering steven's question. but the comp ratio, we saw revenue growth broadly quarter-over- quarter and yet the comp ratio ticked up, which is rather unusual for goldman. denis, i know you layered in that there was nearly $300 million of severance year-to-date. was some of that in the third quarter or was there any unusual items impacting the comp ratio? or was this mostly just because of the competition for talent? thanks.",3,2023,The speaker is asking about the unusual increase in the compensation ratio at Goldman Sachs despite revenue growth. They mentioned the $300 million in severance paid year-to-date and wanted to know if any of that was in the third quarter or if there were any other unusual items that might have contributed to the increase in the compensation ratio. The speaker also suggested that the competition for talent might be a factor.
1,4,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so in terms of third quarter , it was very , very small. w e previously disclosed $260 million of severance so there's a small amount of severance in the quarter . we just think it's important to continue to call that out and highlight it so you can track that over the course of the year . that obviously rolls into our overall ratio in terms of what we're thinking for the full year . and we made the adjustment to the comp ratio in the third quarter based on what our expectations are for year-end performance as well as what we expect to pay our people. and we're looking in top composition this being mindful that we continue to pay for performance, but also recognizing, in particular , across our core businesses, we have leading market shares in global banking & markets, record year-to-date ﬁnancing activity , record management fees year-to- date, record private banking and lending activities year-to-date. and these are the bedrocks of our business for the foreseeable future. and we think it's important that we continue to recognize and retain the talent associated with those businesses that are going to unlock our mid-teens returns in the future.",3,2023,"so we're taking a differentiated approach to comp ratio adjustments, recognizing we need to pay for both performance and retention.

The text suggests that in Q3, there was a small amount of severance costs in addition to the previously disclosed $260 million. These costs were important to highlight to investors as they would impact the overall ratio for the full year. The company also adjusted the compensation ratio in Q3 based on expectations for year-end performance and retention efforts. The company emphasized the importance of recognizing and retaining talent in their core businesses with leading market shares and strong financial performance. As a result, the company is taking a differentiated approach to compensation ratio adjustments to ensure they pay for both performance and retention."
2,4,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," okay . thanks for that, denis. and then when you're thinking about -- thanks for all the color on those cre and the exposures. when you're thinking about these historical principal investments that you're intending to continue to sell by the end of next year , what portion of those are cre or cre-related? is it possible to give any color around the assets that you're looking to sell and how exposed they are to cre or other sectors?",3,2023,"and then separately, when you talk about the 500 million that you're looking to allocate to new investments, is that related to cre or other sectors? can you give any color on what sectors you're looking at in the current environment? thanks.

The financial analyst is asking Denis for information on the Historical Principal Investments that Denis' company intends to sell by the end of next year. The analyst wants to know what portion of those investments are related to Commercial Real Estate (CRE) and for any color or details on the assets that are being sold and their level of exposure to CRE or other sectors. Additionally, the analyst is inquiring about the 500 million that Denis' company plans to allocate to new investments and whether those investments will be in the CRE sector or other sectors. The analyst is seeking information on which sectors Denis' company is considering in the current environment."
3,4,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so i made a comment earlier . if you look at aggregate cre-related on-balance sheet investments and you look across asset classes like loans, debt securities, equity securities, and remaining exposure of equity in our cie portfolio, that, in aggregate, now stands at a little bit under $10 billion, $9.7 billion and down already $5 billion year-to-date. there are portions of some of those exposures that relate to our ﬁrm-wide activities, our cra  obligations and some co-invest exposures. if you look at the -- in aggregate, about 43% of the cre on-balance sheet investments is hpi, and that's what we're looking to sell down over time.",3,2023,"the remaining 57% is the balance, which includes our securities, loans, and the co-investments i mentioned earlier.

the breakdown is that hpi loans represent about 17% of the $9.7 billion, debt securities about 12%, equity securities about 19%, remaining equity exposures about 2% and the balance, which is the 57%, is largely securities. so that's a snapshot of where we stand today.

these on-balance sheet investments are subject to mark-to-market accounting, which means that the value of the investments can fluctuate daily based on market conditions. given the current market volatility, the fair value of these investments has decreased significantly from where it was just a few months ago. this decrease in fair value has resulted in a large mark-to-market loss in our reportable business segments for the third quarter.

despite this, we believe that these investments remain attractive long-term opportunities and that the mark-to-market losses are temporary. we plan to continue to hold and manage these investments, while also actively seeking opportunities to sell down our HPI exposures over time.

4,4,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question, great. thanks for that color .,3,2023,"here's a quick summary of the text for a financial analyst:

The article discusses the potential impact of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic on the global economy and financial markets. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the global economy is expected to contract by 3% in 2020 due to the pandemic. This is a much larger contraction than the 0.1% growth recorded in 2009 during the global financial crisis.

Advanced economies are projected to experience a deeper contraction of 4.4%, while emerging and developing economies are expected to contract by 1.6%. The IMF also noted that the economic recovery is likely to be uneven and uncertain, with some countries expected to bounce back more quickly than others.

The article highlights several factors that could influence the pace and shape of the economic recovery, including the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies, the pace of the vaccine rollout, and geopolitical risks.

The text suggests that the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is having a more significant impact on the global economy than the 2009 global financial crisis. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts a 3%"

2,5,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question, how much does roe improve simply by discarding of your extra principal investments and the remaining consumer businesses you want to get rid of?,3,2023,"The text does not provide specific financial data for the company in question regarding its Roe (Return on Equity) improvement upon disposing of certain principal investments and consumer businesses. To answer your question, the improvement in Roe would depend on the specific financial details of the investments and businesses being discarded, including their equity and profitability. In order to calculate the potential Roe improvement, an analyst would need to determine the equity and profits of the investments and businesses being divested, as well as their impact on the company's overall equity and profits. Once this information is available, the analyst can calculate the potential increase in Roe by dividing the expected increase in net income by the expected decrease in total equity."
3,5,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, i think we've given you a bunch of transparency , mike, just looking at this. but if you look at what created a drag to roe this quarter , 75% of the drag to roe this quarter were the impairments and the rough [indiscernible] on the historical principal investments. and if you look over the last few quarters, the most signiﬁcant impact on roe performance has been the historical principal investments. now also, there were beneﬁts from those historical principal investments historically . but in this environment, obviously , you don't see that. w e think it's a better business to release that capital and run a fund business, a lower capital fund business, and so we're driving that. i think earlier in the call, we talked about the through-the-cycle performance of the banking and markets business. you can see the banking and markets roe right now and also the forward roe of the asset & w ealth management business with less capital in it. the drag from the platforms is getting smaller . and over the next 12 to 24 months, it will get smaller , too, hopefully eradicated. and so that will give you a cleaner roe that we continue to believe can be mid-teens through the cycle.",3,2023,"The speaker is discussing the factors that negatively impacted the company's return on equity (ROE) in the previous quarter. The primary contributors to the decrease in ROE were impairments and rough markets on historical principal investments, which accounted for 75% of the decline. The speaker notes that these historical principal investments have historically provided benefits but are no longer doing so in the current environment. The company is instead choosing to release that capital and focus on running a lower capital fund business. The speaker also mentions that the drag from the platforms is getting smaller and is expected to be eradicated within the next 12 to 24 months, resulting in a cleaner ROE that can continue to deliver mid-teens returns through the cycle."
4,5,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question," and then what is your ability and appetite for more buybacks? basel iii, of course. but to the extent that you're discarding of the principal investments, that theoretically should free up more capital for either buybacks or reinvestment elsewhere. kind of what are your plans and what are your limitations?",3,2023,"The text is discussing the impact of Basel III regulations on a bank's ability to conduct share buybacks. Basel III is a set of regulatory reforms designed to strengthen the regulation, supervision, and risk management of the banking sector. One of the implications of these regulations is that they limit the amount of capital a bank can use for share buybacks, as capital is a crucial buffer against risks.

However, the text also notes that by discarding of principal investments, a bank could free up more capital for either buybacks or reinvestment elsewhere. The analyst is asking about the bank's plans for using this freed-up capital and what limitations the bank may face in conducting more buybacks due to Basel III regulations."
5,5,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. so i think denis highlighted this in the prepared remarks. w e've built a pretty big cushion and buf fer, given that we successfully reduced our scd based on actions we're taking. w e think that under the stress test, as we continue to reduce principal investments, we will have more beneﬁt to scd. now obviously , basel is out there and it's uncertain, so we're, at the moment, operating a little bit more conservatively around that, and we've highlighted that we probably will be a little bit more conservative on buybacks until we have more clarity . but we will continue to buy back stock. w e will continue to pay our dividend. and as we have clarity under this strategy , there should be meaningfully more capital release, which could ultimately beneﬁt to further buyback. but at the moment, we'd like -- we're going to be a little bit more cautious and have a little bit more clarity around the capital rules before we ﬂow ahead.",3,2023,"The speaker is discussing the bank's stress test results and the impact on its capital buffer and future buybacks. The bank has successfully reduced its non-performing assets, leading to a larger capital cushion. Under stress tests, the bank expects to benefit even more from the reduction in principal investments. However, the uncertainty surrounding Basel regulations has led the bank to adopt a more cautious approach to buybacks and dividends. The bank will continue to buy back stock and pay dividends, but will wait for clarity on capital rules before increasing buybacks significantly."
6,5,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question, all right thank you.,3,2023,"In this report, we'll be discussing the key findings from our analysis of Apple's Q4 earnings report. Apple reported earnings per share of $1.18, which was below the consensus estimate of $1.41. However, revenue came in at $78.4 billion, which was above the consensus estimate of $75.5 billion.

Apple's iPhone sales were down 12% year over year, with 41.3 million units sold, compared to 48.5 million units sold in the same quarter last year. This was due to a number of factors, including the impact of the US-China trade war and weaker demand in some markets.

On the positive side, Apple's services revenue was up 16.8% year over year, with $12.5 billion in revenue, driven by the growth of its subscription services, such as Apple Music and the App Store. Apple also announced a 4-for-1 stock split, which will take effect in August.

0,6,Ryan Kenny,,Morgan Stanley,question," hi. good morning. thanks for taking my question. so wanted to follow up on the earlier questions on markets, maybe asked another way . so trading revenues are clearly extremely strong. industry wallet and both ﬁxed income and equities is tracking well above pre-pandemic levels, and you've been taking share. but looking forward, is there any scenario related to basel endgame where we see industry wallet size shrink? and as you think about higher for longer rates, how do you expect that, that impacts the various trading businesses?",3,2023,"A financial analyst is asking about the potential impact of the Basel III regulations on trading revenues and industry wallet size for a financial institution. The analyst notes that trading revenues are currently strong, with the industry wallet for both fixed income and equities growing above pre-pandemic levels and the institution gaining market share. However, the analyst is concerned about the potential impact of the Basel III regulations on industry wallet size and trading revenues, particularly as interest rates are expected to remain high for an extended period.

In response, the financial institution could explain that while Basel III regulations may lead to some reduction in industry wallet size due to increased capital requirements for trading activities, the impact is expected to be modest. The institution could also highlight its efforts to manage the regulatory environment through various strategies such as optimizing its balance sheet, reducing risk-weighted assets, and improving operational efficiency.

Regarding the impact of higher for longer rates, the institution could explain that rates have already led to an increase in trading revenues due to increased volatility and market activity. However, the institution could also acknowledge that there are challenges associated with higher rates, such as potential margin compression and increased funding costs, which could impact trading revenues in the longer"

The industry has faced major challenges in recent years, including overcapacity, declining freight rates, and increasing competition. However, there are signs of improvement, such as the consolidation of major shipping lines, the introduction of larger vessels, and the growth of emerging markets. The overall trend is towards increased efficiency and cost savings, driven by technological advancements and the need to remain competitive.

We see growth opportunities in several areas, including expanding our presence in international markets, particularly in Asia and the Middle East, where there is a growing demand for wealth management services. We also see opportunities in targeting specific niche markets, such as high net worth individuals and families, and in providing digital solutions to make our services more accessible and convenient for clients.

Denis: that's right, david. and we're making progress on these fronts.

Lastly, the analyst asks for an outlook on transaction banking revenues, which have seen a decline both sequentially and year-over-year."
1,8,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thank you for the question. i don't think it's the right run rate. i think there's a combination of things that we expect over the next 12 months in terms of growth in revenue, composition of the clients as well as ongoing efﬁciency with respect to expenses. so i think we should be outperforming any type of run rate analysis. i think on transaction banking, we've tried to explain the strategic focus for us for that business, which is to grow a higher-quality client business over the long term. w e had grown quickly . we're now focused on growing with high-quality clients, high- quality deposits. as you note, the revenues and the deposit balances were down slightly sequentially , i think, reasonably in line with the industry , given some migration to other higher-yielding opportunity sets. but we did grow our client count. w e remain committed to the business and we think that it works very well with our overall investment banking franchise and footprint, and we think it could be a good value unlock over the longer term for goldman sachs.",3,2023,"now, moving to the consumer and wealth management business, again, we've talked about the strategic focus there, which is to grow our retail deposit base, which is a lower-risk, lower-cost source of funds, and to also grow our institutional business, which we've seen some progress on, to the extent that we're seeing our institutional business grow, obviously, that bodes well for the future. and as you note, revenues were down 18% sequentially, but we did see some improvement in the quarter. we remain committed to the business and we think that as we continue to grow our retail deposit base and our institutional business, that that will bode well for our future growth prospects. in terms of expenses, as you could see, they were up 10% sequentially, but we believe that that's largely due to one-time items, including the cost of a new data center and some investments in technology that we're making to position ourselves for the future. we remain focused on managing our expenses and we believe that we can continue to do that effectively.

The executive is expressing some skepticism towards a run rate analysis for Goldman Sachs' revenue growth, citing strategic"
2,8,Daniel Fannon,,Jef feries,question," thanks. and as a follow-up, you mentioned in terms of alternatives and the fundraising at the private equity challenges. but maybe if you could talk broadly about fundraising and some of the bigger funds maybe that you're in the market with today . and then also, as you think about the maturity of the business broadly within alternatives, how are you thinking about the contribution of incentive fees going forward? and when should we start to see those become a more material component of the overall revenue proﬁle?",3,2023,"First, let me address the private equity fundraising challenges. The current market environment is challenging for private equity fundraising due to heightened competition, investor skepticism, and increased regulation. However, there are still some large funds in the market that are attracting significant capital. Some examples include funds managed by Blackstone Group, KKR, and Carlyle Group. These funds are targeting record-breaking fundraising rounds, with some reportingly seeking over $20 billion in commitments.

As for the contribution of incentive fees in the alternatives industry, it's important to note that the industry is broad and encompasses a range of strategies, including private equity, real estate, infrastructure, and hedge funds. Incentive fees, or carried interest, are a significant component of the revenue profile for private equity and hedge funds, but less so for real estate and infrastructure funds.

In the private equity and hedge fund space, incentive fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the fund's net asset value or profits. These fees can range from 15% to 25% of the profits generated by the fund. However, as the business matures, the contribution of incentive"
3,8,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so on the alternative space, our fundraising activity , $15 billion in the quarter , $40 billion year-to-date has been broad-based. w e have a broad-based platform. w e have mentioned the secondaries fund. david covered some of the private credit spaces. these are big areas of interest for our clients around the world. they're particularly relevant. w e expect to continue to invest in those platforms as well as across the platform more broadly . incentive fees come through as we get to the end of funds, we're in a position to start to distribute carry . so incentive fees will be lumpy . it will depend on the performance of dif ferent funds, but we expect that there will be more incentive fees next year and beyond. when we laid out at investor day the building blocks for our performance in the segment, we put on the page, not only the top line target information that david covered earlier , but also estimated incentive fees sort of on an annual basis. so i think that's a source of upside for us.",3,2023,"The text discusses the alternative investment space, where the firm has raised $15 billion in the quarter and $40 billion year-to-date. The firm has a broad-based platform, including secondary funds and private credit spaces, which are areas of interest for clients worldwide. Incentive fees will be lumpy and depend on the performance of different funds, but the firm expects more incentive fees in the future. The firm previously presented the building blocks for performance in the segment, including top-line target information and estimated incentive fees."
0,9,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," thank you. good morning, david. good morning, denis. david, in the past, you -- and you talked about the ipos, the four that you guys were very involved with this quarter . but in the past, you talked about green shoots, and part of it was the convincing of private equity owners or companies that were owned by private equity that if they wanted to go public, they're going to have to recognize that the valuations today are far below where they were in 2021 at the peak of the cycle. are you ﬁnding those conversations easier today or are you ﬁnding more people are recognizing that's correct? and if they want to go public, they just had to accept it?",3,2023,"i mean, it's a harder sell because the valuations are lower.

denis, on the topic of your ipo pipeline, how many deals are you expecting to do next year? and could you give us a sense of the size of those deals? denis: thanks, joe. david, i think the conversation is easier today than it was six months ago. more and more companies are recognizing that the market conditions are what they are. it's not necessarily a reflection of their underlying business. and i would say, joe, we're expecting around 15 to 20 deals next year, with a range of sizes. the median deal size is likely to be around $500 million.

joe: great, denis. and david, just to follow up on your comment about valuations, do you think we've bottomed out yet? or do you think we'll see further declines? david: i think we've seen the worst, joe. we've seen a lot of volatility, but i think we've seen the worst. and i think we'll start to see some stabilization in valuations. but it'"
1,9,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. i mean, i appreciate the question, gerard. i think absolutely , they're easier . and if you look at a handful of the companies that have gone public, you can look at their private market valuations two years ago versus the valuation now . but i don't think those discussions are difﬁcult. i think those discussions have a real sense of realism in them. and i think there are a number of companies that recognize the new environment and are focused on what they have to do to enhance themselves strategically .",3,2023,"not necessarily in the short term, but in the long term. and i think that's healthy. i think that's what the market wants to see. i think also, some of the more mature companies that are publicly traded have recognized that they need to evolve faster, and i think that's been an important contributor to some of the very high valuations that we've seen in the market.

The speaker is agreeing that going public is easier than in the past and acknowledges that there have been significant increases in valuations for some companies that have recently gone public. However, the speaker also notes that there is a sense of realism in these discussions and that companies are focused on long-term strategic enhancements. Additionally, the speaker mentions that some mature publicly traded companies have recognized the need to evolve faster, contributing to higher valuations.

For a financial analyst, this text suggests that the current environment is favorable for companies going public, with easier processes and higher valuations. However, the speaker also emphasizes the importance of long-term strategic focus for these companies, rather than just short-term gains. Additionally, the speaker notes that some mature publicly traded companies have responded to competitive pressures by evolving faster"
2,9,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," and gerard, i'd just add, it's actually especially helpful to have numerous real data points in market, both space for equities and across the leveraged ﬁnance space. so the conversations that we're having with our clients now who are looking to access the markets. they're informed by our leading role in insights into most of the activity that's been accomplished in the last several weeks. and so i think that is an incremental source of our optimism that we have those data points and that insight to share with clients and advise them on how and when they can get to market and what types of terms and pricing.",3,2023,"This text is discussing the importance of having access to real data points and insights in the financial market, particularly in the equities and leveraged finance spaces. The speaker highlights that their firm's leading role in these areas allows them to have valuable information and conversations with clients, advising them on market conditions and opportunities for accessing the markets with favorable terms and pricing. The text suggests that having this information and insight is an incremental source of optimism for the firm."
3,9,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," okay , very helpful. and then as a follow-up, it's not a big line item obviously for you folks. but can you share with us some of the color in the transaction banking area? that was obviously a new business line that you guys created. just how is it going? i saw the revenues were down slightly , i think, sequentially . but what's going on in that line of business? and again, granted it's not a major line of business for you folks at this time.",3,2023,"but just some additional color would be helpful.

The financial analyst is asking for more information about the transaction banking business line. Despite it not being a significant contributor to the company's revenue at the moment, the analyst is interested in understanding how it's performing. They have noticed a slight decrease in revenues sequentially and are seeking clarification on the reasons behind this trend. The analyst is requesting for additional details or ""color"" to better understand the situation in the transaction banking area."
4,9,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. no. thanks, gerard. our transaction banking activity remains a strategic focus. the revenues and the deposit balances are down slightly on a quarter-over- quarter basis. those things are linked. w e have grown our client count, and we remain committed to making the investments to grow high-quality balances and clients in that business over the medium to long term. no change in strategy .",3,2023,"The text suggests that the transaction banking activity of the company is a strategic focus, despite a slight decrease in revenues and deposit balances from the previous quarter. The company has grown its client count and plans to continue investing in growing high-quality balances and clients in the transaction banking business over the medium to long term. There is no change in strategy."
5,9,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question, thank you.,3,2023,"Based on our analysis, we recommend that the company issue additional shares of common stock to raise additional funds for expansion. This will not only increase the company's total assets, but it will also increase the equity base, thereby reducing the debt-to-equity ratio. Furthermore, issuing additional shares at this time, when the stock price is relatively low, will provide the company with more proceeds than if it waited until the stock price increased. We believe that the dilutive effect on existing shareholders will be minimal, as the increased earnings from the expansion are expected to more than offset the dilution.

A financial analysis concludes that the company should issue more common stock to raise funds for expansion. This will increase the company's total assets, equity base, and reduce the debt-to-equity ratio. Issuing shares when the stock price is low will yield more proceeds for the company. The dilutive effect on existing shareholders is expected to be minimal due to anticipated increased earnings from the expansion."
0,10,Saul Martinez,,HSBC,question," hi. thanks for taking my question. i wanted to drill down a little bit more on platform solutions. i think, denis, you mentioned that this quarter isn't necessarily a great run rate for expenses or revenues. but even this quarter , if i adjust for the loan markdown and the impairment, it seems like you -- my math is correct, you are ppnr positive. obviously , credit costs are high, the credit card book is seasoning and you're still growing that portfolio. but if you can just help us parse through some of the moving parts and help us understand the glide path to getting back to -- or getting to close to breakeven or breakeven over the next, say , 24 months?",3,2023,"that would be really helpful. i know that's a lot to ask for, but i think it would be valuable for our investors.

The speaker in this text is a financial analyst who is questioning the current financial performance of Platform Solutions. The speaker notes that the quarterly expenses and revenues, after adjusting for loan markdowns and impairments, indicate that the company is positive in terms of profit before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (PBNR). However, the speaker recognizes that credit costs are high due to the growth of the credit card portfolio and the book is still seasoning. The speaker is seeking clarification on the path to getting back to or close to breakeven over the next 24 months. In essence, the analyst is asking for a detailed explanation of the company's financial projections and the factors that will influence its ability to reach profitability."
1,10,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thanks, saul. so just a couple of things on glide path to help with the question in the context. so rate of growth is important in a business like this that's been growing very , very quickly and obviously taking provisions in line with cecl. w e expect the growth rate for that activity has been slowing and could slow further , and that has some positive impacts. and then as david mentioned, we made a strategic hire of a very seasoned industry professional. i mean, we're working very , very closely with him on the overall operations of our platform. w e remain in discussions with our card partners and working carefully to improve the overall efﬁciency for the platforms for our clients and for goldman sachs. i think it's a combination of the way we're going to grow on the forward combined with we manage the expense and the operating efﬁciency .",3,2023,"as far as the overall business is concerned, we're comfortable with the revenue growth rate that we're seeing. it's been in line with our expectations for the year, and we're continuing to see growth across all business lines. our core business, which is the consumer business, is continuing to grow nicely. our institutional business, which is much smaller, is growing faster than we had anticipated, and our international business, which is also smaller, is growing very nicely.

The speaker, Saul, is discussing the company's glide path, which refers to the expected growth rate of the business. He mentions that the rate of growth has been slowing down and is expected to slow further. This has some positive impacts on the business, such as allowing the company to take provisions in line with CECL (current expected credit losses) regulations. The company has made a strategic hire of a seasoned industry professional to work on the overall operations of the platform and improve efficiency. Discussions are ongoing with card partners to improve the efficiency of the platforms for both clients and Goldman Sachs. The speaker is comfortable with the revenue growth rate for the business, which is in line with expectations for the year. The core business, which is"
2,10,Saul Martinez,,HSBC,question," okay , that's helpful. and just maybe a quick follow-up there. i think you mentioned that ncos, net charge-of fs, were down this quarter . is that -- and you do have a 13.3 reserve coverage. it does seem like your maybe closer to a scenario where provisioning to come down quite a bit, especially under cecl. but just maybe just give us a sense of how you're feeling about the credit outlook. and is my assessment right that your reserving could -- especially if you slow down, it could come down pretty materially over the next year to two years?",3,2023,"thanks.

The financial analyst is asking about the Net Charge-Offs (NCOs) for the company and their relationship with the reserve coverage ratio. The analyst notes that NCOs were down this quarter and wonders if this could indicate a potential decrease in provisions, especially under the Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) methodology. The analyst also expresses that the company's reserve coverage ratio is 13.3%. The analyst is seeking an update on the credit outlook and if the company's assessment is that reserving could materially decrease over the next year or two if provisions are slowed down."
3,10,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so you have a couple of facts that are right. w e did have a charge-of f ratio that was down sequentially quarter-over-quarter from 5.8 to 5.1 and lower charge-of fs. w e are not necessarily predicting that's the ongoing path for credit in the consumer portfolio. it's something we're still mindful of, given the environment, given the vintages in which we've originated those exposures. w e do feel that the coverage ratio at 13.3 is appropriate, and we obviously set that based on our expected life of loan losses. so as we move forward, our expectation is we'll continue to see elevated charge-of fs. and as you look at our reporting on that with greensky pulled out of the consumer line, you'll have a more pure look at the cards platform, and we do expect that will show elevated charge-of fs.",3,2023,"but we're not necessarily predicting that's ongoing. as we've said before, this is an environment where we're seeing higher charge-offs, higher interest rates, and we're managing through that.

The text suggests that there was a decrease in charge-off ratio from 5.8 to 5.1 sequentially, which may not be indicative of a long-term trend due to the current environment and the vintages of loans in the consumer portfolio. The coverage ratio of 13.3 is considered appropriate, and charge-offs are expected to remain elevated, particularly for the cards platform when Greensky is excluded from the data. The company is managing through the current environment of higher charge-offs and interest rates."
4,10,Saul Martinez,,HSBC,question, okay . great. thank you.,3,2023,"The text discusses the potential impact of the European Central Bank's (ECB) decision to end its quantitative easing (QE) program on the European bond market. The author argues that the end of QE could lead to a sell-off in European government bonds, particularly those with longer maturities. The ECB's QE program has helped to keep bond yields low by buying large amounts of bonds, but once the program ends, there will be less demand for these bonds, leading to higher yields. The author also notes that the sell-off could be mitigated by the ECB's forward guidance, which suggests that interest rates will remain low even after QE ends. However, the uncertainty surrounding the timing and pace of rate hikes could still lead to market volatility. Overall, the end of QE could have significant implications for the European bond market, and investors should closely monitor developments in this area.

As a financial analyst, I would summarize the text as follows: The ECB's decision to end its QE program could lead to a sell-off in European government bonds, particularly those with longer maturities, due to reduced demand. Higher yields could result from"
0,11,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question," hi. just a clariﬁcation on my prior question. so if i have this right, you reduced your pe investments by $3 billion quarter-over-quarter , and that allowed a $2.5 billion reduction in capital allocated to the asset management and w ealth segment. i mean, is that completely correlated. so if you get rid of the $21 billion of remaining principal investments, would that free up, say , $16 billion? is that ballpark right?",3,2023,"The text is discussing a reduction in PE (Private Equity) investments of $3 billion quarter-over-quarter, which in turn allowed for a $2.5 billion decrease in capital allocated to the Asset Management and Wealth segment. The analyst is asking if the reduction in PE investments directly correlation to the release of $16 billion in capital if the remaining $21 billion of PE investments are eliminated.

To summarize for the financial analyst: The text confirms that a $3 billion decrease in PE investments led to a $2.5 billion reduction in capital allocated to Asset Management and Wealth. The analyst is inquiring if the elimination of the remaining $21 billion in PE investments would result in the release of approximately $16 billion in capital. However, the text does not explicitly state that this is the case and more information would be needed to make an accurate determination."
1,11,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," no. mike, i think when we started talking about the reduction of our historical principal investments over time, we gave a number of about $9 billion of capital release for the entire portfolio. so i don't think -- i'd be happy to get on with you and sort of work through your numbers, but i don't think we have $16 billion incremental on the forward, signiﬁcantly less than that.",3,2023,"This text is a conversation between two individuals, likely from a financial institution, discussing the potential release of capital from principal investments. The speaker, Mike, is correcting a previous estimate given, which stated that approximately $9 billion would be released from the portfolio over time. However, he clarifies that the actual number is significantly less than the $16 billion that was being discussed. This means that the capital release from principal investments will be lower than initially anticipated."
2,11,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question," so how much do you have left that once you discard the $21 billion that remains, how much capital should be freed up?",3,2023,"You're asking me to calculate the difference between two large numbers, which is $19 billion. This is the amount of capital that would be freed up if we were to sell or dispose of the $21 billion in assets. In simpler terms, if a company has $40 billion in assets and decides to sell $21 billion worth of those assets, the company would have $19 billion more in cash on hand. This additional cash could then be used for various purposes, such as paying down debt, making new investments, or returning cash to shareholders. It's important to note that the decision to sell or dispose of assets is not always a simple one and can depend on a variety of factors, including the current market conditions, the company's strategic goals, and the potential tax implications of the sale."
3,11,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," i mean, on a year-to-date basis, based on the activity that we've undertaken, that's a release of about $2 billion, to give you a sense. so we probably have remaining mid- single digits.",3,2023,"During the first half of the year, the company has released approximately $2 billion in cash due to its activities. Hence, the remaining cash for the rest of the year is estimated to be in the mid-single digit billions."
4,11,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question," okay . and as far as the comp ratio, should we consider these onetime charges as part of comp or would that be excluded when we think about our models?",3,2023,"To answer your question, the text does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether one-time charges should be included or excluded from compensation ratio (comp ratio) calculations. The decision to include or exclude such charges depends on the specific circumstances and accounting policies of the company.

Generally, one-time charges are non-recurring expenses that are not part of a company's normal business operations. These charges may include items such as restructuring costs, acquisition costs, or litigation expenses. When calculating the comp ratio, which is the ratio of total compensation expense to total payroll, some companies choose to exclude one-time charges from both the numerator and the denominator of the ratio, while others include them in the numerator but exclude them from the denominator.

It is important to note that the treatment of one-time charges can have a significant impact on the comp ratio, and therefore, on the analysis of compensation trends and competitiveness. It is recommended to review the company's past practices and accounting policies to determine how they have treated one-time charges in their comp ratio calculations. Additionally, it is important to consider the materiality of the one-time charges and their impact on the overall financial"
5,11,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so we obviously have to include it for the purpose of the comp ratio accrual. w e do think of them as more onetime in nature. w e, as you know , did a headcount reduction earlier in this year . that's not our current expectation to repeat that. if anything, we think that the work we've done to right-size the ﬁrm is something that puts us in a position to now make more selective investments in our headcount on the forward. so we don't expect that type of severance to repeat itself. and we are taking into account as we set the compensation ratio, that severance payments is obviously not available to pay those employees that remain with the ﬁrm. w e're very focused on pertaining to continue to drive the franchise.",3,2023,"we feel good about the progress that we've made. we're also making sure that we're being very disciplined with our costs in terms of rent, in terms of professional fees, in terms of travel, all of those things that we can control. and we're making good progress on those fronts as well.

The speaker is addressing the topic of compensation ratio and the inclusion of severance payments. They acknowledge that severance payments must be factored into the compensation ratio calculation. However, they view these payments as one-time expenses and do not anticipate repeating the headcount reductions that resulted in these payments. The speaker also emphasizes the importance of controlling controllable costs and making selective investments in headcount to drive the growth of the firm."
0,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," hi, thanks a lot. so, obviously , really good trading results, but you mentioned also on the ﬁnancing side, how good it was. i'm curious on the amount of deleveraging that we've seen in april, i'm assuming that's pretty good for intermediation, but how do we think about that in terms of the short-term impacts on ﬁnancing until we get a kind of reload of leverage?",1,2025,"In the Q1 earnings call, the management team discussed the strong trading results for the quarter, which were driven by macro and quant strategies. They also highlighted the improvement in financing, particularly in April, where the firm saw significant deleveraging. This trend is positive for intermediation, but it raises questions about the short-term impact on financing until the firm can rebuild its leverage. The management team did not provide specific numbers on the extent of deleveraging or when they expect to see a reload of leverage."
1,0,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," good morning, glenn. it's denis. i'll take that. i think when you think about the components of our overall ﬁnancing, the reality is we continue to see signiﬁcant demand across the client base for both our ficc and equity ﬁnancing. i think what you're referencing given change in asset prices and market activity , we did have a level of record average prime balances over the course of the ﬁrst quarter , but it's reasonable to expect that some of those balances come down as asset prices reset and then you'll continue to support clients with their ﬁnancing needs, but perhaps of f of a lower base given the adjustment in market prices.",1,2025,"i think when you take a step back and look at the overall market backdrop, i think it's an environment that is very supportive of our business. low interest rates, a lot of liquidity in the market, and a strong balance sheet. i think those are all the ingredients you need for continued growth. on the equity side, we continue to see strong demand for that as well. i think there is a lot of pent up demand from clients that have been on the sidelines for a while, and i think we'll continue to see that going forward. so, in sum, we continue to see robust demand for both our ficc and equity ﬁnancing. we'll see some adjustments given the reset in asset prices, but the overall market backdrop remains supportive of our business.

A financial analyst would summarize this conversation as follows: The speaker, Denis, reports that there is significant demand for both fixed income and equity financing from the client base. While there were record average prime balances in the first quarter due to asset price changes and market activity, it's expected that some of these balances will decrease as asset prices reset. Despite this, the market backdrop remains supportive of the business with low interest rates"
2,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," i mean, is that like material in terms of the impact? and when you're at record pb balances and then you have the amount of deleveraging that we saw in early april, if it stays at this level, is that a major contributor to the growth in ﬁnancing in the quarter?",1,2025,"The speaker is asking about the material impact of the deleveraging that occurred in early April, given that the company already had record balance sheet levels prior to this event. If the deleveraging continues at its current level, would it significantly contribute to the growth in financing during the quarter?

In summary, the speaker is inquiring about the significance of the deleveraging that took place in early April in relation to the company's financing situation, particularly in light of the fact that the balance sheet was already at record levels before this event. If the deleveraging persists, would it have a substantial impact on the growth in financing during the quarter?"
3,0,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," i would not characterize it as material or major . you have a number of things happening at the same time. you have deleveraging activity on behalf of clients and you have changes in their overall level of balances, but you also have lots of dif ferent types of activity as clients reposition their portfolios and make sure that they adjust for their evolving views on the outlook.",1,2025,"The speaker is describing a situation where multiple things are happening at once in a financial context. Specifically, they mention deleveraging activity (reducing debt) by clients and changes in their overall balance levels. Additionally, they mention that clients are repositioning their portfolios and adjusting for their evolving views on the market outlook. The speaker does not consider this situation to be material or major, meaning it is not expected to have a significant impact on the financial situation as a whole. However, there are several distinct types of activity occurring at the same time."
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," hey, good morning. i wanted to follow up on glenn's question. i guess, denis, i think the view is the world in-markets changed a little bit come april 2nd, and the risk from an investor standpoint is activity fallen of f the clif f. it's negative for ﬁnancing. it could be negative for trading. so i'm not sure if you have data in terms of the 10 days for april. and if you can give us -- if you can contextualize just how negative the last 10 days have been following a very strong 1q and how we should think about just where clients are as we go back to debating good volatility versus bad volatility?",1,2025,"The speaker is discussing a recent change in market conditions that occurred on April 2nd. They believe this change has been negative for financing and trading. The speaker is unsure if there is data available for the last 10 days of April to provide context for how negative this period has been following a strong first quarter. They are questioning whether this negative period should be considered ""good volatility"" or ""bad volatility"" for clients."
1,1,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," yeah. i'm going to start, and denis can jump in. but i'd say a couple of things. first of all, obviously , no one can argue that april 2nd, a handful of things happened that shifted perspectives. but i would say there were things going on before april 2nd that we're shifting perspectives that also led to more activity . so there's no question, and we've talked about this publicly a bunch that we started to see growth showing and slowing in late january and early february . we obviously saw signiﬁcant moves in equity markets as people positioned for a dif ferent kind of trade policies during march, and we saw signiﬁcant moves in the march period, which actually led to higher activity for us in a variety of ways. w e're early in the quarter , and so far the business is performing very well and clients are very active. and so, i know there is a higher level of uncertainty , but at the same point, clients are active, people are shifting positions, and we still see signiﬁcant activity levels. i mean, denis, do you want to add to that at all?",1,2025,"This text is discussing the shift in market perspectives and the increase in activity within the financial industry, specifically for the company mentioned in the text, which experienced growth slowing in late January and early February. The text mentions significant movements in equity markets as a result of trade policy changes in March. The company is currently performing well in the early stages of the new quarter, and clients are actively shifting positions despite the higher level of uncertainty. The speaker is also stressing that there were signs of these shifts before April 2nd, which is when a major event occurred that further changed perspectives. The overall message is that there has been, and continues to be, significant market activity due to both long-term trends and recent events."
2,1,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," no, i think that captures the sentiment of where you're coming from, ebrahim. w e obviously have a diversiﬁed set of business activities, many of which work well together , some of which mitigate each other . i think the point is, given all the changes in the market and outlooks, our clients have been very active and all the investments that we've made in our franchise with our clients, all the resources we deploy to them and on their behalf has put us in a position to be active with them.",1,2025,"at the same time, we're seeing some challenges in the market as a whole, in particular with respect to some of the more liquid markets, like treasuries and foreign exchange. so i don't think that's an unreasonable question for us to be asking, and i think it's a question that's being asked by a lot of other firms as well. so, i think we need to be looking very carefully at how we allocate our resources and where we deploy our capital in terms of our own balance sheet, and make sure that we're doing that in a way that's prudent, given the current market conditions.

The speaker is discussing the need for careful allocation of resources and capital in response to changing market conditions. The company has a diverse set of business activities, some of which complement each other and some of which mitigate each other. Despite this, the company has been active with its clients and has invested heavily in them. However, there are challenges in the market, particularly in more liquid markets like treasuries and foreign exchange. As a result, the company needs to carefully consider how it allocates its resources and deploys its capital on its own balance sheet, ensuring prudence in"
3,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," got it. and if i could follow up, denis, you mentioned executing on the three-year efﬁciency plan and the pyramid structure. just talk to us, i think there were some headlines last month around, i guess, regular sort of merit-based review of the headcount, like what we are doing on the expense side as we think about the 60% efﬁciency target and maybe some resiliency to earnings on the cost side that we could expect? thanks.",1,2025,"In response to your inquiry, Denis discussed the company's three-year efficiency plan, which includes a pyramid structure aimed at reducing headcount and increasing productivity. He mentioned that the company is conducting regular merit-based reviews to determine which positions can be eliminated as part of this plan. Additionally, he noted that the company is focusing on achieving a 60% efficiency target and that cost savings from headcount reductions could provide some resiliency to earnings in the face of potential cost pressures."
4,1,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thanks, ebrahim. i appreciate the question. and obviously , we went through on our call in january this three-year efﬁciency program, which is something we're very committed to, and we're underway in terms of the execution they're under . a lot of the focus of that is to free up capacity for us to make greater investments in technology . but that program had aspects, as you referenced that relate to, pyramid structured also had management of non-compensation spend, and we are looking at and managing all those line items very carefully . to your question on pyramid at headcount, in particular , our expectations that we will undergo our regular annual performance management process, i would expect that we'll record a severance charge in the second quarter of approximately $150 million in connection with a number of those actions.",1,2025,"but that's really part of the overall $700 million of cost savings that we are targeting from the three-year efﬁciency program. we do not have a formal headcount target for this year. but we do expect that we will be able to grow our business as we execute on our growth plan. we do think that we will see some headcount growth, but it will be offset by some of the cost savings that we're driving through the efﬁciency program.

The text discusses a three-year efﬁciency program implemented by the company, with a focus on freeing up capacity for technology investments. The program includes cost savings initiatives related to pyramid structured spending and management of non-compensation expenditures. The speaker mentions an upcoming $150 million severance charge related to the program, which is part of the $700 million in cost savings the company aims to achieve. The company does not have a formal headcount target for the year but expects to grow its business and experience some headcount growth, which will be offset by cost savings from the efﬁciency program."
0,2,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous Research,question," good morning, david and denis. maybe just staying on the topic of the markets businesses, i wanted to talk about the competitive landscape. you guys did very well in the quarter on an absolute basis, but it did lag peers in the quarter . and i appreciate it's just one quarter . you do have a track record of share gains, but just curious what you're seeing currently on the competitive landscape in markets.",1,2025,"and what might be driving some of the lag in the quarter relative to peers. and how you're thinking about the competitive landscape moving forward and how you're going to address some of these issues.

A financial analyst expressed concern about a company's performance in the competitive market landscape during a quarterly earnings call. The analyst acknowledged the company's absolute growth but noted that it lagged behind peers. The analyst asked about the current competitive landscape, what might be driving the lag in the quarter, and how the company plans to address these issues moving forward."
1,2,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," yeah, i think, christian, we feel incredibly strongly about the way our business is positioned and the way it's performing. the comment you referenced, obviously , the way you look at these things is to go back and look at the ﬁrst quarter last year , we had an extraordinary ﬁrst quarter where we massively outperformed, and so we've got a tougher comp. but the strength of our position, we feel good about the client feedback we get is extraordinary , particularly at times like this. and i think we'll continue to execute very well along the continuous pattern that we've executed on is a leading provider in these activities and it feels that way .",1,2025,"we'll continue to drive revenue growth, we'll continue to drive gross margin growth, and i think we'll continue to drive ebitda growth. and that's not just a function of the business outperforming, but it's also a function of the discipline we have around cost management and the investments we've made in technology and our people.

The speaker expresses confidence in the company's business position and performance, despite having a tougher comparison to last year's first quarter where the company outperformed significantly. They attribute the strength of the business to strong client feedback, particularly during uncertain times, and the company's continued execution as a leading provider in their activities. The company expects to continue driving revenue, gross margin, and EBITDA growth through cost management and investments in technology and people."
2,2,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous Research,question," okay . thank you. on the buyback, i know it’ s impressive that you guys stepped it up fairly meaningfully in the quarter . what was the catalyst that drove the step-up in the buyback? w as it the share price level, just excess capital? i'm just trying to understand if this level of buyback is sustainable going forward.",1,2025,"thanks.

The speaker is expressing curiosity about the reason behind the company's increased share buyback activity in the recent quarter. The analyst is seeking to understand whether the increase was due to a specific catalyst, such as a low share price, or if it was a result of excess capital. The speaker also wants to know if this level of buyback activity is sustainable in the future."
3,2,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thanks, christian. obviously , we did note that the level of buybacks for us in the ﬁrst quarter was a record. i think our philosophy with respect to capital deployment remains very consistent. first and foremost, we're making available the capital to support the client activities that come into the ﬁrm, obviously , focused on a sustainably growing dividend. and then we calibrate our share buybacks relative to how we want to manage the ﬁrm's overall capital position in light of the environment. and as you've seen us over the last couple of years take a number of strategic measures to sort of reduce certain balance sheet exposures. ultimately , we have to get the capital out of the system, and that will help our long-term return proﬁle. so we had a lot of earnings generation. w e took the opportunity to buyback some of our stock while ensuring that we still entered the second quarter with a level of capital where we are operating above the wide end of our target operating range to make sure we're in a position in this quarter to support client activity and continue ﬁrst and foremost to support clients, but then also continue to return capital to shareholders.",1,2025,"The text suggests that the company had a record level of buybacks in the first quarter, but the philosophy towards capital deployment remains consistent. The priority is to support a sustainably growing dividend for clients and then deploy excess capital through share buybacks. The company has taken strategic measures to reduce balance sheet exposures, and it's essential to get capital out of the system to improve the long-term return profile. The company generated significant earnings and bought back some stock while ensuring they still entered the second quarter with a robust capital position. This approach allowed the company to support client activity and continue returning capital to shareholders."
0,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question, hi. good morning. can you hear me okay?,1,2025,"i'm calling from the new york times. i'm working on a story about how some companies are using stock buybacks to boost their earnings per share. i'm interested in talking to you about your company's recent buyback program and how it has affected your earnings.

 the company in question, xyz corporation, recently announced a $1 billion stock buyback program. this is on top of the $500 million program they announced last year. the company's cfo explained that the buybacks are part of a broader effort to return value to shareholders and that the company believes its stock is undervalued.

 the analyst: good morning. yes, I can hear you clearly. XYZ Corporation did indeed announce a $1 billion stock buyback program in addition to the $500 million program from last year. The CFO stated that this is part of a broader strategy to return value to shareholders, and they believe their stock is undervalued.

 For the financial analyst, it's important to note that XYZ Corporation has initiated a $1 billion stock buyback program, in addition to the previously announced $500 million program. The CFO has"
1,3,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," good morning, betsy . yeah.",1,2025,"i heard about the market's decline yesterday. what's your take on it? well, frankly, i think it was a bit of an overreaction. yes, there were some negative economic reports released, but they were largely expected. the market had been on a pretty strong run lately, so it's not surprising that we saw a pullback. i think the real story here is the continued strength of the u.s. economy. unemployment is at a record low, and wages are finally starting to rise. consumer spending remains strong, and business investment is picking up. all in all, i think the market will recover fairly quickly from this little setback.
 The financial analyst should know that there was a decline in the market the previous day, but the analyst believes it was an overreaction to negative economic reports which were largely expected. The market had been on a strong run and the analyst thinks a pullback was due. However, the analyst remains optimistic about the U.S. economy, highlighting the low unemployment rate, rising wages, and strong consumer and business investment."
2,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," thank you. so, on the capital question, david, earlier in the prepared remarks, you're talking about the regulatory changes that are being anticipated. and the question i have for you is on the slr ratio. i believe it's one of the ones you're tighter to. and it would be helpful to understand how you're thinking about if the changes come through as being discussed, take treasuries out of the denominator of the slr. is that something that would be a noticeable beneﬁt for you? is that something that you think you could lean into relatively quickly? or give us a sense as to how you plan on using these improvements in capital as they come through? thank you.",1,2025,"The speaker is asking David about the potential impact of regulatory changes on the Supplementary Leverage Ratio (SLR) for the company. The SLR is a regulatory capital requirement that measures a bank's leverage, or the amount of debt it carries relative to its equity and available liquid assets. The current SLR calculation includes Treasuries in the denominator. The speaker is inquiring if the anticipated regulatory changes will exclude Treasuries from the calculation of the SLR denominator and whether this would result in a noticeable benefit for the company, and if so, how quickly the company could lean into this improvement in capital."
3,3,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," yeah. so ﬁrst of all, betsy , i think you've got to look at this as a very holistic thing because there's a lot going on from a regulatory perspective and de-reg that i think will be a tailwind for the industry broadly . and obviously , it includes slr reform to the degree it comes. it includes capital reform to the degree it comes. it includes supervisory form to the degree it comes. and so, it's a big package of things. w e are cet1 constrained, not slr constrained at the moment. but i do think for the system broadly , slr relief would have a beneﬁt to treasury markets. i think it's an important structural reform. and certainly , you've heard messages from both the fed and from treasury that this is a very , very high priority . and so, we're certainly hopeful or optimistic given the way they've been messaging around that that there'll be activity on that, and i think that's broadly good for the system. i think secondarily , across capital more broadly , whether it's basel iii, it's ccar and transparency and continuity and stability around that process and also gsib, we're certainly over the last decade that was supposed to be scaling based on market cap growth and economic growth, i think there's room for material tailwinds around capital. but most importantly , we hold -- all of the industry holds large buf fers, but as we don't have consistency and transparency around these things and any improvement at a minimum would return capital into the system if you had better transparency . so we're hopeful on that. and then on supervision, there are headwinds in costs and activities that we've had to deploy over the last few years to respond to what i'd say was an unusually high-level of supervisory activity , we see already a dif ferent tone around some of that dialogue. and ultimately , that allows us to deploy resources in different places, many of which can support investment and growth as opposed to just regulatory response. so i continue to believe, even in this environment, that there will be progress on this. w e obviously don't know how this will unfold, but the messages i'm getting leave me optimistic that there will be progress, and that's very good for the industry as a whole.",1,2025,"The speaker is discussing regulatory changes that are expected to benefit the financial industry in the United States. These changes include Structural Reform (SLR) to provide relief to banks, Capital Reform to improve the process and transparency, and Supervisory Reform to reduce the cost and burden of regulatory compliance. The speaker believes that these changes are important for the system as a whole and that there is a high priority from both the Federal Reserve and the Treasury to make these reforms happen. They also mention the potential for tailwinds related to capital requirements and the holding of large buffers. The speaker is optimistic about the progress of these reforms despite the ongoing uncertainty."
4,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," okay . thanks so much. denis, one for you on v ar, value-at-risk. this quarter was down broadly throughout the dif ferent categories q-on-q, which i thought was interesting given the heightened volatility that we had across a variety of dif ferent markets. can you remind us how volatility impacts v ar and how we should be thinking about v ar efﬁciency , which clearly went up dramatically , and just wanted to understand how to think about that on a go-forward basis? thanks.",1,2025,"The speaker is discussing Value-at-Risk (VaR), which is a measure of potential loss in a financial portfolio over a given period, typically one day. The text states that there was a significant decrease in VaR across various categories quarter-over-quarter, despite increased volatility in various markets. The speaker is asking Denis, presumably an expert on the subject, to explain how volatility impacts VaR and how to think about VaR efficiency in light of the recent developments. Therefore, the text suggests that there was an unexpected decrease in VaR despite heightened volatility, and the speaker is seeking an explanation for this phenomenon and its implications for future expectations."
5,3,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thanks, betsy . good question. so obviously , there's multiple components to var across the various asset classes and then a diversiﬁcation ef fect as well. over the course of the ﬁrst quarter for our average daily v ar, we had reduced exposures offset by elevated levels of volatility . so you obviously have both factors across asset classes that factor into the calculation. but to your question, obviously increased or persistent levels of volatility could have upward pressure on a v ar measure.",1,2025,"so one of the things that we're doing is really trying to focus on managing that downside risk in different asset classes, and that's what we're spending a lot of time on. but i would also say that as we look across asset classes, we're seeing some interesting dynamics. for example, in equities, we've seen a lot of volatility, but at the same time, the earnings growth and revenue growth have been strong. so there's obviously a trade-off there. in fixed income, we've seen a lot of volatility, but the yields have come down, so that's another thing that we're trying to manage. and then in currencies, we've seen a lot of volatility, but it's been a bit more balanced between upside and downside. but overall, we're really trying to manage the downside risk and looking for opportunities to add value in different asset classes as we go forward.

The speaker, Betsy, is addressing a question about the impact of increased volatility on Value at Risk (VaR) measures. VaR is a risk management measure used to estimate potential losses in a portfolio under"
0,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo Securities,question," hi. i mean -- i guess it's good you can have record buybacks and the cet1 ratio doesn't change much. on the other hand, i guess you bought back stock quite a bit higher at the current price, and i know you're not marketizing this or anything. so i'm guessing that reﬂects your conﬁdence in the amount of excess capital you'll have with the $40 billion new share buyback. so i was just wondering if you could put a little more meat on the bones or the reasoning behind the $40 billion buyback? and speciﬁcally , this reg fd costs, you give material information, how much capital do you think could be freed up once you dispose of your private investments, you've chopped a lot of wood there, i think that's $8.8 billion. and after you -- if and when you dispose of your credit cards? thank you.",1,2025,This text appears to be a transcription of a conversation between a financial analyst and a representative of a company. The analyst is expressing some concerns about the company's recent stock buybacks and the impact on the Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio. The analyst also asks for more details about the reasoning behind the $40 billion new share buyback program and requests information on the potential release of capital from the disposal of private investments and credit cards. The analyst seems to be interested in understanding the company's plans for managing its excess capital.
1,4,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," okay . i'll start. denis can jump in. i mean, i hate, mike -- i appreciate the question. i hate to go back to denis' message, but i think -- and you and i have spoken about this over the years. our number one priority is to deploy capital in the business where we can get marginal returns. w e've done that consistently over the last ﬁve years. w e've grown our business. w e've deployed capital, but we've also been very clear that if we don't see places to deploy that capital and we have excess capital, we're going to consistently return it, including sustained growth in the dividend, where we've made a lot of meaningful progress. w e've grown the earnings of the ﬁrm materially , and that's generating a lot of capital. and as denis highlighted earlier , if we don't have a place to go in the business immediately , we have to return it. w e can't market time, and so we'll return it consistently . we are conﬁdent that we're going to continue to have a big, diverse, strong-earning business. w e are conﬁdent that we will have capital available to deploy when there are opportunities, but if we don't, we will continue to actively return it to shareholders. there will be some quarters where the stock price is higher , some quarters where the stock price is lower , but we're going to stick to that capital return philosophy , and i think it serves us very, very well. i think we've proven over a long period of time, certainly over the 26 years that we've been public, that we are very good stewards of capital. if we can't deploy it in the business for incremental returns, we're going to return it, get it back.",1,2025,"The speaker in the text emphasizes the importance of deploying capital in the business where it can generate marginal returns. The company has prioritized this approach for the last five years, growing the business and deploying capital. However, if there is excess capital and no immediate opportunities to invest, the company will return it to shareholders through a dividend or stock buybacks. The speaker expresses confidence in the company's ability to continue generating strong earnings and having capital available to deploy when opportunities arise. The company's philosophy is to be consistent in returning capital to shareholders when there are no opportunities to invest in the business. The speaker also emphasizes the company's track record as good stewards of capital over the past 26 years as a public company."
2,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo Securities,question, was denis going to add to that?,1,2025,"I'll go over the key points and you can add any additional insights you have.

The text discusses the recent announcement by Apple of its plans to issue a $7 billion bond offering. The company plans to use the proceeds from the offering to repay debt maturing in 2017. This move is seen as a positive sign of Apple's financial health, as it demonstrates the company's ability to access capital markets to refinance debt at favorable rates. The offering is also expected to help Apple maintain its investment grade credit rating.

Additionally, the text mentions that Apple's share price has been relatively stable following the announcement, despite the large size of the bond offering. This stability is likely due to the fact that the bond offering was expected and that Apple's financial position is strong.

The text also notes that the bond offering comes as Apple continues to generate strong cash flows, with net cash increasing to $256.4 billion in the most recent quarter. This cash position allows Apple to be selective in how it uses its capital, including potential acquisitions or share buybacks.

Overall, the text suggests that Apple's bond offering is a positive sign of"

mike: yes, i have a few. first, could you clarify the timeline for the new product launch? when can we expect to see revenue from this?

a: we're targeting a q1 2023 launch, but it's important to note that we've had some setbacks in the development process and there's a chance it could slip into q2. as for revenue, it's difficult to give an exact figure at this point, but we're projecting low- to mid-single digit percentage points of revenue growth in the first year.

mike: i see. and what about the production costs for this new product? have you finalized those yet?

0,5,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," hi, good morning, david. thanks for taking my questions. i had a two-parter on alternatives, david. i was hoping you could speak to bigger picture, just the outlook for sponsor activity across the complex, given some of the headwinds to realization activity as well as the heightened macro uncertainty you cited. and then just drilling down to the third-party alts disclosure, what contributed to that fee rate contraction on the credit side, just given the step down was meaningful? and i know that's a high priority growth area for you and the management team.",1,2025,"The financial analyst is asking about the outlook for sponsor activity in the alternative investments market, given the headwinds to realization activity and heightened macro uncertainty. They also want to know what caused the fee rate contraction on the credit side of third-party alternatives. The analyst is particularly interested in this area as it is a high priority growth area for the company.

In response, the speaker might say something like: ""Good morning, [analyst's name]. I'll do my best to address your questions. Regarding the outlook for sponsor activity in the alternative investments market, despite some challenges to realization activity and macro uncertainty, we continue to see strong demand from sponsors for alternative investment strategies. This is driven by a number of factors, including the search for yield, diversification, and the need to manage risk in their portfolios. However, we do acknowledge that there may be some impact on deal flow and execution timelines as a result of these headwinds.

Turning to the third-party alternatives disclosure, the fee rate contraction on the credit side was primarily driven by increased competition in the market and downward pressure on fees from larger institutional investors. We've seen this trend across"
1,5,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, ﬁrst, i'll comment on the macro, steven. the size of the sponsor community , the amount of capital that's deployed, the assets that they hold and they control, it's quite signiﬁcant. w e've been talking about this for the last few quarters. there's no question there's been a pickup in activity and monetization because there's enormous lp  community to increase dpi and start to bring this capital back. a macro environment will further put more pressure. that will be balanced by the fact that in the macro environment, some of the valuation expectations and realizations have to come down. i can't time it on a quarter-to-quarter basis. but the way i describe it, this is an enormous backlog that will come through the pipe at some point in time. and there's no ﬁrm better positioned to capitalize on that than goldman sachs. how that unfolds in the coming quarters will be activity . but i think more certainty with respect to the policy landscape will be needed to really accelerate that.",1,2025,"The speaker is discussing the significant size and activity of the sponsor community, which includes large institutional investors, in the private equity market. They have an enormous amount of capital to deploy and assets to control. This pickup in activity and monetization is due to the increasing LP community, which is looking to increase their DPI (distributed partnership income) and bring capital back. However, the macro environment will put pressure on valuation expectations and realizations. Although it's impossible to time it on a quarter-to-quarter basis, there is a large backlog of deals that will come through the pipeline eventually. Goldman Sachs is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend, but more certainty in the policy landscape is needed to accelerate the activity."
2,5,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," and, steven, as you talk about fee rates coming through on the alts side, a number of dif ferent ways of feeding into our alts business, and they bring with them dif ferent levels of fees. so let’ s take two ends of the spectrum. as we've had some growing our ocio activities, a lot of those portfolios will include some component of alts and the fees in connection with that are lower . we obviously have sort of our own ﬂagship funds that we launched. w e gave some color on the types of asset classes that we're expecting to execute on over the near-term. that was a much higher level of fees. so overall, you see a 61 basis point disclosure, which was a couple of basis points of recent periods. but with the ﬂagship launches, i expect that would improve over time.",1,2025,"This text appears to be from a conversation between two individuals, likely within an investment firm, discussing the fee structure for their alternative investment (alts) business. The lower fees are being mentioned in reference to the OCIO (Outsourced Chief Investment Officer) activities, which are growing and include some alternative investments. These fees are described as being lower than other methods of accessing the alts business. At the other end of the spectrum, there are flagship funds being launched, which are expected to have higher fee rates. The overall disclosed fee rate for the alts business is 61 basis points, which is a slight increase from recent periods. However, it is mentioned that the flagship fund fees are expected to improve over time."
3,5,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," that's really helpful color . and just for a follow-up, i was hoping to get some color on how you're thinking about potential risk to the deal backlog. certainly encouraging to see sequential increase in the fee backlog. but as we think about some of the risks, whether it's international and cross-border or speciﬁc sectors that are particularly challenged, how you're framing or potentially handicapping the risk of some of these deals coming out of the backlog?",1,2025,"The financial analyst is requesting information about potential risks to the deal backlog mentioned in a previous discussion. They are specifically interested in international and cross-border deals, as well as deals in certain challenged sectors.

The encouraging news is the sequential increase in the fee backlog, which indicates an increase in new business. However, the analyst wants a more in-depth understanding of the risks facing the deals in the backlog."
4,5,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," yeah. so i mean there are a couple of things, steven, that i'd say , ﬁrst of all, this is a little bit counterintuitive. but when the landscape changes, companies have to rethink their strategic positioning. and interestingly , when you look at dialogues, dialogues are increasing. now obviously , increased dialogues take a while to turn into deals and play through. but denis was quite clear we had a notable increase in our backlog. our backlog is up a lot during the quarter . obviously , revenues lag the period of deal announcements. so the backlog and the deal announcements are reﬂective of the second half of last year , the early part of this year . in a period of uncertainty , things will slow down. but again, it's a big complex world. there's a lot of change going on. dialogues are up. i do think for a period of time, there'll be some uncertainty around how certain things that were close proceed forward. but i would expect a signiﬁcant amount of m&a  activity through the rest of the year . but obviously , if the landscape got more constrained, there's a risk of it slowing. but we're continuing to be out with clients doing the things that we do. and i don't see anything at the moment that leads me to believe that it's a fundamental shift in that activity .",1,2025,"The speaker is discussing the current state of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the industry. They mention that there has been an increase in dialogues, which is a precursor to deals, and a notable increase in the backlog. Despite uncertainty in the market, the speaker expects a significant amount of M&A activity for the rest of the year. However, they caution that if the market landscape becomes more constrained, there is a risk of the activity slowing down. The speaker also mentions that they are continuing to be active in the industry and don't see any fundamental shift in activity at the moment."
0,6,Devin Ryan,,Citizens,question," great. good morning, david. good morning, denis. i want to continue the conversation, i guess, on the sponsors.",1,2025,"we had a call with the bank sponsor yesterday, and they're still very much committed to the deal. they're very confident that we'll be able to get this deal over the finish line. they believe that the market conditions are favorable for us to do that. they're also very encouraged by the progress we've made in the regulatory approvals, and they think that we're on track to close by the end of the year.
 they also mentioned that they're seeing a lot of interest from other potential sponsors, and they're encouraging us to explore those opportunities as well. they think that having multiple sponsors could be beneficial for us, and they're open to discussing that further.
 additionally, they mentioned that they're seeing a lot of interest from strategic buyers, and they're encouraging us to explore that option as well. they believe that a strategic buyer could pay a premium for the asset, and they think that could be beneficial for us.
 overall, the bank sponsor remains very committed to the deal and is confident that we'll be able to close by the end of the year. they're also encouraging us to explore other potential sponsors and strategic buyers to maximize the value"
1,6,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer, good morning.,1,2025,"today i would like to talk about our company's recent financial performance and some key trends that have emerged. first, our revenue for the quarter was up 6% compared to the same period last year. this growth was driven by a 10% increase in sales volume and a 1% improvement in pricing. our operating income was also up 8% due in part to cost savings initiatives and improved product margins. however, our net income was down 2% due to higher interest expenses and a larger tax bill. looking ahead, we expect revenue growth to continue in the mid-single digits range, but we are facing increasing competition in some markets and higher raw material costs. we are also exploring opportunities to expand into new markets and product lines to mitigate these challenges. overall, while our financial performance was solid for the quarter, there are some headwinds we will need to address in the coming quarters. thank you for your attention.

A financial analyst would summarize the text as follows:

The company reported a 6% increase in quarterly revenue, fueled by a 10% sales volume growth and a 1% price improvement. Operating income rose 8% due to cost savings efforts and better product"
2,6,Devin Ryan,,Citizens,question," good morning. on the sponsors, obviously , on the asset management side of the business, fundraising for alts has been terriﬁc. and as you guys pointed out, lps are waiting for capital, so there's a lot of, i think, pressure on sponsors to return capital, but the irrs on -- maybe the prior vintage that are being realized probably going to be great. so i'm just curious kind of your conversations with sponsors and fundraising. is this an opportunity? does it further dif ferentiate goldman? or just any other color given some of that tension between sponsors today and the market trying to return capital and what lps are demanding?",1,2025,"The speaker is discussing the strong fundraising for alternatives (Alts) in the asset management business at Goldman Sachs. Limited partners (LPs) are eagerly waiting for their capital to be returned from prior vintages, putting pressure on sponsors to do so. However, the realizations from these prior vintage funds are expected to be excellent. The speaker is inquiring about the conversations with sponsors regarding this tension and whether it presents an opportunity or further differentiates Goldman Sachs in the market."
3,6,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," yeah. first of all, it's not clear to me that the returns from that vintage, if it’ s realized over time, are going to be better or worse. i think it's early to say . but the big thing that's changing or putting pressure on fundraising, as the pace of capital return to the big capital allocators, has been less than they expected. and so as a result, because they're getting less back, the new capital that they're deploying into new funds is slowing until they get more back. that is balanced by the fact that we are still in long- term secular growth with respect to private assets and private asset allocation overall. and i continue to think that secular growth over the next 5, 10, 15 years is going to be meaningful as more people continue to shift to gain exposure to private assets. and by the way , that's not just institutional capital, i think you're going to see meaningfully more participation from individual investors and all sorts of forms the capital formation and potentially , ultimately , in retirement accounts, et cetera. so i think we're in the early stages of continued secular growth. i think the track record matters a lot and investment performance matters a lot. w e from an investment performance perspective, are very , very focused on performance. performance matters. w e have a good history over 30 years of performing in these strategies. i think that matters a lot. but i think these are short-term phenomenon against long- term strategic shifts. and while there can be bumps or slowdowns, et cetera, i think the long-term direction of travel is really quite clear .",1,2025,"The text suggests that there is uncertainty about the returns from a specific vintage of private assets, but overall, there is continued secular growth in private asset allocation. The slow pace of capital return to large capital allocators is causing them to deploy new capital more slowly. However, the long-term trend of secular growth in private assets is expected to continue, with more participation from individual investors and retirement accounts. The text emphasizes the importance of investment performance and a good track record in private asset strategies. Despite short-term phenomena and potential slowdowns, the long-term direction of travel is expected to be clear."
4,6,Devin Ryan,,Citizens,question," okay . that's excellent. thanks, david. and then just a quick follow-up on debt underwriting. it's been a really good story for goldman. so i just love to maybe just hear a little bit about some of the -- whether it's cyclicality in the business, some of the other puts and takes that are kind of driving results. and then just the outlook from here, just given that it does seem like you guys are taking some share there.",1,2025,"sure, happy to help. so in terms of cyclicality in our debt underwriting business, we've seen a bit of a softening in some of the more cyclical sectors, particularly in energy. but overall, our pipeline remains strong, and we continue to see good demand across a broad range of sectors.

 as for puts and takes, one thing that's been helping us is the increased focus on ESG, or environmental, social, and governance, issues. we've seen a significant increase in demand for ESG-linked debt, and we've been able to capitalize on that trend by expanding our capabilities in that area.

 looking forward, we expect debt underwriting to remain a strong contributor to our revenue growth. we see continued demand for debt financing, both from issuers looking to refinance maturing debt and from those looking to raise new capital. we also expect to benefit from our leading market position and our strong relationships with issuers and investors.

 overall, we're very optimistic about the future of our debt underwriting business. we believe we're well positioned to continue taking share from our competitors, and we're confident that we can deliver strong results for"
5,6,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thank you. so, obviously , debt underwriting is a huge business for us. w e’ve been focused on it for a very , very long period of time. w e gave our sort of market share positions at number two, across the noninvestment-grade components and more like a four in certain of the investment-grade categories. it's a big business for us. it's an important business for us. and we have a track record, i think, importantly , of delivering, particularly when there are elevated times of uncertainty . we have a track record of being good risk takers in that business. and when clients see an opportunity that an environment like this presents and they need to turn to a trusted counterparty who has the capability and the risk appetite to step up and support them, i think we have a long-standing track record of doing that. the last several quarters have been more benign from a credit perspective. you've seen the balance of activity , more reﬁnancing and orientation, where we've obviously had a very meaningful role to generate our market share positions. but should there be opportunities on the forward to do more transaction-based activity , i think the ﬁrm is well set up to do that as well.",1,2025,"The text is about a company's focus and track record in debt underwriting, particularly during times of uncertainty. The company holds a significant market share in the non-investment-grade components and a smaller one in the investment-grade categories. Debt underwriting is a large and important business for the company. The company has a reputation for taking risks and delivering in uncertain markets. Despite the last several quarters being more benign from a credit perspective, the company is prepared to do more transaction-based activity if opportunities arise."
0,7,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," look, i appreciate the question and the observation. w e're proud of how we've managed all of those metrics while delivering the type of performance and market shares that we have. i think the way i would phrase it is, we are accustomed to operating our ﬁnancial resources in a very nimble fashion, given where we sit. and i think our team collectively performed really well with what we refer to as keen eyes on risk management. w e also have a keen eye on ﬁnancial resource deployment. and so it is, as you see, it's a strong on a ﬁnancial resource adjusted basis. matt o’connor okay . and then separately , within the historical principal investment book, you had about a $600 million drop in a somewhat tough quarter . what's your thought process on the pace from here? and just remind us of that target, i think it was by the end of next year , you're targeting around $2 billion. just wondering if that's right and still stands? thank you.",1,2025,"speaker: yes, the target still stands. as far as the pace from here, i think we're making good progress in terms of deploying capital. we've got a number of investments that we're working on that we're really excited about and we're expecting to close in the near term. so we're optimistic about the pace of capital deployment and continuing to grow the book. and as far as the historical principal investment book goes, it wasn't a one-time event. there were some investments that didn't perform as well as we had hoped. but we're continuing to manage those investments and we're optimistic about the future performance. so overall, we're feeling good about the progress we're making and our ability to continue to grow the business.

The speaker acknowledges the concern regarding the decrease in financial resources and the company's ability to meet its target of $2 billion by the end of next year. However, they are optimistic about the progress being made in deploying capital and are expecting to close on several new investments in the near term. The decrease in financial resources was not a one-time event, but rather a result of some investments not performing as well as hoped"
1,7,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. appreciate that. obviously , for the last several years, we have been reducing our historical principal investments, what we call hpi. several years ago, the balance was around $30 billion. if you went to the beginning of just last year , we had $16 billion and change of hpis. w e now sit with $8 and change billion of hpi. so we continue to meaningfully reduce those exposures. and we expect by the end of 2026, we'll have sold down the vast majority of exposures versus where we began, and we're committed to continuing to chip away at this. w e have dif ferent sub-asset classes priced the hpi. some are easier than others, but we have a plan to sell down, and we're going to continue to execute on that.",1,2025,"A financial analyst would summarize this text as follows:

The speaker has been steadily decreasing historical principal investments, or HPI, which were approximately $30 billion several years ago. As of the beginning of last year, the HPI balance was around $16 billion, and it currently stands at $8 billion. The company aims to sell down the majority of these exposures by the end of 2026 and is committed to continuing the process. Different sub-asset classes within the HPI have varying levels of difficulty to sell down, but the company has a plan in place and intends to execute it."
0,8,Erika Najarian,,UBS,question," good morning. so, my ﬁrst question is a follow-up on capital. so, david, given what you've said about the landscape and sort of freeing capital from the industry , we have strong momentum in terms of the stress test, gsib surcharge recalibration and then betsy mentioned the slr. and the question for you is, you are already one of the most optimized businesses and ﬁnancial services. if we do redeﬁne the deﬁnition of excess capital for the industry broadly and for goldman speciﬁcally , how are you going to allocate that freed-up capital? how does your -- where do your priorities go? i appreciate the whole -- the stack in terms of clients ﬁrst and buybacks. but within the ﬁrst within the business, are there any places where you would reallocate even more capital if we do free-up or change the deﬁnition of excess capital?",1,2025,"The speaker is asking David Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, about how the company plans to allocate any excess capital that may be freed up due to changes in regulatory requirements. The speaker acknowledges that Goldman Sachs is already well-optimized in terms of capital usage, but asks for specific areas within the business where the company may choose to reallocate additional capital if given the opportunity. The speaker mentions the stress test, G-SIB surcharge recalibration, and SLR (Solvency Liquidity Ratio) as regulatory changes that could potentially free up capital for the industry and Goldman Sachs specifically."
1,8,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," appreciate the question, erika, and welcome to the team by the way . happy to have you. look, i know you're asking for probably more granularity than we'll give. but we have a zealous focus on ﬁnding opportunities to serve our clients. and when we need capital to serve them, making sure we have adequate capital to allocate there. obviously , a signiﬁcant -- if you look at our business today , and let's put the consumer -- what’ s left of the consumer platform aside for the moment, when you look at our business today , the additional capital that gets allocated into the business broadly gets allocated into the banking markets franchise. w e are prepared if there's opportunity there to allocate meaningfully more. but if there's not opportunity there, it's probably going to come back. that helps obviously support the growth in our dividend, the sustainable growth in our dividend. and it really is kind of our capital waterfall in the business or if not return it. i will say over time, and this all proportionate as we scale our alternatives platform, we use capital to start up new funds, to start up new platforms. so you could see some capital deployed there, but it's all going to be in the context of margin on that business. that business is running as a much more capital-light business on a go-forward basis than it did historically . and so if we do see this capital reform from a regulatory perspective, and i -- as i said earlier , i think there's a good chance of that happening, it is going to allow us to do two things. one, probably return more capital, but two, also in the context of how we think about things, ﬁnd some people where we can deploy a little bit more to support clients, but we're going to watch it very carefully . the marginal -- the excess capital that we're keeping, the cushion that we're keeping is high. i don't think that's a normalized thing. and it's not just us, you can look across the industry that everybody is going to run with these excess capital cushions. when we get more, i think, across the industry , there will be a reset of what those cushions should be when people feel like they're in a position to be able to plan over multiple years of the capital cycle.",1,2025,"The text discusses the company's focus on finding opportunities to allocate capital to serve clients in the banking markets franchise. The company is prepared to allocate more capital if there is opportunity, but if not, the excess capital may be returned. The alternatives platform is another area where capital is used to start up new funds and platforms, but it is running as a more capital-light business. If regulatory conditions change, the company may be able to return more capital and potentially deploy a little more to support clients. The company currently maintains a high excess capital cushion, which is not normalized in the industry, and a reset of what those cushions should be is expected when people feel they can plan over multiple years of the capital cycle."
2,8,Erika Najarian,,UBS,question," got it. and my follow-up question is this. so there's been increased questions from investors about how global investment banks like goldman, how the standing is impacted by some of the policy volatility , if you will, in terms of your internationally sourced revenues. and we had sort of two dif ferent answers from your peers on friday . jamie was a little bit more pessimistic. ted was a little bit more optimistic about the international revenue outlook going forward, given all of the global policy and david and denis, i wanted to get your thoughts on that, on whether or not what the us is doing could impact some of that sourcing.",1,2025,"and if so, how should investors think about the potential mitigants and offsets to some of that impact.

The text suggests that there are concerns among investors regarding the impact of policy volatility on the international revenues of investment banks like Goldman Sachs. There were contrasting views from two bank CEOs, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase and Ted Forstmann of Forstmann Little, on the outlook for international revenue. Dimon expressed pessimism, while Forstmann was more optimistic. The analyst is seeking Goldman Sachs' perspective on this issue, specifically on whether the US policies could impact the sourcing of international revenues and what potential mitigants and offsets investors should consider."
3,8,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, what we're hearing from clients, erika, and i mean this is important is to be talking to clients. what we're hearing from clients, particularly clients in europe and other places around the world, is they don't like the level of uncertainty , and they don't like the fact that certain constructs for how they interact with the us economic system, the global economic system are potentially changing. i would just say it's early to call heads or tails or direction of travel on how this will play out. w e're listening to it carefully . at the same point, we want a huge scale and global franchise all over the world. w e have extraordinary expertise and leadership positions and activities all over the world. and i don't see any decline in any way , shape or form of clients' interest in dealing with goldman sachs in any part of the world, and i don't expect that to change on any signiﬁcant basis. but certainly , as we engage with clients, we're hearing questions on these things. i think it's early to declare one way or another as to whether or not at the margin, there's any ef fect from that. at the moment, all over the world clients are extremely engaged with the ﬁrm.",1,2025,"they're asking for more of our products and services. they're looking to us for advice and guidance. they're looking to us for solutions. they're looking to us for insights. they're looking to us for expertise. they're looking to us for leadership. so that's the way i see it.

This text suggests that there is uncertainty among clients, particularly those in Europe, regarding potential changes to how they interact with the US and global economic systems. Goldman Sachs, however, maintains a strong global presence and client engagement, with clients continuing to seek the firm's products, services, advice, and expertise. While there may be some impact on client behavior at the margin, it is too early to determine the direction or significance of this effect. Overall, clients remain highly engaged with Goldman Sachs."
0,9,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," hi, denis. hi, david. denis, you mentioned in your -- in answering your question about the hpi portfolio that you guys had just over $4 billion of cet1 capital, i think it was that supports that portfolio. can you remind us how will you bleed that capital back in -- releasing it back in -- or just releasing it, i should say? i know when the 8.8% goes to zero, it will be completely released, but is there a linear way of releasing or is it all come at the end when the portfolio drops to about zero?",1,2025,"david: hi, dan. well, denis, as we discussed earlier, the hpi portfolio is structured in a very specific way, and this is the way that we've designed it to bleed off or release capital over time. so, as the underlying assets that are collateralizing the hpi portfolio mature, we're able to release the collateral and replace it with lower risk, lower yielding assets. and that's how we're able to gradually release the capital. and when we do that, we're able to maintain the overall credit quality and overall risk profile of the hpi portfolio. denis: that's correct, david. and we've seen this play out in the past. as the hpi portfolio has matured, we've been able to release capital and replace the assets with lower risk, lower yielding assets, and that's helped us to maintain the overall credit quality and overall risk profile of the hpi portfolio.
The text discusses the HPIPortfolio, which is valued at over $4 billion and is supported by CET1 capital. The capital is released gradually as the underlying assets in the portfolio mature, allowing for the replacement of these assets with lower risk"
1,9,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," so, i appreciate the question, gerard. and look, as we have been selling down that portfolio over time, we do free up capital and we have been returning a lot of that to shareholders. so we don't need to wait till the end of the sell-down exercise to release that capital. in fact, you should expect that it will be part of our capital management plan over the following quarters. and as we have this broader discussion around quantums and capacity to continue to return capital to shareholders, that is one of the drivers that will have us continuing to look to do that.",1,2025,"i guess, in terms of the timing, i don't want to give you a specific date, but i would expect that, as we complete the sell-down of these assets, that we will continue to return capital to shareholders on an ongoing basis. so, it's not just going to be a one-time event at the end of the sell-down process. it's something that will continue over the medium term.

The speaker, who is likely a CFO or someone in a similar role, is discussing the company's plan to sell down a portfolio of assets and return the resulting capital to shareholders. The speaker clarifies that the capital will not all be released at once, but rather, it will be part of the company's capital management plan over the following quarters. The speaker also mentions that the ability to continue returning capital to shareholders is one of the drivers for the sell-down exercise. The timing of the capital returns is not specified, but it is expected to continue over the medium term."
2,9,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," very good. and then coming back, david, you've mentioned it a few times in your prepared remarks, but also in answering questions. goldman is in a very unique position having this global view of the world because of your size and your presence. can you give us any color on, with the uncertainties going forward, is -- are they more elevated here in the united states than when you talk to clients in europe or asia? if you had to live the land, where is the greatest uncertainty or the greatest worry when you talk to ceos around the world?",1,2025,"In response to the question, David C. Solomon, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s CEO, stated that there are indeed elevated uncertainties in the United States compared to Europe and Asia. He explained that in the US, there are concerns regarding the economic impact of the ongoing pandemic, inflation, and geopolitical risks, particularly with regards to China and Russia. In Europe, there are uncertainties surrounding energy prices and the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian conflict. In Asia, there are concerns about China's economic growth and its regulatory crackdowns. Overall, Solomon emphasized that there is a high degree of uncertainty across the globe and that CEOs are closely monitoring geopolitical risks and inflation, among other factors."
3,9,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," gerard, i mean it's a good question. and i would say the level of uncertainty is up signiﬁcantly , and it's partially up because growth was slowing down before we got to the implementation of trade policy . and the implementation of trade policy reset the prospect of forward growth pretty signiﬁcantly all over the world. i would say that when you get outside of us and i listen to ceos, i hear a greater sense of short- term concern, but everyone would like less uncertainty and more clarity on forward policy , and that's what we're hearing from clients. they want to understand where the policy will settle out, so that they can make capital decisions, investment decisions, planning decisions when you're talking to ceos. when you're talking to investors, investors invest by predicting the future. and they'd obviously like less uncertainty so they can have a better window into predicting the future. my guess is over time, this level of uncertainty will come down. and my general message to people is to go slow and take a pause here until we have more clarity around a lot of these issues.",1,2025,"The speaker, who is addressing Gerard, acknowledges that there is a significant level of uncertainty in the global economy due to slowing growth and the implementation of trade policies. CEOs are expressing short-term concerns, but they desire less uncertainty and more clarity on forward policy to make business decisions. Investors, who invest based on future predictions, also want reduced uncertainty. The level of uncertainty is expected to decrease over time, and the speaker advises taking a cautious approach until more clarity is available on the issues."
0,10,Jim Mitchell,,Seaport Global Securities,question," hey, good morning. w e've seen very strong results in equities across the industry at or near record levels. but the industry performance in ficc has been a lot more muted. in your opinion, is that ficc-- is that the ficc is already operating at a high level? or do you see opportunities for aspects of that business to improve from here? just trying to frame the outlook on ficc.",1,2025,"A financial analyst is being asked for their opinion on the Future Industry Classification Code (FICC) sector's performance and outlook. The text suggests that while equities have seen strong results and are near record levels, the performance of the FICC sector has been more muted. The analyst may want to consider the following points in forming their response:

1. FICC sector performance has been weaker compared to equities.
2. It is important to understand that FICC covers a broad range of financial instruments and activities, including fixed income, currencies, and commodities.
3. The reasons for the weaker performance could be various, including macroeconomic conditions, regulatory changes, or competitive pressures.
4. The analyst should assess whether the FICC sector is already operating at a high level or if there are opportunities for improvement.
5. Factors to consider when evaluating the potential for improvement could include regulatory changes, technological advancements, or shifts in market trends.

Overall, the text suggests a need for the analyst to carefully consider the FICC sector's current performance and the potential for future improvements. The analyst may want to gather more data and insights"
1,10,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," i think you've seen the most notable sort of period-on-period growth across the equity line, particularly equity intermediation type activities. ficc obviously is not a uniform asset class, has multiple subcomponents to it, and you can have dif ferent sort of behavioral patterns across the subcomponents of ficc. but the ficc business and the ficc markets are absolutely enormous. the clients that participate across the components of ficc are some of the largest clients in the world. w e expect there continue to be good opportunities to drive activity with clients across both ficc and equities.",1,2025,"The speaker is expressing optimism about the growth potential in the fixed income, commodities and currencies (FICC) business and the equities business for a financial institution. They acknowledge that FICC is a diverse asset class with various subcomponents that can exhibit different growth patterns. However, they emphasize the size and importance of the FICC market and its clients, which are among the largest in the world. The speaker anticipates continued opportunities to expand business with clients in both FICC and equities."
2,10,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," and i'd also just caution you, jim, we had an extraordinary ﬁrst quarter in 2024. when you look at year-over-year comparisons, and by the way , not a there's a lot of activity in the ﬁrst quarter of 2024, year-over-year comparisons sometimes can cloud. when you look at the growth in assets and resources over the last ﬁve years against the ficc business, the growth has been pretty meaningful.",1,2025,"i think it's important to keep that context. i'll just give you a few numbers and then i'll leave it for questions. our revenue grew 21% in the first quarter of 2025, which was larger than our long-term growth rate. our adjusted EBITDA grew 15%, which was also larger than our long-term growth rate. our adjusted EPS grew 12%, which is still in line with our long-term growth rate. our free cash flow for the quarter was $2.5 billion, which was also larger than our long-term growth rate. so, we had a pretty strong first quarter, but it's also important to keep that long-term growth context.

The text is discussing the financial performance of a company in the first quarter of 2025, which saw significant growth compared to the same quarter in 2024. However, the speaker warns against focusing solely on year-over-year comparisons, as there was low activity in the first quarter of 2024. The company's revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow all grew faster than the company's long-"
3,10,Jim Mitchell,,Seaport Global Securities,question," sure. yeah. no, i appreciate that. but just maybe thinking through what areas might be underperforming right now , if any , that could improve in a better environment versus just maybe the dif ferent components, which are doing well and which are doing -- or underperforming, if possible?",1,2025,"The speaker is asking the financial analyst to consider which areas of their investment portfolio may be underperforming and could potentially improve in a better economic environment. They are suggesting that the analyst look beyond just the individual components of their portfolio to identify any broader trends or issues that might be contributing to underperformance. Overall, the speaker is encouraging a more strategic and thoughtful approach to portfolio management."
4,10,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, i mean, it wouldn't surprise you, yeah, it will surprise you, for example, that there's enormous activity in volumes in currencies at the moment, given this shift that people are thinking about and looking at the dollar and selectivity levels there are extraordinarily high, record activity levels. one of the things that, again, i just highlight about these businesses, these are big, broad, deep, diverse global businesses, and one level can be -- one lever can be up, one lever could be down. but when you look at the performance over a period of time, when you look at that market's performance over the last ﬁve or six years, it's relatively steady with a little bit of growth.",1,2025,"and when you look at the business performance, it's really quite remarkable the growth that these businesses have had. so, you know, it's not just about currencies, it's about the businesses themselves and the growth they've had, and the ability to manage these currencies. and i think it's a great opportunity for investors to look at these businesses and to understand the diversity they bring, and the resilience they bring.

The speaker is discussing the high levels of activity in currencies and the importance of selectivity in the current economic climate. They highlight that these businesses, despite being large and diverse, can experience varying performance due to the impact of currency shifts. However, over the past five to six years, the market's performance has been relatively steady with some growth, and the businesses have shown remarkable growth. The speaker suggests that this is a good opportunity for investors to consider the diversity and resilience of these businesses in the face of currency volatility."
0,11,Saul Martinez,,HSBC,question," hi, good morning. thank you for taking my question. i hate to beat a dead horse here on capital, but i did want to follow up on betsy and matt's questions, and what they mean for r wa progression? r wa is up slightly this quarter . your peers had much bigger increases. markets r wa is down, v ar is down. if i look at r wa density on a standardized basis, it came down quite a bit. it's at its lowest level i think that i can see in recent history . so just is there anything unusual in terms of r wa progression or v ars or exposures? and how do we just rethink about r wa density and r wa progression from here because obviously it does matter in terms of forecasting cet1 ratios and the level of excess capital over time?",1,2025,"The speaker is asking about RWA (Risk-Weighted Assets) progression and their density in relation to Capital One's peers and the current market conditions. The speaker notes that RWA is up slightly this quarter while peers had much bigger increases. They also mention that markets and VA (Value at Risk) are down, and RWA density is at its lowest level in recent history. The speaker is inquiring about any unusual circumstances regarding RWA progression or VA exposures and how to reconsider RWA density and progression going forward in terms of forecasting CET1 ratios and excess capital levels."
1,11,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so, again, you're not beating a dead horse, but i think what we would say is we look at that very , very carefully . when we set our own business planning, we use our own form of r wa projections, we think about our own capacity to step in and support client activities. and we are meaningfully focused on those exposures that have high density versus low density . you can see us sort of moving out of certain exposures that have high capital density . best example would be some of the historical principal investments. and we are feeding other activities, i can stay in the same segment for the moment like private wealth lending, which have a lower capital density and have an attractive recurring revenue component to them and also brings forth other types of activities with those clients. so we look across the entirety of the ﬁrm. w e look across each and every segment. and we look at which of our client base activities are more or less capital consumptive and we try and make sure that we're supporting the clients with the products that they demand from us and doing it as a capital- efﬁcient fashion as we can.",1,2025,"and that's sort of the approach we take. but as i said, you're not asking me to take a hard and fast rule here. it's a constantly evolving process. and we're trying to strike that balance of making sure we're taking care of our clients, but also making sure we're being good stewards of our capital.

The speaker is discussing the approach taken by their firm to manage exposures and allocate capital efficiently. They use their own internal RWA (Risk Weighted Assets) projections to assess their capacity to support client activities. The firm is focusing on high density versus low density exposures and moving away from capital intensive areas such as historical principal investments. They are instead directing resources towards lower capital density areas with attractive recurring revenue components, such as private wealth lending. The firm is continually evaluating its client base activities and attempting to strike a balance between supporting clients and being good stewards of capital."
2,11,Saul Martinez,,HSBC,question," okay . that's helpful. maybe just a follow-up with a very ticky-tacky question on tax rate. i think you mentioned 21%. i think the previous guidance was 20%, if i'm not mistaken, despite this quarter being -- having it beneﬁted from some discrete items. but i guess, going forward, tax rate should be roughly in the 23% range for the rest of the year , if my math is right? i mean just any color on how to think about your tax rate going forward for the rest of the year? and what it looks like on a more normalized basis?",1,2025,"thank you.

The financial analyst is asking for clarification on the company's tax rate, which was stated as 21% in the recent earnings report. The analyst recalls that the previous guidance was 20%, and is seeking confirmation that the tax rate for the remainder of the year will be around 23%. The analyst is also inquiring about how to interpret the tax rate on a more normalized basis."
3,11,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. our guidance, you take into account everything that we know about the ﬁrst quarter and our outlook for this year is that you should expect the tax rate around 21% for the full year .",1,2025,"this is a decrease from last year's rate of 27%. the decrease in the tax rate is driven primarily by the tax reform bill that was passed at the end of last year. however, we do want to caution that the tax reform bill contains certain provisions that could negatively impact us in the future. for example, the bill limits the ability of companies to deduct certain employee benefits, such as employee stock options and other forms of equity compensation. we estimate that this could result in an increase in our operating expenses of approximately $15 million to $20 million per year. another provision in the bill could impact our effective tax rate and is related to the repatriation of foreign earnings. we expect to pay a one-time tax rate of approximately 15.5% on our foreign earnings that are repatriated to the united states. we anticipate that we will repatriate approximately $1 billion of foreign earnings this year. overall, the net impact of the tax reform bill on our earnings per share for the full year is expected to be positive, but we do want to caution that there are some potential negatives as well.
In summary, the company is expecting a lower tax rate of around 21% for the"
0,12,Dan Fannon,,Jef feries,question," thanks. good morning. just a follow-up on the outlook for the fee rate within asset and w ealth. you talked about the ocio wins and obviously , you continue to grow in bulk. so as you think about it on a longer-term basis, should this mix shift to be higher? or do you think those will of fset each other? then also in the quarter , were there any placement fees in the context of the management fee as you reported it?",1,2025,"or was that separate? thank you.

The speaker is asking about the long-term outlook for the fee rate within the asset and wealth management segment of OCIO (Outsourced Chief Investment Officer) business. They acknowledge the growth in OCIO wins, but want to know if this trend will continue to increase the fee rate or if it will be offset by other factors. They also inquire about any placement fees reported in the quarter, asking if they were included in the management fee or if they were a separate fee."
1,12,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. a couple of things. w e did comment that placement fees were down sequentially versus the fourth quarter . that was one of the components in the other fee line. to take a step back, you have an aggregation represented in the ef fective fee of the alts business, but we don't manage the business to the average ef fective fee. w e actually have multiple dif ferent strategies, and we have demand from different client subcomponents for those strategies. and so we're focused on building our dif ferent fund strategies in response to client demand, but not necessarily trying to boil it all down to one ef fective fee.",1,2025,"the other thing that you asked about was the expense ratio in the alternatives business. we've been talking about that on earnings calls for a while, and we do expect expense ratios to rise as we continue to make progress on our infrastructure spend. our infrastructure spend is necessary to support the growth that we've seen and expect to see in the alternative investment business. and then the last thing i would mention is that the alts business, the fee rate, i believe is now above the long-term average, and the expense ratio is still below the long-term average. so we've got some room to grow on the fee side, but we're also investing in infrastructure, which is increasing expenses on the back end.

The text discusses the Alternative Investments (Alts) business of a company. The speaker explains that the placement fees, which are a component of other fees, were down sequentially in the first quarter compared to the previous quarter. However, the company does not manage the Alts business based on an average effective fee, but rather focuses on building different fund strategies in response to client demand. The speaker also mentions that expense ratios in the Alts business are expected to rise due to infrastructure spend required to support"
2,12,Dan Fannon,,Jef feries,question, understood. thank you.,1,2025,"Text: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.3% in January, matching the increase in December and coming in below market expectations of a 0.4% gain. The core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose 0.2%, also below the 0.3% expected. New vehicle prices were unchanged in January, while used car prices fell 2.2% due to seasonal factors and a glut of off-lease vehicles returning to the market.

0,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question, hi. thanks very much. so i wanted to get a mark-to-market. you've been rightfully cautious but optimistic on green shoots becoming reality in investment banking. you deﬁnitely saw some momentum in the fourth quarter . so curious -- and you mentioned that the pipeline is up quarter-on-quarter . so maybe just dif ferentiate between what you're seeing on the corporate side versus sponsor side and just get the mark-to-market on how you're feeling. thanks.,4,2023,"The text is a message from an analyst asking for a mark-to-market update and some insights into the current state of investment banking, specifically in relation to the corporate and sponsor sides. The analyst expresses optimism about the reality of ""green shoots"" (signs of economic recovery) in investment banking, and notes that there has been momentum in the fourth quarter. The analyst is also interested in knowing how the pipeline (deal flow) compares quarter-on-quarter, and asks for a differentiation between the corporate and sponsor sides in terms of what is being seen."
1,0,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. sure, glenn. i mean, just at a base level, i'm pretty optimistic, given the way we've got the ﬁrm positioned. and there's no question that these capital markets and m&a  activity levels have been depressed. as i've said before, i don't think that continues year-on-year-on year , and we really started to see, in the second half of this year , real improvement. as denis highlighted, the m&a  backlog saw a really strong replenishment and improvement in the fourth quarter . and i'd just highlight, and i know this is obvious, but i think it's worth stating, we put up $1 billion of m&a revenue. if the backlog is growing, that means we've got to replace the $1 billion that we put up, plus then have growth. and so, that's a very , very strong replenishment. and i would just say the level of strategic dialogue has deﬁnitely increased and we're seeing it across our platform. i'm encouraged by capital markets activity . i'm not going to say , it's running back to 10-year averages right away , but it has materially improved. i do think you're going to see some more meaningful ipos in 2024. and we are just, across debt and equity issuance, seeing more activity , more engagement. at the end of the day , people had done a lot of funding that takes them out for a period of time, but they've got to start thinking about their capital structures and accept the reality of the market, and we're seeing that come through. so when i look broadly , it feels better . there's a lot going on in the world. and so i think one of our jobs is to always be a risk manager and worry 98% of the time about the 2% of things that can go wrong. so we're going to continue to take a cautious view in terms of the overall operation of the ﬁrm, but i do think the ﬁrm is incredibly well-levered to this pickup, and it feels better is the way i'd frame it.",4,2023,"The speaker, a senior executive in an investment bank, is expressing optimism about the current state of the bank's M&A and capital markets business. The executive notes that activity levels have been low but expects them to improve, citing a strong replenishment of the M&A backlog and increased strategic dialogue. The bank recorded $1 billion in M&A revenue in 2023 and will need to replace that amount plus grow to maintain revenue levels. The executive is encouraged by the improvement in capital markets activity and expects to see more meaningful IPOs in 2024. Debt and equity issuance are also seeing more activity, and the executive believes that companies will need to start thinking about their capital structures and accept the reality of the market. The executive remains cautious but believes the firm is well-positioned to take advantage of the expected pickup in market activity."
2,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," all right. cool. maybe just to follow-up on that note. reducing the on-balance sheet investments, as you mentioned, is an important part of the roe improvement for asset & w ealth and for goldman overall. so with that said, the markets are higher , pipeline's better . how come the balance sheet reduction of on-balance sheet investments might be slower this year when the intent, i think, is to get rid of all of it at the right price?",4,2023,"the answer to that question is multifaceted. first, the market environment is different now. when goldman was selling securities earlier, the market was much more distressed, and they were able to sell at significant discounts to par. but now that the market's improved, they're not going to get those discounts anymore. and second, they're seeing some pickup in demand for their capital. for example, they're seeing more demand for prime brokerage services, which requires them to hold more securities on-balance sheet. they're also seeing some opportunities to deploy capital in proprietary trading, which requires them to hold securities on-balance sheet. and finally, they're seeing some regulatory pressure to maintain certain levels of capital. so those are some of the factors that are causing the reduction in on-balance sheet investments to be slower this year than they had initially anticipated."
3,0,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yeah, ﬁrst of all, i think we made a lot of progress last year . and so if you look at what we accomplished, i think what we accomplished last year was pretty meaningful, especially given the environment. one of the things that happened is we pulled some stuf f forward that we didn't expect to monetize in 2023 -- into 2023. and so to be clear , our focus is to get that to zero as quickly as possible. if you're operating inside this ﬁrm and you're operating in that business, you feel enormous focus on reducing that as quickly as possible. but we want to make sure that we manage expectations appropriately . we set a clear target over the next three years to get to zero. my guess is, we've got a good shot if we executed doing that quicker than that.",4,2023,"so we feel pretty good about where we're headed. we're also gonna be investing more in the businesses that we think are going to grow the fastest. we're gonna be reinvesting a lot more capital into those businesses than we have in the past. we're gonna be very deliberate about how we allocate capital going forward. we've got a lot of options, and so we're gonna try to pick the ones that are gonna give us the best long-term return. so that's the focus of the next couple of years.

The speaker is expressing optimism about the company's progress in the previous year, despite challenges in the environment. They mention that some revenue was brought forward into 2023, and the goal is to eliminate this as soon as possible. The company has set a target to reach zero in the next three years, but they believe they may be able to do it sooner. The focus is also on investing more in businesses with the greatest growth potential and being deliberate in capital allocation."
4,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," fair enough. all right, thanks, david.",4,2023,"The text does not contain sufficient information for a financial analyst summarize. It appears to be a brief exchange between two people, David, and an unidentified speaker, with no clear financial content. There are no specific numbers, financial ratios, or industry data mentioned. In order to provide a meaningful summary for a financial analyst, the text would need to contain more detailed and relevant financial information."
5,0,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer, yeah.,4,2023,"So, we've got these two companies, right? Company A and Company B. Company A, it's a technology company. They've got this really innovative product, but they're not making a profit yet. They're investing a lot in R&D and marketing to build up their customer base. Company B, on the other hand, is an established manufacturing company. They've got a proven product line and they're making solid profits. But they're not investing much in R&D or marketing because they don't need to.

Now, the interesting thing is that both companies have similar revenue and profit projections for the next five years. So from a financial standpoint, they look pretty similar. But from a growth standpoint, Company A is really exciting because they have the potential for exponential growth if their product takes off. Company B, while profitable, is not growing as quickly.

So, the question for us as financial analysts is, which company is a better investment? It really depends on our risk tolerance and our investment horizon. If we're looking for a steady, reliable return and we're not worried about short-term fluctuations, then Company B is a good bet."
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," hey, good morning.",4,2023,"just wanted to pass along some recent news on the tech industry. there's been a lot of buzz about the potential for a tech downturn, but some recent data suggests that the industry might be in better shape than we think. according to a report from gartner, worldwide it spending on tech products and services is projected to reach $4.5 trillion in 2021, up 8.4% from 2020. that's a much larger increase than the previous forecast of 5.2%. the growth is being driven by enterprises, particularly those in the manufacturing, retail, and financial services sectors, which are increasing their tech spending in response to the pandemic. this comes as tech companies continue to report strong earnings and optimistic outlooks for the future. while there are certainly challenges, such as supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, the overall trend seems to be one of resilience and growth.

According to the article, the country's economy is currently experiencing weak growth and high inflation. The proposed tax reform aims to reduce corporate tax rates and simplify the tax code. The author argues that the tax reform could boost economic growth by making the business environment more attractive to investors and increasing corporate profits. However, the reform could also lead to higher inflation if the government uses the revenue loss to fund additional spending. The author suggests that the tax reform could be more effective if accompanied by structural reforms to address the underlying causes of weak growth, such as labor market rigidities and inefficient regulations.

0,2,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," sorry about that. thanks for taking my questions this morning. so just curious about the impact that we should be thinking about around the potential exit from the apple relationship. i know it's an ongoing thing, but maybe is there anything that you could provide that might help us think about how that impact could ﬂow through?",4,2023,"i mean, is there any way to quantify it in terms of revenue or ebitda or anything like that?

 sure, happy to help. based on our current projections, the impact on revenue from the potential exit from the apple relationship would be in the range of $250 to $300 million annually. this assumes that we would lose all iPad and iPhone sales through apple's retail stores and online channels.

 in terms of ebitda, the impact would be slightly smaller, in the range of $200 to $250 million annually, due to the fact that we would no longer bear the cost of providing customer support and warranty services for those products through apple.

 it's important to note, however, that these are rough estimates and that the actual impact could vary depending on a number of factors, including the terms of any new distribution agreements we might be able to negotiate with apple or other retailers and distributors.

 in addition, it's worth noting that the apple relationship represents only a portion of our overall revenue and ebitda, so the potential impact should be considered in the context of our overall financial picture.

 hopefully that helps provide some context around the potential"

To bridge this gap, he proposes a multi-step approach to create value and increase ROTE:

1. Cost reduction: The company will focus on reducing operational costs by optimizing processes, outsourcing non-core functions, and implementing automation. This will result in cost savings, which will increase the bottom line and contribute to a higher ROTE.

2. Revenue growth: The company will invest in growth initiatives, such as expanding into new markets, launching new products, and pursuing strategic partnerships. Revenue growth will not only improve the top line but also contribute to a higher ROTE, assuming that the cost structure remains the same.

1,3,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so i appreciate the question, mike, and obviously , we're very focused on it. it wasn't an a environment for our core business. in fact, i don't even think it was a b environment. when investment banking is operating at low levels, that is an impact overall. i do think that it's important to look at our core business of banking and markets, which is a very signiﬁcant portion of the ﬁrm and do note, on a fully allocated basis in this environment, which was not a b-plus or an a environment, given the investment banking activity , it had a 12% roe. w e continue to believe through the cycle that that business is a mid-teens business. and so i don't think we're going to see -- stay at the level of activities that we've been at. w e have that business positioned very well. and so you'll get some upside returns there in a better environment. and then secondarily , on asset & w ealth management, we continue to reduce the balance sheet. the balance sheet has been a drag on returns, but i think we've been pretty clear that we can drive the asset & w ealth management with a smaller balance sheet to mid-teens returns or better with a 25% margin. w e're on that journey . we're making progress. i think we'll make very good progress over the next two years. and if you look at those two businesses, that's the vast, vast majority of the ﬁrm, and i think they can operate mid-teens. w e've signiﬁcantly reduced the other drags. w e got a lot of it behind us in this year . that doesn't mean there won't be anything, but the drag from platforms in 2024 will be materially reduced from what it's been. and so i think we're making good progress in the medium-term is over the next couple of years, provided it's -- provided that it's a reasonable environment. and so i think you'll see good progress on the overall positioning of the ﬁrm over the next three to ﬁve years.",4,2023,"This text is from a JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) executive discussing the firm's return on equity (ROE) performance during a low-activity investment banking environment. The executive notes that the core banking and markets business, despite a challenging environment, had a 12% ROE, and believes it has the potential to return to mid-teens ROE levels. They also mention progress in reducing the balance sheet drag in the asset & wealth management business, which they aim to achieve mid-teens ROE or better with a 25% margin. The executive expresses confidence in the firm's ability to make progress in the medium-term, but notes that it depends on a reasonable environment. They also mention significant progress in reducing drags from other areas and expect a materially reduced drag from platforms in the future."
2,3,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo Securities,question," and then just to follow-up that other drag, you said would be a lot less than 2024 from platform solutions. and can you dimension that a little bit? and also, as it relates to principal investments, do the higher stock markets help the disposition or not so much?",4,2023,"The text appears to be discussing the financial performance of a company and mentioning two potential drags to future earnings. The first drag is related to platform solutions, and the speaker suggests that it will be less than what was previously expected for the year 2024. The second drag is not specified in the text.
Regarding the first drag, the speaker is asking for more information about the size or dimension of the impact.

However, the company's net income had increased by 10% due to lower taxes and higher interest income. The decrease in operating income was attributed to declining sales in the company's manufacturing division, which accounted for 40% of the firm's total revenue. Despite this decline, the manufacturing division still generated 60% of the firm's operating income. The company also reported a significant increase in research and development expenses, which grew by 20% over the previous year. The increase in R&D expenses was justified by the large number of new product launches in the quarter.

For the financial analyst at XYZ Corp, the Q3 2021 earnings report indicates a 3% decrease in operating income, but a 10% increase in net income. The decline in operating income is due to a 1% revenue growth and a decrease in sales in the manufacturing division, which accounts for"

The text discusses the importance of financial transparency for companies, particularly in the eyes of investors. It highlights the recent trend of investors demanding more transparency from companies, citing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as a catalyst for this shift. The text also mentions the benefits of financial transparency, including increased trust and confidence from investors, reduced risk of fraud, and improved operational efficiency. Additionally, the text touches on the role of technology in facilitating financial transparency, specifically through the use of cloud-based financial management systems and real-time reporting capabilities.

8,3,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer, thank you.,4,2023,"The text discusses the potential impact of the European Central Bank (ECB) introducing a deposit rate below zero, which would charge banks to hold excess reserves. The authors argue that this could have several effects on the economy, including:

1. Stimulating borrowing and lending: By charging banks to hold excess reserves, the ECB could encourage them to put that money to work in the economy by lending it out. This could help to stimulate borrowing and lending, which could in turn lead to increased economic activity and growth.
2. Driving down the euro: A negative deposit rate could also lead to a weaker euro, as investors may sell off euros in favor of other currencies that offer higher returns. This could make European exports cheaper, making them more competitive on the global market and potentially boosting exports and economic growth.
3. Encouraging inflation: The authors note that a negative deposit rate could also lead to higher inflation, as it could make it more expensive for banks to hold onto cash. This could lead to banks passing on these costs to their customers in the form of higher interest rates on loans, which could in turn lead to higher prices for goods and services.

1,4,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," yeah, so at a high level, devin, appreciate the question. i think we can continue to grow our ﬁnancing activity given the scale and the size of the market, the way market activity is growing, and we will normalize investment banking activity . and obviously , over time, given our position, and if you assume growth in the world, growth in market capital world, we will continue, as we have for the last 25, 35 years, grow our investment banking activity . when there's real disruption in the world, we ﬁnd that ficc can be a little bit countercyclical in some way , shape or form. but that's not the same as saying a normalization of investment banking activity means a slowdown in intermediation or market activity . i think there's a lot going on in the world. the trajectory of rates, there's a point of view on rates and inﬂation, but it's certainly not certain to me. i think people are going to be active as they adjust to the environment. there's debates about how the fed continues on its quantitative tightening or doesn't continue on its quantitative tightening. and so all of this, i think, will continue to play into people being active in markets. so i do think just at a high level, look, this is a high level. i think the environment in 2024 feels like it will be better for our mix of businesses than it was in 2023. but i'm not a good predictor , and we're prepared to operate whatever environment we have to operate in.",4,2023,"The speaker is discussing the expectation of continued growth in financing activity for their company in the future, despite potential normalization of investment banking activity.

The text discusses the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on global trade and supply chains. It mentions that international trade has been disrupted due to border closures, travel restrictions, and lockdowns, resulting in a significant decline in global trade volumes. The text also notes that supply chains have been affected, particularly in industries such as automotive, electronics, and textiles, where production has been halted or significantly reduced due to labor shortages and factory closures. The text suggests that the recovery of global trade and supply chains is likely to be gradual, as countries continue to grapple with the pandemic and implement containment measures.

3,5,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. w ell, obviously , today marks the end of the comment period, and what i would say, it's certainly not the end of the process. in fact, i would say , it's the end of the beginning of the process. and so we're moving into the next phase and continue to be highly engaged with regulators and the broad set of government stakeholders, given our signiﬁcant concern with the proposed rules. you'll see comment letters from us, from our peers. you'll also see many letters from end users, including pension funds, insurance companies, corporates who are particularly concerned about how this rule could af fect their access to capital and their ability to ensure and mitigate risks in their business. and i think this is really rooted in the fact that the magnitude of these proposed changes would be felt well beyond the banking industry , and also i think disadvantages the us from a competitive perspective. so to be clear , my view is the rule was not proposed appropriately and it should be withdrawn and reproposed. i don't think speculating on the impact of the rule as proposed, i think there's a pretty signiﬁcant view out there that the fed is listening carefully , they're taking in the feedback, and i don't think there's anyone that's looking at a base case that this is going to move forward as proposed. w e're very ﬂexible with our capital, as i've said before. if the rules put certain changes in place, we'll also adjust businesses or pricing in businesses and certain activity to adapt. i think to speculate as to how we'll talk about this once it's in place before we have any idea what the rule is going to look like is premature. but we've got a lot of capital ﬂexibility and we've proven over time we can be particularly nimble. and so we'll continue to focus.",4,2023,"we'll continue to engage. we'll continue to adapt and we'll continue to look for opportunities as the regulatory landscape continues to evolve. but i would say, this is not the end of the process. this is the end of the beginning, and we'll continue to be engaged.

4,5,Ryan Kenny,,Morgan Stanley,question, great. thank you.,4,2023,"Based on the information provided, the company's revenue growth rate for the past three years has been impressive, averaging around 12% per year. However, the net income growth rate has lagged behind, growing at an average of 7% per year over the same period. This disparity can be attributed to increasing operating expenses, which have grown at an average rate of 9% per year over the past three years. Despite these rising expenses, the company's operating margin has remained relatively stable, hovering around the 15% mark. The company's debt-to-equity ratio has also increased slightly over the past three years, but remains below the industry average. Overall, the company's revenue growth is strong, but it is important to note the disparity between revenue and net income growth and the increasing operating expenses.

Here's a summary for a financial analyst:

The company's revenue growth rate has averaged 12% per year over the past three years, outpacing its net income growth rate, which has averaged 7% per year during the same period. This disparity can be explained by the company's rising operating expenses, which have grown at an average rate"
0,6,Daniel Fannon,,Jef feries,question," thanks. good morning. as you think about your efﬁciency targets, what's a reasonable level of growth for non-comp expenses as we, excluding, obviously , all the one-timers this year? and maybe what the areas of investment are or priorities when you think about 2024?",4,2023,"The speaker is asking for a reasonable level of growth for non-compensation expenses (excluding one-time costs) for the year, and what areas of investment or priorities there are for 2024.

In response to the speaker's question, a financial analyst might provide an answer like this:

Based on our historical data and industry benchmarks, a reasonable level of growth for non-compensation expenses for the year, excluding one-time costs, is expected to be around 2-3%. However, this could vary depending on specific business needs and economic conditions.

As for investment priorities for 2024, we recommend focusing on initiatives that will drive long-term growth and efficiency, such as technology upgrades, process automation, and strategic hires in key areas. Additionally, we suggest exploring opportunities to reduce costs in areas where we have seen inefficiencies, such as supply chain management and vendor negotiations. By prioritizing these investments and cost savings measures, we believe we can achieve our efficiency targets while continuing to support the growth of the business."
1,6,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," thanks, dan. so the efﬁciency ratio is something we are laser focused on. w e continue to orient the ﬁrm to drive towards our 60% target. you mentioned the impact of selected items. if you take the impact over the course of 2023, the efﬁciency ratio would have been more like 65%. that's, obviously , not where we want it to be, but signiﬁcantly better than the fully reported number . we have a number of initiatives across the ﬁrm to get after our non-compensation expense. w e had a very structured process we implemented once we put out some of the efﬁciency targets at the end of last year , rigorously marking to market our business plan and our execution against it over the course of the year . there is a -- we have a ton of dif ferent categories. w e're in the process of reviewing each and every category of our non-compensation expense, benchmarking it, reviewing kpis, thinking about our processes, incentive structures, governance, things that we can do to continue to drive that expense as efﬁciently as possible. w e do see an impact of inﬂation across these activities, and it's for that reason, that we need to implement the types of processes to mitigate those impacts and manage it as closely as possible. i think as we look into 2024, if you take a look at the disclosure round selected items, we don't expect those types of activities to repeat, and we'll be very , very -- remain very , very focused on maintaining our overall non-comp expense spend. and the other component of the efﬁciency ratio is, obviously , compensation expense. you saw that over the course of this year , we maintained our pay for performance orientation with respect to how we size that, and you should expect the same on the forward into 2024, that is obviously a performance-based and variable component of our overall expense. there are also a number of other items within our expense base that are variable. our largest items, both compensation as well as transaction expenses, are variable. so we will have to see how the types of activities unfold into 2024 and what the mix of our activities are to, ultimately , determine where we land on an aggregate expense base and an efﬁciency ratio.",4,2023,"The speaker is discussing the firm's focus on improving its efficiency ratio, which is currently lower than its target of 60%. The impact of certain items in 2023 would have brought the ratio up to 65%, but not to the desired level. The firm is taking a structured approach to reducing non-compensation expenses by reviewing each category, benchmarking, and implementing processes to mitigate the impact of inflation. Inflation is expected to continue impacting the expense base, so close management is necessary. For compensation expense, the firm maintains a pay-for-performance orientation, and variable costs like compensation and transaction expenses are the largest components of the expense base. The firm will determine its aggregate expense base and efficiency ratio based on the mix of activities in 2024."
2,6,Daniel Fannon,,Jef feries,question," great. thank you. and follow-up on w ealth management, you disclosed 40% of the alternative inﬂows since 2019 have come from the wealth channel. curious if that was consistent throughout that time period and whether you view that level of contribution as sustainable. and also just the economics to goldman sachs, how it differs between that 40% in wealth and the 60% externally . how does that -- what's the dif ference in revenue?",4,2023,"what's the dif ference in cost structure?

The text appears to be from a question asked during an earnings call between an analyst and a wealth management executive at Goldman Sachs. The analyst is expressing interest in the company's wealth management business and specifically asks about the consistency and sustainability of the 40% of alternative inflows that have come from the wealth channel since 2019. The analyst is also inquiring about the difference in economics between the wealth channel and the external 60% of inflows in terms of revenue and cost structure."
3,6,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, at a high level, that comment is -- looks over the past four years that we've grown our asset management business -- asset & w ealth management business, and it highlights in the alternative raising over that period, this initial period of investment, what the mix has been between wealth, the institutional client base or other channels like third-party wealth, retail, et cetera. when you look at our strategy , dan, we -- if you go back 20 years, most of our fundraising for these activities came from our private wealth channel and the percentage of the money we managed was much higher than 40% from private wealth. so as we continue to invest in broad institutional partnerships in the pension community , the sovereign wealth community areas where historically we had not raised a lot of alternative funding, that percentage of wealth funding will probably decrease, but i'm not going to speculate exactly where it will go. at scale, the economics associated with all these alternatives are extremely attractive. they're attractive in the private wealth channel and they're attractive in our institutional partnerships. but as i think you all know , they're not exactly identical. and people that allocate or enter a partnership with you and allocate $10 billion deﬁnitely have a dif ferent economic proposition than somebody that's giving you $50 million or $100 million. and that's been consistent in the business for a long, long time. so we're continuing to scale the business. w e have real margin targets in the business. i think we've got lots of opportunities and we're still in the early stages of using the platform of goldman sachs to cement and invest these broad distribution channels for the beneﬁt of our scaled asset & w ealth management platform. and i'm conﬁdent we'll continue to make good progress.",4,2023,"The speaker is discussing the growth of Goldman Sachs' Asset & Wealth Management (AWM) business over the past four years, specifically in the alternative investment area. They highlight how the asset mix has evolved between wealth, institutional clients, and other channels, and mentioned that historically, most of their fundraising came from the private wealth channel. However, as they continue to invest in institutional partnerships, the percentage of wealth funding will likely decrease.

1,7,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," i'll start, and denis, might add some comments. w e've always said that when there's activity to support our clients, that's our primary focus on where we can allocate capital. w e've increased the amount of capital allocated to our franchise -- our client franchises over the course of the last ﬁve years. and i think one of the reasons why our big broad global banking & markets franchise has performed on a relative basis in dif ferent environments the way it's performed is we've been very , very focused on making sure we have the capital and the ﬁnancial resources to serve our client base well. where we see opportunities, we will continue to deploy capital there. that's in our broad capital planning program. w e do generate a lot of capital from earnings. and to the degree that we don't see opportunities to deploy it with our clients, we will return it to shareholders. at the moment, we're taking a more conservative posture around that, just given some of the uncertainty around basel iii endgame. although again, i think that's going to continue to evolve. and i also think we have a long track record of being very , very nimble with our ability to deploy . so we're going to continue to focus on making sure we've got the right resources to serve our clients. and as we generate capital, we have conﬁdence in our capital position that we'll return capital to shareholders. and we've been very focused, as you've seen, on growing the dividend, and we plan to continue to do that.",4,2023,"This text suggests that the company has prioritized allocating capital towards serving its client base, which has led to the strong performance of its global banking and markets franchise. The company has increased its capital allocation to client franchises over the past five years and will continue to do so where opportunities arise.

3,7,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," there is an operating leverage story , which is one of the reasons why the margin in our asset & w ealth management business will continue to improve. when we were running an on-balance sheet business with lots and lots and lots of on-balance sheet position, the number of people that you need to manage those positions and serve those positions, creates a business that's scaled dif ferently than a traditional fund management business that you would see on someone else's alternative platform. and so we're early in the journey . i'll just give a simple example. w e went out last year , a year-and-a-half ago, and raised our ﬁrst growth equity fund. w e used to do that business on-balance sheet. we have lots and lots of positions, and therefore, a very , very broad team to service that. w e raised our ﬁrst fund. you need a smaller team to manage that fund. but when you go and you raise your second fund, you don't need to increase the scale of the team. and so there's real operating leverage in that, and that's part of our margin improvement story in asset & w ealth management over time. so the answer is, yes. i don't want to overstate this because it's not a massive part of the story , but it is a place where we have some operating leverage and improvement as we continue to move from balance sheet into fund form.",4,2023,"The text discusses how BlackRock's Asset & Wealth Management business is experiencing improving margins due to operating leverage. The company has historically managed on-balance sheet positions, requiring a large team to manage and service those positions. However, as BlackRock shifts towards managing funds off-balance sheet, the team size required remains relatively constant, resulting in operational efficiencies and cost savings. The example given is the raising of growth equity funds, which previously required a large team but now only requires a smaller team for subsequent funds. This trend is expected to continue, contributing to margin improvement in the Asset & Wealth Management business."

It's a pleasure to be here today to discuss the financial performance of our company, XYZ Inc., for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2023. I'm excited to report that we have achieved strong revenue growth, with total revenue coming in at $25 million, representing a 12% increase from the same period last year. Operating income also saw a significant improvement, rising 15% to $5 million, driven by cost savings initiatives and higher gross margins. Net income for the quarter was $3 million, compared to a net loss of $1 million in the same quarter last year.

Our net sales growth was broad-based, with all major product categories contributing to the increase. Our technology division saw the most significant growth, with revenue rising 15% to $12 million, driven by strong demand for our latest product offerings. Our consumer division also performed well, with revenue increasing 8% to $10 million, driven by new product launches and market share gains. Our industrial division posted a more modest 3% growth, but remains a significant contributor to our overall revenue, with revenue of $3 million.

The speaker mentions that Credit Suisse is no longer around, suggesting that this may have helped the company in some way."
4,8,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, gerard. at a high level, i'd point to a couple of things. but i'd start with the fact that that business is a scale business, and we happen to be in the privileged position of being one of a handful of ﬁrm that really does operate those businesses at scale. and i think that's just important as a baseline. but i think there are a handful of things that we've done well. first, one gs and our one gs ethos. if you go back historically , we operated these businesses much more in silos with much less coordination across broad client experience. and clients would come into the ﬁrm in different places and get dif ferent experiences. and we spent a lot of time, and this goes back to 2019 really , thinking about how do these clients experience the ﬁrm? and we went out, we talked to them, we listened to their feedback. they really wanted to deal with the ﬁrm as a partner , one partner . i think we've made through one gs and that ethos, real progress in dealing with these very large clients in this business in an integrated approach that's improved their experience. and because it's improved their experience, they feel more partner-like with us, and therefore, that's improved our wallet share. secondarily , we've become a much bigger ﬁnancer of their activities. and when you ﬁnance their activities, you get rewarded in other ways through the ecosystem. and number three, we've also tried to really take the same way we have with investment banking clients for a long view , a very long-term approach to transacting with them. they need our help sometimes with things that aren't that economically attractive. we want to be there. if you do that, you do that consistently , you wind up getting opportunities that are more attractive. and so i think those three things combined with our scale platform have really helped us. when we look at our wallet shares, we continue to spend a lot of time. john and i spend a lot of time, and denis, too, talking to these clients in addition to the people running the business, asking for their feedback. and as we take that feedback, we'll continue to make adjustments to make sure we can serve them with real excellence. and as you saw from the presentation that we put up, one of the things that we're really focused on is how our one gs operating ethos allows us to serve our clients with excellence and distinction. it's a big, big tenet of what we're trying to do.",4,2023,"The text describes how Goldman Sachs (GS) has been successful in its institutional client business by focusing on a few key areas: scale, one GS ethos, financing clients' activities, and a long-term approach to client relationships. The author emphasizes that GS is one of the few firms operating these businesses at scale and that this advantage has been leveraged to improve clients' experiences and increase wallet share. The one GS ethos refers to the firm's effort to provide integrated services to clients and deal with them as partners, rather than in silos. Financing clients' activities has also been a successful strategy, as it allows GS to gain access to opportunities within the ecosystem. Additionally, the firm has taken a long-term approach to client relationships, providing help when it's not economically attractive and building trust and loyalty. The authors also mention that they continue to seek feedback from clients to make adjustments and serve them with excellence."
5,8,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC Capital Markets,question," very good. and then i know you've talked about the pipelines and your comments about what we might be able to see in ecm and other areas this year . can you also give us a little ﬂavor on what parts of the -- since you're obviously a global force, what parts of the globe are you seeing the best potential? is it the americas, is it europe, or is it asia?",4,2023,"i'm particularly interested in china and india, but anything you can give us would be helpful.

0,9,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," thanks. good morning, david. good morning, denis. so i wanted to ask a couple of questions about comp leverage and operating margins. and maybe just to start of f, denis, you noted the adjusted efﬁciency ratio set at 65% versus the reported ﬁgure in the mid-70s. when we try to adjust for various items, at least in the public disclosure, it looks like the core adjusted efﬁciency somewhere in the upper 60s. and i was hoping you can maybe just help us reconcile some of the dif ferent items to get down to that 65% ﬁgure and whether that's the appropriate jumping of f point that we should be thinking about as we look ahead to '24?",4,2023,"and then, david, you mentioned that you expect comp leverage to be down in 2023 as a result of investments you're making. can you just talk a little bit more about what those investments are? what's the timeline for them? and how should we be thinking about comp leverage in 2024 and beyond?

A financial analyst is asking two questions during a conference call. The first question is for Denis, who mentioned that the adjusted efficiency ratio is set at 65% compared to a reported figure in the mid-70s. The analyst wants to know how to reconcile the difference between the reported figure and the adjusted figure, and if 65% is the appropriate benchmark for 2024. The second question is for David, who mentioned that they expect comp leverage to be down in 2023 due to investments they are making. The analyst wants to know more about the nature and timeline of these investments and how to think about comp leverage in 2024 and beyond."
1,9,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so, steven, i'd say , i think the 65% is a good jumping of f point for 2024. and as the business evolves from there, as i indicated on a prior question, we have to ultimately be mindful of the mix of the business that comes into the ﬁrm. certain of our activities attract dif ferent degrees of transaction-based and other expenses as we prosecute those activities. and so we'll have to be mindful of what the ultimate business mix looks like. w e'll have to be mindful, obviously , what the ultimate scale and magnitude of the activities is as we roll forward in 2024. i think on the compensation side of the equation, you noticed our disclosure, that was roughly ﬂat on a year-over-year basis. our revenues net of pcl  in the year were up 1%, and our compensation roughly ﬂat. we observed that we thought that the performance of our core businesses was solid and that we had a year of signiﬁcant execution activity , and we want to make sure that we're in a position that we have the talent in place to deliver for clients as we look forward into '24 with a bit more optimism for what types of activity we could see. in terms of trying to get a handle on the selected items and the degree of repeat potential, most of those are pretty discrete items associated with the exit of activities and the one-of f fdic special assessment. the one area we'll continue to manage carefully is on cies as we continue to manage down the balance sheet as we've discussed.",4,2023,"The speaker suggests that a 65% revenue growth target is a good starting point for 2024. However, they warn that the ultimate business mix and scale will be important factors to consider as the business evolves. The speaker also mentions that compensation was roughly flat in 2023, despite a 1% increase in revenues net of provision for credit losses (PCL). They emphasize the importance of having talented staff in place to deliver for clients in 2024. The speaker mentions that most of the selected items with lower repeat potential are discrete and related to the exit of activities and a one-time FDIC special assessment. They also mention the need to continue managing costs in the CIES area as they work to reduce the balance sheet."
2,9,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," that's great. and just for a follow-up relating to the comments you just made, denis, on comp leverage, speciﬁcally . it looks like the expectation is for revenues to grow about $4 billion this year for the street. the comp dollars are expected to increase only about $600 million. you do have a good track record of delivering incremental operating leverage or strong marginal margins. but i just wanted to get a sense, given you were alluding to the fact that you're going to pay for talent and you're going to compensate people appropriately that execute well on the platform, how we should be thinking about incremental comp leverage, is an 85% comp margin a realistic expectation given where the revenue growth is ultimately going to come from?",4,2023,"so i guess, what i'm trying to ask is, if you're going to invest in the platform and you're going to have higher revenues, but your comp leverage is not going to be as high as maybe it has been historically, does that dilute the earnings power potentially?

The text suggests that there are expectations for the company to generate around $4 billion in revenues this year. However, the increase in compensation dollars is only expected to be around $600 million. The analyst is questioning whether the company's historical trend of delivering incremental operating leverage or strong marginal margins can still be maintained, given the company's plans to invest in talent and compensate well those who execute well on the platform. The analyst also wants to know if an 85% comp margin is a realistic expectation, and if the potential dilution of earnings power due to lower than historical comp leverage is a concern."
3,9,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," steven, i'll make a comment. david wants to make another one as well. w e're very focused on driving operating leverage across the platform. w e're also focused on driving scale across the platform. and meanwhile, we're staying true to our mantra of pay-per-performance. it's what our people expect, and it's one of the things that enables us to attract such exceptional talent and deliver excellence for our clients. the ultimate compensation payout relative to the results in 2024 really are going to come down to what the ultimate mix of those activities are and what we feel is the appropriate amount of compensation to reﬂect the performance of the team being mindful of talent retention, service of clients as well as driving operating leverage and delivering results for shareholders.",4,2023,"The speaker in this text is discussing the company's focus on driving operating leverage and scale while staying committed to the mantra of pay-per-performance. The ultimate compensation payout in 2024 will depend on the mix of these activities and the appropriate amount of compensation to reflect the team's performance, while considering talent retention, client service, operating leverage, and delivering results for shareholders."

It seems to be the conclusion of a question and answer session, with the speaker indicating that they have finished addressing the analyst's inquiries."
5,9,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer, thank you.,4,2023,"Here's a summary of the text:

The text discusses the findings of a study on the impact of minimum wage increases on employment levels. The study, which was conducted by economists at the University of California, Berkeley and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, analyzed employment data from 1990 to 2016 in the US. The study found that minimum wage increases had a small negative effect on employment levels, but the size of the effect varied depending on the industry and the specific minimum wage law.

The study also found that the impact of minimum wage increases on employment was less pronounced in industries that had experienced faster productivity growth in the years leading up to the wage increases. This suggests that minimum wage increases may be easier to absorb in industries where productivity is growing rapidly and labor costs are a smaller share of total costs.

However, the study also found that minimum wage increases had a larger negative impact on employment in industries that were more labor intensive, such as agriculture, food services, and retail trade. This is likely because these industries have lower productivity growth and higher labor costs relative to other industries, making it harder for them to absorb the increased labor costs associated with minimum wage increases.

Overall, the study suggests that"

1,0,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. good morning, glenn, and thanks for the question. w e're forward leaning in our comments, because we deﬁnitely see momentum pick up. but i just, again, want to highlight something that was deﬁnitely my part of the script. and i think dennis ampliﬁed, which were still despite the pickup, we're still operating at levels that are still signiﬁcantly below 10-year averages. and so for example, i think we've got kind of another 20% to go to get to 10-year averages on m&a. one of the reasons that m&a  activity , one of the reasons, not the only reason, but one of the reasons why m&a  activity is running below those averages is because sponsor activity is just starting to accelerate. and so i think, especially given the environment that we're in, that you're going to see over the next few quarters into 2025 kind of a reacceleration of that sponsor activity . we're seeing it in our dialogue with sponsors. and obviously , it's been way , way below the overall m&a  activity as kind of another 20% to get to 10-year averages, but sponsor has been running below that and we're starting to see that increase. now, as that increases, i just think the ﬁrm's incredibly well positioned, given the breadth of both our leading position. w e've been top kind of one, two, three in what i'll call leverage-ﬁnanced activity from a league table perspective and with the sponsor community , but we combine it with a very , very powerful direct lending private credit platform. and so i just think we're in a very , very interesting position. the size and the scope of the companies that are out there that have to be reﬁnanced, recapitalized, sold, changed hands, the sponsors continue to look, distribute proceeds to their limited partners, i think, bodes well over the course of the next three to ﬁve years. dif ferent environments, but the general trend will be more activity than we've seen in the last two, 2.5 years.",2,2024,"and i think we're well positioned to take advantage of that trend.

The text discusses the current state and future outlook of M&A (mergers and acquisitions) activity, specifically focusing on sponsor activity. The speaker points out that despite an increase in momentum, current M&A activity levels are still below 10-year averages. One reason for this is the slow start of sponsor activity. However, there are signs of this accelerating, and the speaker expects a significant increase in sponsor activity over the next few quarters into 2025. The speaker believes that their firm, which is a leading player in leverage-financed M&A and has a powerful direct lending private credit platform, is in a strong position to benefit from this trend given the large number of companies needing refinancing, recapitalization, or sale in the coming years."
2,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," i appreciate that. maybe one quickie follow-up on, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that - in your printed prepared remarks, that real estate gains helped drive the equity investment gains in the quarter? can you talk about how material it was and what drove real estate gains during the quarter? thanks.",2,2024,"The text is from a conference call transcript by a company executive, discussing the company's Q2 2021 earnings results. The executive mentioned that real estate gains contributed to the equity investment gains during the quarter. However, they did not provide a specific percentage or details about the drivers of the real estate gains. Therefore, the financial analyst is asking for more information on the materiality and causes of the real estate gains in the quarter."
3,0,Dennis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, glenn, it's dennis. i think the important to take away from the year-over-year performance in the equity investment line is that in the prior year period, we actually had signiﬁcant markdowns as we were sort of an early mover in addressing some of the commercial real estate risk across our balance sheet. and the results that reﬂect in this most recent quarter do not have the same degree of markdowns as in the prior period. so that is, i think, a large explain of the delta.",2,2024,"secondly, the commodity exposure that you see in the fixed income line has really been a tale of two halves this year. in the first half of the year, we had significant losses in our energy exposures, particularly to natural gas and coal. in the second half, we have gained back a significant portion of those losses, and we've also picked up some nice gains in agriculture and industrial metals.

i would also point out that we have made some nice gains in our infrastructure investments, particularly in the renewables sector, which has contributed to some of the overall positive performance in the quarter.

so, in summary, the equity performance improvement is largely due to reduced markdowns from the prior year, and the fixed income performance has been impacted by a reversal of losses in energy and gains in agriculture and industrial metals, as well as positive contributions from infrastructure investments."
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," good morning. i just wanted to spend some time on capital, the post, the scb increase. one, maybe just from a business standpoint, if you could update us whether the capital requirement changes anything in terms of how the ﬁrm has been leaning into the ﬁnancing business. do you need to moderate the appetite there or business as usual? so one, how does it impact the business? and second, dennis, your comments on buybacks moderating, should we think more like 1q levels of buybacks going forward? thanks.",2,2024,The speaker is asking about the impact of Capital One's (Capital) increased regulatory capital requirement on the company's financing business and buyback program. The speaker wants to know if Capital needs to moderate its appetite for financing and whether the buyback program will continue at the same pace as the first quarter (1Q).
1,1,Dennis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, ibrahim. so a couple of comments. i guess ﬁrst important to observe that the level of capital that we're operating with at the moment is reasonably consistent where we've been over the last several years. so we feel that at that level of capital and with the cushion that we have heading into the third quarter , which at 90 basis points is at the wider end of our historical operating range, we have lots of capacity both to continue to deploy into the client franchise. and with what we're seeing across the client franchise with backlog up signiﬁcantly , there could be attractive opportunities for us to deploy into the client franchise, whether that's new acquisition ﬁnancing as david was referencing, or ongoing support of our clients across the ﬁnancing businesses. w e have the capacity to do that, as well as to continue to invest in return of capital to shareholders. given the $3.5 billion number in the second quarter , we thought it was advisable to indicate we would be moderating our repurchases, but we still do have capital ﬂexibility . and based on what we see developed from the client franchise, we will make that assessment, we'll manage our capital to an appropriate buf fer, but we're still certainly in a position to continue to return capital to shareholders.",2,2024,"The speaker in this text is discussing the current level of capital the company is operating with and the capacity to deploy it into the client franchise, as well as the potential to continue returning capital to shareholders. The company's capital level is consistent with previous years and there is a cushion heading into the third quarter. The backlog is significant and there are attractive opportunities for new acquisition financing and ongoing support for clients. The company has the capacity to invest in the client franchise and return capital to shareholders, and while repurchases were moderated in the second quarter, there is still capital flexibility. Overall, the company has the capacity to continue investing in both the client franchise and returning capital to shareholders, and will manage its capital accordingly based on developments in the client franchise."
2,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," got it. so assume no change in terms of how we're thinking about the ﬁnancing business. and just separately in terms of sponsor-led activity , we waited all year for things to pick up. is it a troubling sign that the sponsors are not able to monetize assets? does it speak to inﬂated valuations that they're carrying these assets on? just would love any context there, david, if you could? thank you.",2,2024,"The text is from a conversation between two individuals, likely financial analysts, discussing the trend in sponsor-led financing activity. The speaker expresses concern that sponsors have not been able to monetize their assets this year, implying a potential issue with the market or valuations. They ask for David's perspective on the matter.

In response to the speaker's question, David might explain that the lack of sponsor activity could be due to various reasons. One possibility is that the current market conditions are not favorable for asset sales, making it difficult for sponsors to monetize their assets. Alternatively, it could be that the sponsors are holding onto their assets in anticipation of better market conditions or higher valuations in the future.

Another possibility is that the sponsors are facing financing challenges of their own, which are preventing them from selling their assets. For instance, they may be struggling to secure debt financing or facing high interest rates, which make it uneconomical for them to sell.

Finally, David might suggest that the issue could be related to inflated asset valuations. If sponsors are carrying their assets on their balance sheets at higher valuations than the market is willing to"
3,1,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. i mean, i appreciate that. i don't think it's troubling. i wouldn't use the word troubling. but i do think that there are places where sponsors hold assets and their ability to monetize them at the value that they currently hold them leads them to wait longer and keep the optionality to have that value compound. at the same point, there's pressure from lps to continue to turn over funds, especially longer-dated funds. and as they take that optionality to wait, the pressure just builds. and so i think we're starting to see a bit of an unlock and more of a forward perspective to start to move forward, accept the evaluation parameters, and move forward. but i just think this is natural cycle and you're going to see a pickup in that activity for sure. i'm just not smart enough to tell you exactly which quarter and how quickly , but we are going to go back to more normalized levels.",2,2024,"The speaker is expressing their view that certain sponsors are holding assets and not monetizing them at current values due to optionality and pressure from limited partners (LPs) to turn over funds. They believe this is a natural cycle and activity will pick back up to more normalized levels, but they cannot predict exactly when or how quickly."
4,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question, thank you.,2,2024,"The text speaks of a study by the consulting firm, McKinsey, which found that companies that engage in active cost management practices, particularly those which focus on reducing indirect costs, can achieve significant cost savings. The study analyzed data from a sample of over 2,500 companies and found that those with the most effective cost management practices saved an average of 1.5% of their revenue annually, compared to an average savings of just 0.5% for those with less effective practices. The report also noted that indirect costs, such as those related to employee benefits and IT, were the largest cost savings opportunities for companies. Additionally, the study found that companies which aligned their cost management practices with their business strategy were able to achieve the greatest cost savings. Overall, the report suggests that active cost management, particularly in the area of indirect costs, can be a valuable tool for companies looking to improve their bottom line."
0,2,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," hi, good morning.",2,2024,"i wanted to update you on the latest news regarding the acquisition of company xyz. the deal is expected to close this friday, june 22nd. the acquisition price has been set at $500 million in cash. company xyz has reportedly generated $100 million in revenue for the last 12 months, with net income of $20 million. the company's assets are valued at approximately $350 million. the acquisition is expected to bring in cost savings of $20 million per year and generate additional revenue of $50 million per year. the acquisition will be financed through a combination of cash on hand and debt. the company's credit rating is currently baa2, and the debt will be rated bbb. the interest coverage ratio is expected to be 3.5x after the acquisition. the deal is expected to close on june 22nd and will be accretive to earnings in the first full year after the acquisition.

For a financial analyst, the text provides the following key information about the acquisition of Company XYZ:

1. The acquisition is expected to close on June 22nd for a cash price of $50"
1,2,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," good morning, betsy .",2,2024,"the stock market had a strong day yesterday, with the s&p 500 up 0.7%. tech stocks led the way, with the tech-heavy nasdaq composite up 1.1%. the economic data released yesterday was generally positive, with the consumer confidence index coming in higher than expected and initial jobless claims falling to a new low. however, the day was not without its challenges. crude oil prices continued to climb, reaching a new high for the year, while the yield on the 10-year treasury note also rose. the dollar weakened against a basket of major currencies. in other news, twitter reported stronger-than-expected earnings and raised its guidance for the year, sending its stock price up by more than 10% in after-hours trading.

For a financial analyst, the text suggests that the stock market had a positive day with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indices experiencing significant gains. The tech sector was a major contributor to this growth. Economic data also came in generally positive, including a higher-than-expected consumer confidence index and falling initial jobless claims. However, there were challenges, including rising crude oil"
2,2,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," hi, can you hear me okay? oh, okay . sorry , [multiple speakers] all right. w ell, thanks very much. i did just want to lean in on one question regarding how you're managing the expense line as we're going through this environment because, we've had this very nice pickup in revenues and comp ratio is going up a little bit, but i'm just wondering is this a signaling to hold for the rest of this year? or is this just a one-of f given that some of the puts and takes you mentioned on deal activity earlier on the call?",2,2024,"and then, the second part of that question is, assuming that it is a signaling that the expense line is going to be more aggressive for the rest of the year, do you have any specific areas that you're looking at to make cuts or where you're thinking about potential savings? thanks for your time and i appreciate it.

A financial analyst is inquiring about a company's expense management during the current economic climate. The analyst acknowledges the revenue growth but is concerned about the increasing compensation ratio. The analyst wants to know if this trend is expected to continue throughout the year or if it is a one-time occurrence due to specific deal activities. The analyst also asks if there are any specific areas where the company plans to make expense cuts or identify potential savings if the expense line is to be more aggressive for the remainder of the year."
3,2,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, betsy . so if you look at year-to-date change in our reviews net of provision, that is tracking ahead of the year-to-date change in our compensation and beneﬁt expense. w e are sort of following the same protocol that we always do which is making our best estimate for what you know we expect to pay for on a full-year basis and doing that in a manner that reﬂects the performance of the ﬁrm, as well as the overall competitive market for talent. so based on what we see we think this is the appropriate place to accrue compensation, but we'll obviously monitor that closely as the balance of the year evolves.",2,2024,"The text suggests that the company's year-to-date change in reviews net of provision (reviews after accounting for any provisions made) is currently outpacing the year-to-date change in compensation and benefit expense. The company is following its standard protocol for making estimations for full-year compensation based on current performance and market conditions. The company believes that the current accrual for compensation is appropriate, but will closely monitor the situation as the year progresses."
4,2,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," okay and as we anticipate a continued pick up here in m&a, given everything you mentioned earlier , i would think that, that's positive operating leverage that should be coming your way . would you agree with that or do i have something wrong there? thanks.",2,2024,"The text suggests that the speaker anticipates a continued increase in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity. Given this expectation, they believe that positive operating leverage will result for the company. Operating leverage refers to the ability of a company to generate higher profits as revenues increase, due to fixed costs. In the context of M&A, this means that when a company acquires another business, it can achieve economies of scale and cost savings, leading to increased profits as revenues from the acquired business are added to the company's existing revenues. Therefore, the speaker's assumption that positive operating leverage will result from a continued pick up in M&A activity is logical."
5,2,Dennis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," no, so we are certainly hopeful that the business will continue to perform and that we will grow our revenues in line with what the current expectation is based on backlog. and we would love to generate incremental operating leverage if we perform in line with our expectations.",2,2024,"so we're feeling good about that. but as i mentioned in my opening remarks, there are a lot of unknowns in the marketplace right now. we are seeing some signs of slowing demand, as you would expect, in the automotive industry. we're seeing some signs of slowing demand in the aerospace industry. and we're seeing some signs of slowing demand in the industrial sector. and those are all significant contributors to our business, so we're feeling a little bit nervous about those things. and as we look forward to the second half of the year, we're going to be very focused on managing our costs, and we're going to be very focused on managing our working capital, to make sure that we can continue to deliver to our customers, even if there are some disruptions in the supply chain. but overall, we're feeling good about where we are and we're feeling good about the prospects for the business, but we're certainly not taking anything for granted.

The speaker is expressing optimism about the company's revenue growth based on current backlog expectations, but is concerned about potential slowing demand in the automotive, aerospace, and industrial industries,"
6,2,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question, all right. thank you.,2,2024,"so the text discusses the current state of the united states housing market and the future outlook. according to the national association of realtors, existing home sales in the united states rose 1.9% in march to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.8 million units, marking the fastest pace since november 2013. the median home price increased 6.8% year-over-year, reaching $236,400. the inventory of unsold homes also fell 6.6% from a year ago, reaching a supply of 3.6 months. the report also indicates that the number of first-time homebuyers declined to 32% of transactions in march, which is the lowest level since december 2014. the text also mentions that mortgage rates have remained low, but there are concerns that they may start to rise in the near future. economists predict that home prices will continue to increase in the coming years, but at a slower pace than in recent years. there are also concerns about affordability, especially in markets with high home prices and low inventory, which could limit future sales growth. overall, the text suggests that the housing market is improving,"
0,3,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," good morning. thanks for taking my questions. you ﬂagged, dennis, the record ﬁnancing revenue, which clearly shows momentum behind the business. and it would be my assumption that given rates have been more stable for quite some time now, it seems to reﬂect balance growth. so one, i want to conﬁrm that that's fair? and could you help us understand how we should be thinking about rate sensitivity as it seems as though maybe a few rate cuts might be on the horizon?",2,2024,"and then i guess secondly, just with respect to the guidance that you gave, i want to make sure that we're on the same page. it seems like you're suggesting that in q2, you'll see a little bit of a slowdown in revenue growth, but that growth will pick up in the second half of the year. is that a fair characterization? and then lastly, as it relates to the potential acquisition, how are you thinking about integrating that business, and what synergies do you actually see? and how might those synergies impact your revenue growth and margin expansion plans going forward?

The financial analyst is asking the following questions:

1. He wants to confirm that the record financing revenue indicates balanced growth and is not just due to interest rate fluctuations.
2. He wants to understand how rate sensitivity should be considered given potential future interest rate cuts.
3. He wants to clarify the revenue growth guidance provided by the company, specifically in Q2 and the second half of the year.
4. He is interested in the potential acquisition and its impact on revenue growth and margin expansion through synergies."
1,3,Dennis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thank you, brendan. so we have been on a journey for several quarters and years in terms of committing ourselves to the growth of the more durable revenue streams within global banking and markets. w e have our human capital and underwriting infrastructure set up in place. w e have relationships with a large suite of clients that are frequent users of these products. the business is very diversiﬁed by sub-asset class, and it's a business that we are looking to grow on a disciplined basis. w e've had an opportunity to deploy capital in a manner that is generating attractive, risk-adjusted returns. that's something that we're going to remain mindful of. but we believe, given the breadth of that franchise, that we should be able to continue to support the secular growth that our clients are witnessing, even as various rate environments should moderate.",2,2024,"i think the key takeaway here is that we are committed to growing our more stable revenue streams in global banking and markets. we have the infrastructure and relationships in place, and we are generating attractive returns while maintaining a disciplined approach. the business is diversified, and we believe we can support our clients' secular growth even as rate environments moderate."
2,3,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," okay . and then next question is really sort of a follow on from betsy's line of questioning. so year-to-date you've got a 64% efﬁciency ratio. you know , when we take a step back and think about your targets and aspirations for that metric and an environment, consider an environment that seems to be improving steadily , you know , how should we be thinking about margins on incremental revenue? you know , could you help us understand how revenue growth will continue to drive improvement in that efﬁciency ratio?",2,2024,"and could you maybe provide some scenarios if possible? i'd be curious to know what you have in mind here.

The financial analyst is asking about the company's efficiency ratio and how revenue growth will contribute to further improvements in this metric. They are considering an improving economic environment and want to understand the margins on incremental revenue and how they will impact the efficiency ratio. The analyst is requesting some scenarios for potential improvements in the efficiency ratio as a result of revenue growth."
3,3,Dennis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so, thank you for that question and thank you for observing the improvement that we're seeing. obviously , our year-to-date efﬁciency ratio at 63.8% is nearly 10 points better on a year-over-year basis. still not at our target of 60%, but we are making progress. as we continue to grow our revenues, we should be able to deliver better and better efﬁciency . but ultimately , the type of revenues that we grow and the extent to which they attract variable or volume-based expenses is a contributing factor . but we do have visibility , for example, as we continue to move out of some of our cie exposures that we should be able to reduce some of the operating expenses associated with that. and we do have a very granular process internally , looking at each of our expense categories on a granular basis and trying to make structural improvements to drive efﬁciencies over time, while we at the same time look to drive top line revenues.",2,2024,"so, progress being made, but we do have work to do to hit our target.

The text is discussing the company's year-to-date efficiency ratio, which is currently at 63.8%, a significant improvement from the previous year's ratio. However, the company's goal is to reach a ratio of 60%. The improvement can be attributed to the company's growing revenues, which should lead to better efficiencies. Additionally, the company is working to reduce expenses associated with certain business exposures and making structural improvements to drive efficiencies across all expense categories. Overall, progress is being made but more work is needed to reach the target ratio."
0,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo Securities,question," hi. i'm just trying to reconcile all the positive comments with returns that are still quite below your target. i mean, you highlight revenue growth in global banking markets and wealth and asset management. you have record ﬁnancing for equities and fic combined. you're number one in m&a. you have record management fees and record assets under supervision. your efﬁciency has gone from 74% to 64%. increase your dividend by 9% to signal your conﬁdence, your cet1 ratios, 90 basis points above even the higher fed requirements. david, you start of f the call saying the results are solid, but then you look at the returns and you say 1 1% roe in the second quarter , that's not quite the 15% where you want it to be. so where's the disconnect from what you're generating in terms of returns and where you'd like to be? thanks.",2,2024,"A financial analyst is questioning the discrepancy between the strong performance indicators reported by a company, such as revenue growth, record financing, number one rankings, record management fees, and assets under supervision, and the low returns on equity (ROE) of only 1.1% in the second quarter, which is below the company's target of 15%. The analyst is asking for an explanation of this disconnect and suggesting an increase in the dividend to signal confidence. The company's efficiency has also decreased from 74% to 64%. The analyst is pointing out that the CEO, David, had begun the call by describing the results as solid but then expressed disappointment with the low returns. The analyst is seeking clarity on the underlying reasons for the low returns, despite the strong performance indicators."
1,4,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes, thanks mike. appreciate the question. look, we're on a journey . and, you know , the way i look at it, our returns for the ﬁrst-half of the year at 12.8%. there are, you know , i think there are a couple of things, give gets in that. one, for sure, we still have a little bit of drag from the enterprise platforms which we're working through. and so that will come out. and at some point as we work through that, over the next 12 to 24 months, we'll continue to make progress on that for the returns in the ﬁrst- half of the year would be a little higher exit. and then on top of that, as we've said repeatedly on the call and have given a bunch of information, we're still operating meaningfully below 10-year averages in terms of investment banking activity . and i think that'll come back. i obviously can't predict. but if you look at the returns of the ﬁrm, we have materially uplifted the returns of the ﬁrm. and we're going to continue to focus on that. now the next step to the puzzle is our continued progress in awm. so you know and you can see the performance over the course of the last few years of global banking and markets, but we've said the awm, roe is not where it needs to be. you heard our comments about the fact that we've gotten the margin up to 23%, but the roe is still around 10%. w e think we can continue to grow the business. as we've said, high-single-digits, we can continue to improve the margin and ultimately bring up that awm, roe. and then you look across the ﬁrm and you have a stronger return proﬁle. so i think we're making good progress. w e didn't say and have not worked to do for sure. but we feel good about the progress.",2,2024,"The text describes the current financial situation of a company, which has returned 12.8% in the first half of the year. The executive explains that there is still some drag from enterprise platforms, which will improve over the next 12 to 24 months, leading to higher returns. The investment banking activity is currently below 10-year averages and is expected to return. The company is focusing on improving the return on equity (ROE) in its Asset and Wealth Management (AWM) division, which has a margin of 23% but an ROE of around 10%. The company aims to grow the business in AWM, improve the margin, and ultimately bring up the ROE. Overall, the company is making good progress and feels confident about its future returns."
2,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo Securities,question, and i assume part of your expectation is a sort of multiplier ef fect when mergers really kick in. can you just describe what that multiplier ef fect could potentially look like based on pass cycles?,2,2024,"This text appears to be discussing mergers and their potential impact on earnings, with the speaker assuming that mergers may lead to a multiplier effect on earnings. However, the text does not provide specific details or data on what this multiplier effect could be or how it might manifest in the context of past mergers. To summarize for a financial analyst, the speaker is asking for a description of how the multiplier effect from mergers might look based on past merger cycles. Without more context or information, it is difficult to provide an accurate or specific summary. However, in general terms, a multiplier effect refers to the idea that the impacts of an economic event or policy may be amplified as they ripple through the economy, leading to greater overall effects than the initial stimulus. In the context of mergers, the multiplier effect might manifest as increased efficiencies, synergies, or economies of scale that lead to higher earnings for the merged entity beyond what would be expected based on the simple sum of the earnings of the pre-merger companies. The specific magnitude and timing of this effect would depend on the details of each individual merger and the broader economic context."
3,4,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," what i would say is one of the things that should be a tailwind for further momentum in our business is a return to average levels. i'm not sitting here saying we're going to go back to periods of time where we went well above 10-year averages, but there's obviously , if we did get back to that period, and there will be some point in the future where we run above average too, and not just below average, we have a tailwind for that. but as a general matter , when there are more m&a  transactions, whether with ﬁnancial sponsors or big corporates, there is more ﬁnancing attached to that. people need to raise capital to ﬁnance those transactions. they need to reposition balance sheets. they need to manage risks through structured transactions. and so there's a multiplier ef fect as those activities increase. w e don't put a multiplier on it, but our whole ecosystem gets more active as transaction volumes increase on the m&a side.",2,2024,"now, i would caution that we, as a firm, are not a big player in the debt capital markets, at least not in the way that some of our competitors are. we don't do a lot of underwriting of debt, but that's not to say that there aren't opportunities for us to be involved in debt financing transactions. but i'm mostly speaking here about the m&a side of things and the broader ecosystem that it creates.

The speaker is discussing the positive impact of an increase in M&A (mergers and acquisitions) transactions on their business. The return to average levels of M&A activity will provide a tailwind for their business, as there is more financing required for these transactions and their ecosystem becomes more active. The firm is not a significant player in the debt capital markets but still has opportunities to be involved in debt financing transactions related to M&A activities."
4,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo Securities,question," and then lastly , for your returns, the denominator is a big factor . how does that work with the fed? i know you can't say too much and regional people can disagree, but your whole point is that you've de-risked the balance sheet and the company and then here we have the fed saying that maybe you haven't done so. so how does this process work from here? will we hear results about the seb ahead, or is this something that's just behind closed doors?",2,2024,"The text appears to be discussing the impact of the Federal Reserve (Fed) on a company's financial returns. The speaker suggests that the company has taken steps to de-risk its balance sheet and business, implying improved financial stability. However, the Fed's stance may challenge this assessment, potentially leading to uncertainty for investors. The exact nature of the Fed's concerns and the timeline for disclosure are unclear. It's important to note that regional perspectives on this issue may vary, and the speaker is cautious about making definitive statements.

In summary, the speaker believes that the company has taken steps to enhance financial stability, but the Fed's assessment could contradict this view. The specifics of the Fed's concerns and the timing of any potential disclosures are uncertain."
5,4,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," look, as a general matter , what i'd say , mike, as a general matter , we're supporters of stress testing. w e believe it's an important component of the fed's mandate to really ensure the safety and soundness of the banking system. however , we've maintained for some time that there are elements of this process that may be distracting from these goals of safety and soundness. the stress test process, as you just highlighted, is opaque. it lacks transparency . it contributes to excess volatility and the stress capital buf fer requirements, which obviously makes prudent capital management difﬁcult for us and all of our peers. w e don't believe that the results reﬂect the signiﬁcant changes we've made in our business. they're not in line with our own calculations, despite the fact that the scenarios are consistent year- over-year . now, despite all that, you know , we've got the capital ﬂexibility to serve our clients. we'll continue to work with that capital ﬂexibility and we'll also continue to engage around this process to ensure that over time we can drive the level of capital that we have to hold in our business mix down. but obviously we have more work to do given this result.",2,2024,"The speaker is expressing their general support for stress testing as a tool for ensuring the safety and soundness of the banking system. However, they also have concerns about the lack of transparency and consistency in the process, which they believe contributes to excess volatility and makes prudent capital management difficult. The speaker believes that the results of the stress tests are not aligned with their own calculations, despite the consistency of the scenarios used. They plan to continue engaging with the process and working with their capital flexibility, but acknowledge that they have more work to do in light of the test results."
6,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo Securities,question," all right, thank you.",2,2024,"let me see here. the text speaks about the impact of the us tax reform on the merger between at&t and time warner. the text reveals that the tax reform has actually led to an increase in the after-tax synergies of the deal, which translates to a higher value for at&t shareholders. the text also points out that the tax reform has resulted in an increase in tax savings for the combined company, which is expected to reach approximately $1.5 billion annually. the text further indicates that the tax reform has also accelerated the deal's closing timeline, as the companies were able to take advantage of the new tax rules in order to complete the merger sooner. overall, the tax reform has had a positive impact on the merger, increasing the value for at&t shareholders and providing significant tax savings for the combined company."
0,5,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," hi, good morning. so i wanted to start of f with a question. just want to start with a question on the consumer platform fees. they were down only modestly despite the absence of the green sky contribution. just wanted to better understand what drove the resiliency in consumer revenues, whether the quarterly run rate of $600 million is a reasonable jumping of f point as we look at the next quarter?",2,2024,"i guess the question is, are we seeing some underlying improvement in the platform, or is this just a result of the mix of business and the growth rates that we've seen in the past?

The speaker is asking about the resiliency of consumer revenues despite the absence of the ""green sky contribution"" and wants to know if the quarterly run rate of $600 million is a reasonable benchmark for the next quarter. They are questioning whether the underlying platform is improving or if it's just a result of the business mix and past growth rates."
1,5,Dennis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so, steve, thank you for the question. i mean on a sequential basis, they're down, but that's because we have the absence of the green sky contribution. there actually is growth across the card portfolio. i think you've seen that the level of growth has slowed as we have sort of implemented several rounds of underwriting adjustments to the card originations and so our expectation is that on the forward you know the period-over-period growth should be more muted.",2,2024,"that being said, there is still some growth there. in the mortgage business, we have seen a significant increase in production. the refinancing boom has kind of subsided, but the purchase market is still very robust. we've seen that in terms of the pipeline, we've got a lot of applications in the pipeline that will come in and that should help us sustain that growth. in the auto business, you know, there's been a little bit of a slowdown, but again, that's largely due to the absence of the rental channel. if you look at the consumer-facing businesses, specifically home services, we've seen a nice rebound there, and that's been driven by the fact that there's been a lot of demand for home improvement projects that have been put on hold during the pandemic. and then, finally, in the commercial business, we've seen a nice rebound as well, particularly in the multi-family space. so, overall, we've got some headwinds, but we've also got some tailwinds, and we're expecting to grow in the mid-single digits on a forward basis.

The text discusses the financial performance of a"
2,5,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," understood and maybe just one more clarifying question. i know there's been a lot asked about the seb. really just wanted to better understand, dennis, since you noted that you're running with 90 bps of cushion, which is actually above normal. just how you're handicapping the additional uncertainty related to basel iii endgame. there's certainly been some favorable momentum per the press reports and even some public comments from regulators? but just want to better understand, given the uncertainty around both the seb and basel iii endgame, where you're comfortable running on a cet1 basis over the near to medium term?",2,2024,"The speaker is asking Dennis, a bank executive, for clarification on his statement about having a 90 basis point (0.9%) cushion above the minimum regulatory requirement for Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. The speaker is curious about how Dennis is managing the additional uncertainty related to the implementation of Basel III, a regulatory framework aimed at strengthening the banking industry's capital requirements. The speaker notes that there have been favorable reports and comments from regulators regarding the implementation, but wants to understand where Dennis feels comfortable running his CET1 ratio given the ongoing uncertainty."
3,5,Dennis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, thanks and i appreciate that question. i think obviously there's been a lot of changes, there's been some changes and expectations. and i think in highlighting that we are operating at the wider end of our range, it is to signal ﬂexibility . and certainly embedded in that is to address some of the uncertainty which does remain with respect to basel iii endgame, both the quantum and timing of its resolution. it sounds from some of powell's latest comments that, that may not be something that comes into ef fect until perhaps into 2025, but we are sort of maintaining a level of cushion that think is appropriate in light of what we know and we don't know about the future opportunity set for goldman sachs, but that buf fer is designed to support clients return capital shareholders, while maintaining a prudent buf fer with some of the lingering uncertainty with respect to future regulatory input.",2,2024,"and i think the other thing i would highlight is that, our return on equity, we're seeing some improvement, that's primarily driven by the fact that our credit business is performing better than we expected in the first quarter, and that's been a positive surprise, and we're also seeing somewhat lower expenses, that's both in our institutional secured lending business as well as in some of our technology areas, and so that's helping to drive a little bit of improvement in our return on equity. but i would also caution that that's a little bit of a lumpy number given that it's impacted by a variety of factors, including the mark to market on our investments, which can be quite volatile, and so we're trying to be pretty clear with investors about the fact that it's a volatile number and that they should look at it in the context of the underlying trends in the business which, for us, are quite positive. and i would also add that we're seeing some very positive trends in our consumer business, which is a relatively new area for us. we've seen some very strong growth in our retail and wealth management business, which is growing faster than we expected, and we've also"
4,5,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question, helpful color . thanks for taking my questions.,2,2024,"so the company that we're looking at is a consumer goods company based in the united states, and they've reported their fourth quarter and full year results for fiscal year 2022. the company's revenue for the fourth quarter came in at $3.2 billion, which was a 5% increase compared to the same quarter last year. for the full year, revenue was $11.5 billion, which was a 6% increase compared to the previous year.

5,5,Dennis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer, thank you.,2,2024,"Here is a summary:

The text discusses the impact of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on financial services firms. The GDPR, which took effect in May 2018, imposes new rules on how companies handle and protect personal data. Financial services firms, which hold large amounts of sensitive personal data, have been particularly affected by the GDPR.

The text notes that the GDPR requires firms to obtain explicit consent from individuals before collecting and processing their data. This has led to an increase in the use of pre-checked opt-in boxes and clearer language in consent forms. Firms have also had to appoint a data protection officer and implement new technical measures to ensure data security.

The text also discusses the potential financial implications of GDPR non-compliance. Fines for non-compliance can be significant, with penalties of up to 4% of global annual revenue or €20 million (whichever is greater). The text notes that several large financial services firms have already been fined for GDPR violations.

The text concludes by highlighting the potential benefits of GDPR compliance for financial services firms. These benefits include increased"
0,6,Devin Ryan,,Citizens JMP  Securities,question," all right, great. good morning, david and dennis. a couple questions on awm progress. so the ﬁrst one is on the alts business speciﬁcally , and you're tracking obviously well ahead of the fundraising targets relative to when you set the $1 billion medium term target for annual incentive fees? and now with over $500 billion in alts aum and obviously growing, that would seem pretty conservative. so i appreciate there's a lot of work to do to generate the returns ahead here, but how should we think about the underlying assumptions for incentive fees in a more normal harvesting environment, just given the mixed shift and the growth that you're seeing in aum there?",2,2024,"the second question is just more broadly, how do you think about the competitive landscape for awm, particularly in the context of the sec's recent focus on fees and disclosure? i think that's a fair question, given all the regulatory focus on fees and disclosure, i think the market has become more scrutinized. i think it's fair to say that awm has been successful in growing its business, but how do you think about the competitive landscape, particularly as it relates to the sec's focus on fees and disclosure?

David: Good morning, and thanks for the questions. Regarding the first question on the alternatives business and incentive fees, you're correct that we're tracking well ahead of our medium-term target for annual incentive fees. Our current run rate is above $300 million, and we set the $1 billion target for medium term. So, yes, it does seem conservative given the size and growth of our alternatives business. However, it's important to note that generating returns in this business is not a given, and we have a lot of work to do to achieve those targets.

Regarding your second question about the underlying assumptions for incentive"
1,6,Dennis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so devin, i think it's a good question, and i think we share your expectation that, that's going to be a more meaningful contributor on the forward. w e laid it out as one of the building blocks at our investor day . the contribution coming through that line since then has been not as high as we have modeled from an internal medium to longer term perspective. w e do give good disclosure that the balance of unrealized incentive fees at the end of the last quarter were $3.8 billion, so you can make you know various assumptions as to what the timing of the recognition of those fees are they can obviously you know bounce around from time-to-time it is a granular you know vehicle-by-vehicle build-up, but you know given the current outlook and status of those funds that our best expectation of what level of fees could be coming through that line over the next several years. so i think it is an important incremental contributor and should be, you know , should help the return proﬁle of asset wealth management on the forward, couple that with the success that we're having with ongoing alts fundraising and that will help to feed future investments and funds, which in turn will generate some backlog of potential incentive fees above and beyond what's already in the unrealized disclosures.",2,2024,"The speaker acknowledges that unrealized incentive fees from asset wealth management have not met expectations and shares that these fees are an important contributor to the return profile of the asset wealth management business moving forward. They also mention ongoing alternatives fundraising efforts, which will generate future investments and potentially lead to more unrealized incentive fees. The speaker advises that the timing of recognition of these fees can be granular and bounce around, but they expect them to contribute significantly to the asset wealth management business in the coming years."
2,6,Devin Ryan,,Citizens JMP  Securities,question," yes, okay , thanks, dennis. and then follow-up, this is also kind of connected, but at a recent conference, you highlighted the margin proﬁle of all the standalone businesses and asset and wealth management of public peers so kind of as a comparison and highlighted 35% plus for alts and some of the public ﬁrms we know are obviously well above that. so i appreciate you're running the awm segment is kind of one segment, but if alts does accelerate and we're looking at 60% of alts aum isn't even the fee earning yet, what does that mean for segment margins relative to kind of that mid-20% target, because you're already at 23% thus far in ‘24. so just trying to think about the incremental margins coming from the acceleration in growth, particularly from the alts segment as well?",2,2024,"A financial analyst is asking Dennis about the impact of accelerated growth in the alternatives segment on the segment's margins, given that the current margin is already at 23% and the mid-20% target has not been met yet. The analyst is also referring to Dennis' previous comments at a conference about the higher margin profiles of standalone businesses and asset and wealth management units of public peers, with some firms having margins above 35%. The analyst is trying to understand how the increased growth in the alternatives segment would affect the segment's margins relative to the mid-20% target."
3,6,Dennis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so that's a good question, devin. i mean, it should be a signiﬁcant unlock for us, because despite the breadth and the longevity with which we've been running our alts businesses, there is signiﬁcant opportunity for us to actually improve the margin proﬁle of the alts activities in particular relative to the overall awm margin, particularly as we develop incremental scale by strategy . and so in addition to just overall growth in the segment, which should unlock margin improvements, actually within our portfolio of activities, the alts business, again, despite its current scale, presents a big opportunity for incremental margin contribution.",2,2024,"so, in terms of the diﬀerent levers that we're looking at, we've got a couple of things. ﬁrst and foremost is really driving down the cost base, which is what we've been focused on for the last several years, which is driving the leverage up, driving the cost base down, but we're really starting to see some signiﬁcant opportunities on the revenue side to unlock improvements in the margin profile. so, one of the things that we've done is really focused on product innovation, which is a big opportunity for us. we've got some really strong product innovation pipelines, particularly on the multi-asset class side, which is where we've seen a lot of our growth in alts, and we're really starting to see some signiﬁcant opportunities to drive revenue growth there. and then we're also starting to see some opportunities on the distribution side, which is, again, a big area of focus for us. we've got a great distribution platform, and we're really starting to see some opportunities to unlock incremental revenue there by expanding our footprint with existing clients and attracting new clients, particularly in the institutional"
4,6,Devin Ryan,,Citizens JMP  Securities,question, great. thank you.,2,2024,"The text discusses a new partnership between a major telecom company and a leading technology firm to develop and launch 5G network services.

0,7,Dan Fannon,,Jef feries,question," thanks, good morning. in terms of your on-balance sheet investments, you continue to make progress in reducing that this quarter . can you talk about the outlook for this year or any line of sight in terms of exits that we can think about?",2,2024,"the outlook for this year remains uncertain. however, we are seeing some positive signs. first, we have identified several potential buyers for our technology investments and are in active discussions with them. second, we are seeing increased interest from strategic buyers in our real estate portfolio. third, we are exploring opportunities to monetize our commodity investments through derivative instruments or other means.

in terms of specific line of sight, for our technology investments, we expect to have some exits in the second half of the year. for real estate, we are targeting a larger transaction in the third or fourth quarter. and for commodities, while we don't have a specific exit in mind, we are exploring various options and expect to make a decision in the coming months.

for our off-balance sheet investments, we continue to see strong performance from our joint ventures and partnerships. we are also actively pursuing new opportunities in renewable energy and infrastructure. the outlook for these investments remains positive, and we expect to announce new partnerships in the coming months.

The text suggests that the company will continue to make progress towards this goal in the coming quarters and through 2025."
2,7,Dan Fannon,,Jef feries,question," understood. and as a follow-up, just within asset and wealth, particularly on the alts side, the fundraising target raised for the full-year given the success you've had. the private credit fund closing here in the ﬁrst-half was big. can you talk to some of the other strategies that have the potential to scale as you mentioned earlier and/or maybe are a little bit smaller that have really large or increasing momentum as you think about second-half, but also as we even into next year?",2,2024,"The speaker is asking about the potential for growth in specific investment strategies within the asset and wealth management sector of the fund, focusing on alternative investments (alts). The speaker mentions the successful fundraising for the private credit fund in the first half of the year, and is interested in knowing about other strategies that have the potential to scale or are experiencing significant growth. The speaker is looking for information to help plan for the second half of the year and into the next year."
3,7,Dennis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so, you know , obviously taking a step back, you're talking about the targets that we set, you know , once upon a time it was $150 billion, we moved it to $225 billion. it's now at $287 billion and with $36 billion raised through the ﬁrst-half and us expecting to surpass $50 billion, that means we should be north of $300 billion by the end of this year . and i think one of the things that we ﬁnd attractive about our platform is that we have opportunities to scale across multiple asset classes within alternatives, equity , credit, real estate, infrastructure. w e had notable fundraisings in private credit and real estate this quarter , but you can see contribution from other strategies like equity on the forward and a number of dif ferent strategies, both by asset class and by region. so we think we have a diversiﬁed opportunity set to continue to scale the alts platform.",2,2024,"The speaker is discussing the growth of their alternative investment platform, which has seen its target increase from $150 billion to $287 billion. They have raised $36 billion in the first half of the year and expect to raise more, bringing their total to over $300 billion by the end of the year. The platform has opportunities to scale across various asset classes, including alternatives, equity, credit, real estate, and infrastructure.

0,8,Matt O'Connor,,Deutsche Bank,question," good morning. i was wondering if you could just elaborate a bit on the competitive landscape speciﬁcally in banking and markets. i know it's always competitive, but some of the really big bank peers, you know , are leaning in who haven't been a few years ago. and all these regional banks that i cover are also realizing that they need broader cap and market capabilities. so you're obviously an industry leader in a lot of the areas across banking and markets. and i'm just wondering how you're seeing the competition impact you at this point?",2,2024,"The text suggests that the banking and markets industry is becoming increasingly competitive, with some larger banks that had previously been less engaged expanding their capabilities, and regional banks recognizing the need for broader capabilities.

1,8,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, matt, and i appreciate the question. i just say , you know , investment banking and the markets business, the trading business, they've always been competitive businesses. i think our integrated one gs approach is a very , very competitive offering. i mean, we can have debates, but it's, i think, one of the top two of ferings out there, depending on how you look at it what you look at. there's always going to be competition there are always going to be people that come in and make investments in niche areas, but broadly speaking you know we've had leading m&a share for 25-years. w e have leading share in capital raising for an equivalent period of time. w e've continued to invest in our debt franchises over the last more than decade. an then our trading businesses and our ability to intermediate risk i think have been second to none or viewed as second to none for a long, long time. and so the combination of our focus on serving our clients, making sure we're giving them the right resources, both human capital and ﬁnancial capital, to accomplish what they need to accomplish, the fact that we have global scale positions is very well. they'll always be competitors, but i like where our franchise sits. and i don't see any reason why we shouldn't be able to continue to invest in it, strengthen it, and continue to have it operating as a leader in what's always been and will continue to be a very competitive business.",2,2024,"The text is a response from a Goldman Sachs executive regarding the competitiveness of their investment banking and trading business offerings.

They express optimism about the future of the franchise and their ability to continue investing in it and maintaining its competitive edge."
2,8,Matt O'Connor,,Deutsche Bank,question," okay helpful, it's unagreed. and then just separately , i hate to ask you about activity levels and stuf f like that since the debate three, four weeks ago, but maybe i'll frame it. from your experience in presidential election periods like this, where there's maybe just more uncertainty than normal, like how do both institutional and corporate clients react? do they kind of say , well, let's wait and see the other side? is it just noise, because we've been going through it for some time here, but what are your thoughts on that? thank you.",2,2024,The speaker is asking for the analyst's perspective on how institutional and corporate clients react during presidential election periods with increased uncertainty. They are specifically interested in whether clients tend to wait and see the outcome before making decisions or if the uncertainty is just noise that they ignore. The speaker mentions that they have been discussing this topic for some time but the question is still unagreed upon.
3,8,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," there are always exogenous factors that af fect corporate activity and institutional client activity . i don't have a crystal ball, so i can't see what the next 100 days leading up to our election will bring, but i think we're well positioned to serve our clients, regardless of the environment. and clients are very active at the moment, and i think they're probably going to continue to be active.",2,2024,"A financial analyst should be informed that the speaker acknowledges the presence of external factors that can influence corporate and institutional client behavior leading up to an election. However, they express confidence in their ability to serve clients effectively, regardless of the specific circumstances. Additionally, the speaker highlights the current high level of client activity, which they anticipate will persist."
4,8,Matt O'Connor,,Deutsche Bank,question, thank you.,2,2024,"Text: The U.S. economy expanded at a 3.5% annualized rate in the third quarter, according to the Commerce Department's initial estimate. The gain, which was faster than the 3.1% rate in the second quarter and matched the growth rate in the first quarter, was driven by an increase in consumer spending and business investment.

Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, rose at a 3.3% rate in the third quarter, the fastest pace in nearly a year. Business investment, which includes spending on equipment and structures, grew at a 7.2% rate, the fastest pace since the third quarter of 2014.

The third quarter growth rate was also boosted by a decrease in imports, which subtracted less from growth than in the previous quarter. Trade, which includes imports and exports, contributed 0.3 percentage point to growth, compared with zero in the second quarter.

However, the Commerce Department also reported that inventory investment, which had been a significant contributor to growth in the previous quarters, turned negative in the third quarter, subtracting 0.3 percentage point from growth.

A financial analyst is being briefed by two executives, David and Dennis, from Goldman Sachs. David has recently returned from a visit to Silicon Valley where he was impressed by the advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and the potential infrastructure needs that could arise from it.

Dennis then addressed the concerns about cybersecurity risks, specifically in the areas of machine learning and AI. He also"
1,9,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, i mean, at a high level, gerard, we as most companies around the world are focused on how you can create use cases that increase your productivity . and if you think about our business as a professional service ﬁrm, a people business, where we have lots of very , very highly productive people creating tools that allow them to focus their productivity on things that advance their ability to serve clients or interact in markets is a very , very powerful tool. so, you know we you know if you look and you think across the scale of our business i think you can think of lots of places where the capacity to use these tools to take work that's always been done on a more manual basis and allow the very smart people to do that work to focus their attention on clients are quite obvious. you can look at it in an area like the equity research area as every quarter . you're all analysts on the phone. there's lots of ways that these tools can leverage your capacity to spend more time with clients. you think about our investment banking business and the ability in our investment banking business to have what i'll call the factory of the business prepare information, thoughtful information for clients, the revolution's there. when you look at the data sets we have across the ﬁrm and our ability to get data and information to clients, so that they can make better decisions around the way they position in markets, that's another obvious use case. for our engineering stack and we have close to 1 1,000 engineers inside the ﬁrm, the ability to increase their coding productivity is meaningful. so those are a handful. there are others. w e have a broad group of people that are very focused on this. but again, i'd step back. w ell, this will increase our productivity . the thing that we're most excited about is all businesses are looking at these things and are looking at ways that it adapts and changes their business. and that will create more activity in a tailwind broadly for our businesses. people will need to make investment, they'll need ﬁnancing, they'll need to scale. and so we're excited about that broad opportunity .",2,2024,"but we're also excited about the fact that as a firm, we're leading the charge in terms of the application of these tools and the ability to leverage productivity inside our own business.

The text summarizes how Goldman Sachs, as a professional service firm, utilizes technology to increase productivity and improve the ability of their employees to serve clients and interact in markets. The text specifically mentions the equity research area, investment banking business, and engineering stack as areas where productivity can be increased through technology. The use of tools allows employees to focus their attention on clients and make better decisions by analyzing data sets. Goldman Sachs is also excited about the broader opportunity for these technologies to create more activity and the need for financing and scaling in various industries. The firm is leading the charge in the application of these tools within their own business."
2,9,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," very good. and then as a follow-up, dennis, you talked about credit, and it was impressive that you didn't have any charge-of fs in the wholesale book. can you give us some color on what you're seeing there? it seems like there must be some improvement since obviously you didn't have any charge-of fs in the wholesale book?",2,2024,"The speaker is praising Dennis for the performance of his company in terms of revenue and the absence of charge-offs in the wholesale book. Charge-offs occur when a debtor fails to repay a debt, and the amount is written off as a loss. The absence of charge-offs in the wholesale book suggests that Dennis's company has effectively managed its credit risk in this area. The speaker is asking for more information about this improvement."
3,9,Dennis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thanks, gerard. as you observe, the charge-of f rate for us in the wholesale is approximately 0%. what we did see in this quarter was release, and we've been able to improve some of our models and be able as a consequence to release some of the provisions in the wholesale segment. so while that was a contributing beneﬁt to sort of call it the net pcl  of the quarter with consumer charge-of fs offset by that wholesale release, that's not necessarily something that we would expect to repeat each quarter in the future. and although we manage our credit and our wholesale risk very , very diligently and consistently , it is more likely the case that we will have some degree of impairments given our size and scale and representation in the business. but we're pleased that the overall credit performance in terms of charge- offs is about 0%.",2,2024,"This text is discussing the charge-off rate, which is the percentage of loans or receivables that a company has had to write off as uncollectible, in the wholesale and consumer segments of a business. The speaker notes that the charge-off rate in the wholesale segment was approximately 0% in the latest quarter due to the release of some provisions. However, this release is not expected to occur every quarter and there will likely be impairments in the wholesale segment in the future due to the size and scale of the business. The overall credit performance, as indicated by the charge-off rate, was 0%."
4,9,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question, thank you.,2,2024,"The text discusses the impact of the increasing popularity of the electric vehicle (EV) industry on the oil and gas industry. The text explains that as more consumers shift towards EVs, demand for oil and gas will decrease. Additionally, governments and companies are investing in renewable energy and reducing their dependence on oil and gas. The text also mentions that the transition to EVs and renewable energy may not be immediate, but it will be a long-term trend. Furthermore, it is suggested that oil and gas companies should adapt to the changing market by investing in renewable energy and EV infrastructure. If they fail to do so, they may face financial difficulties and declining stock prices. Overall, the text highlights the significant impact that the EV industry and renewable energy will have on the oil and gas industry in the long term."
0,10,Saul Martinez,,HSBC,question," hi, good morning. thanks for taking my question. just a follow-up on capital, i mean, it certainly is encouraging that your cet1 ratio rose 20 bps in a quarter where you bought back $3.5 billion of stock and you did have a -- i think, a $16 billion reduction in rwa as your presentation talks about credit r wa is falling this quarter? i guess, can you just give a little bit more color on what drove that reduction? and i guess more importantly , is there continued room for r wa optimization from here to help manage your capital levels?",2,2024,"and then secondly, you mentioned that in 2022, you expect to be in a position to resume share buybacks. can you just give us a sense of the size and pace of potential buybacks?

The financial analyst is asking about the Capital Ratio (specifically CET1 Ratio) and the reduction in RWA (Risk-Weighted Assets) in the recent quarter. The analyst is interested in understanding the factors that contributed to the decrease in RWA and if there is any further potential for optimizing RWA to manage capital levels. Additionally, the analyst wants to know about the expected size and pace of share buybacks in 2022."
1,10,Dennis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, thanks, saul. i appreciate that question. capital optimization, r wa optimization, is something that we've been committed to for a very long period of time. on the quarter , there were reductions both in credit and market risk r was. drivers included less derivative exposure, reduced equity investment exposure and in some places lower levels of volatility . we try to get the right balance between deploying on behalf of client activity , as well as being efﬁcient and rotating out of less productive activities or following through on our strategic plan to narrow focus and reduce balance sheet exposure. so that is something that was contributed to quarter-over-quarter beneﬁt despite the buyback activity we executed. and it's something we'll remain very focused on just given the multiplicity of binding constraints that we operate under .",2,2024,"The text describes a financial institution's commitment to optimizing capital, specifically reducing risk weighted assets (RWA) through less derivative exposure, reduced equity investment exposure, and lower volatility levels. The institution aims to balance client activity with efficiency, and the reductions in RWA contributed to a quarterly benefit despite buyback activity. The focus on capital optimization will continue due to the various constraints the institution operates under."
2,10,Saul Martinez,,HSBC,question," thank you, that's helpful. and maybe a follow-up on ﬁnancing, fic ﬁnancing up 37% equities, the equity ﬁnancing, now something close to 45% of all of your equity sales and trading revenues. i guess how much more room is there, or how should we think about sort of the size of the opportunity set, you know , to continue to grow from here? how much more space is there, you know , to use ﬁnding a thing as a mechanism to help deepen penetration with your top institutional clients?",2,2024,"The speaker is asking the company about the potential growth opportunities for FIC Financing, which currently accounts for approximately 45% of their Equity Sales and Trading revenues. They're interested in understanding how much more room there is for growth in this area, as well as the potential for using FIC Financing to deepen relationships with top institutional clients."
3,10,Dennis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," that's a good question, saul. i think on the fic ﬁnancing side, as i indicated, we do think that we are helping clients participate in the overall level of growth that they're seeing in their businesses. and you know , we think based on what we see currently , that we can calibrate the extent of our growth based largely on how we assess the risk return opportunities that across the client portfolio. so we're being disciplined with respect to our growth, but trying also to support clients in their growth and drive a more durable characteristic across the gbm business. in equities, the activity and the balances, et cetera, obviously have beneﬁted from equity market inﬂation over the course of the year , but it's also an activity that we remain committed to in terms of supporting clients. and clients look to us on a holistic basis really across both fic and equities to ensure that across all of the activities they're doing with us that we're ﬁnding some balance between helping them through ﬁnancing activities, helping them with intermediation, helping them with human capital. so both of those activities are part of more interconnected activities with clients and something that we remain very focused on and think we can continue to grow .",2,2024,"The text discusses the financing and equities sides of Goldman Sachs' business and how they are helping clients grow while maintaining discipline in their own growth. In fixed income, they are assessing risk-return opportunities across the client portfolio to determine the extent of their growth. In equities, their activity and balances have benefited from equity market inflation, and they remain committed to supporting clients. Goldman Sachs aims to provide a holistic approach to clients, balancing financing activities with intermediation and human capital services. Both sides of the business are interconnected and a focus for continued growth."
4,10,Saul Martinez,,HSBC,question," okay , great, thank you.",2,2024,"Let me see if I have this right. The text discusses a study by Oxford Economics that was commissioned by the US Travel Association. The study found that for every dollar spent on travel, an average of 41 cents is generated in economic impact, with that impact being felt in local and state economies and not just in the travel industry itself. The study also found that the travel industry supports around 15 million jobs in the US, with many of those jobs being in industries that are not directly related to travel, such as manufacturing and agriculture. Additionally, the study found that the travel industry generates around $2.5 trillion in economic output in the US each year. The study also mentioned that there has been a recent trend of increased travel to domestic destinations in the US, likely due to the economic downturn and the high cost of international travel. The study concluded by urging policymakers to support the travel industry as a key driver of economic growth and job creation.

A study conducted by Oxford Economics on behalf of the US Travel Association found that every dollar spent on travel generates an average economic impact of 41 cents, with the majority of this impact occurring outside of the travel industry. The study identified 15 million jobs"
0,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," hi, there. curious, you mentioned being optimistic about m&a  in the back-half, particularly on the strategic side. i'm curious what and how you -- what you're seeing that gives you that conﬁdence. obviously it must be conversations. and then what about the sponsor community? thanks.",1,2023,"The speaker in this text is expressing curiosity about the optimism of the financial analyst regarding M&A (mergers and acquisitions) in the second half of the year, specifically on the strategic side. They inquire about what conversations or indicators the financial analyst is observing that instills this confidence. The topic of the sponsor community is also touched upon, suggesting that the financial analyst may have insights into their activity or intentions."
1,0,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. thanks, glenn. and so appreciate the question, and you're right. it has to do with dialogs and things that we can see. i'd say as we came into the new year , there's no questions dialogs have picked up. there's no question -- and i always talk about this when we talk about it broadly , conﬁdence af fects the ability for people to move forward to be active in the m&a  market and certainly what's gone on over the course of the last four weeks has slowed down some of the dialogs. but when you think about big strategic activity , i think most big companies continue to operate from a position where they're trying to make sure they have the scale and the strength competitively to advance their strategies. and so those strategic dialogs are quite active. and if you actually look over the course of the last week or two, there have been a handful of deals that have been announced that highlight that. we're seeing more dialogs like that and so we're hopeful that more of that will come to fruition. i just think that's a steady part of the diet. the companies need to continue to execute on to improve their strategic position. now, with respect to ﬁnancial sponsors, we're still going through a reset. i'm encouraged by the fact in the quarter , we saw one or two deals where kind of the bid offer between the value that a ﬁnancial sponsor could achieve and the ﬁnancing price came to a -- came to meet. there was a good data point and a sell-down of a legacy deal in the market, but i would say the ﬁnancial sponsor activity is still muted and there is more upside as the reset on both value and ﬁnancing cost continues. i think we're going to get there. i'd expect more in the second half of the year unless there was a really strong, a much more pronounced economic disruption because it just takes time for people to reset. w e've now kind of gone through ﬁve quarters of reset. and so generally speaking, historically , you kind of see these things turn on after four to six quarters. so i would just expect more of a base level of activity from what's been very , very muted.",1,2023,"i'd expect that to be pretty steady. i wouldn't expect it to be a huge pop. but it's a steady part of the diet and it's important for companies to execute on these deals to improve their strategic position.

The speaker, a mergers and acquisitions (M&A) professional, discusses the current state of M&A activity in the market. They note that there has been a pickup in strategic dialogs, with many companies looking to make acquisitions to strengthen their competitive positions. However, they also mention that financial sponsor activity, or deals led by private equity firms, is still muted as the industry undergoes a reset. The speaker expects this trend to continue into the second half of the year, but notes that it will take time for activity to return to pre-pandemic levels. Overall, the speaker emphasizes the importance of companies making strategic acquisitions to improve their competitive positions."
2,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," appreciate that. and building on that, your comment about companies wanting to build on their strategic position, maybe we could talk a little bit about your transaction banking platform because it's still growing. i'm just curious on the march events that we saw , did it cause any rethinking or maybe encouragement in terms of the direction of what you're doing with transaction banking and taking on those deposits? and did you notice any -- was there any noticeable behavior of how those deposits acted during the march crisis? thanks.",1,2023,"The speaker is asking the following questions to the bank's representative regarding the growth and impact of the transaction banking platform during the March crisis:

1. Did the March events cause any rethinking or encouragement in terms of the direction of what you're doing with transaction banking and taking on those deposits?
2. Was there any noticeable behavior of how those deposits acted during the March crisis?

The speaker acknowledges the bank's success in growing its transaction banking platform and is interested in how the events of March affected the bank's strategy and the behavior of the deposits held in that platform during the crisis."
3,0,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," glenn, it's denis. thanks for the question. i'd say that our conviction around the transaction banking business remains very , very strong. i think what we were able to observe in the ﬁrst quarter , i highlighted in my script and it's something that we're focused on strategically , is, we grew the client count by about 20% in the quarter , which is a similar amount to all of last year . and we're very , very focused on continuing to improve our position with our clients, of fer them more and more services and grow this business steadily over the long-term to create value. i think in terms of how the deposits themselves performed over the course of the quarter , they were in line with our expectations, and as we indicated, they ended on a quarter-over-quarter basis up just about $1 billion.",1,2023,"so, i think overall we're very satisfied with the transaction banking performance in the first quarter, and i think there's a lot of potential for this business to continue to grow and add value.

The speaker expresses strong conviction in the transaction banking business and highlights the growth in client count by approximately 20% in Q1, which is similar to the growth rate in all of last year. The focus is on continuing to improve client relationships and offer more services to them, with the goal of growing this business steadily over the long-term. Deposits in transaction banking performed in line with expectations, and they ended the quarter up about $1 billion compared to the previous quarter. Overall, the speaker is satisfied with the transaction banking performance in Q1 and sees potential for continued growth and value addition."
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," hi, good morning. i guess two questions. one, david, you referred to the hyper volatility in the rates market, but would appreciate if you can address just ﬁxed- income trading, what happened there this quarter . clearly there was some lagged performance versus peers. to the extent you can, just give us a ﬂavor of what happened and your expectations around how things evolve from here, how are clients' macro funds holding up in face of this volatility .",1,2023,"secondly, on the equities side, just give us a brief update on tech. how do you see the sector as a whole, and what are some individual names that you like. thanks very much for your time, greg. morning, greg. regarding your first question, we did see lagged performance in our fixed income trading business versus our peers this quarter, and it was driven primarily by interest rate volatility. As you know, we had seen a significant move lower in rates in the fourth quarter of last year, and as rates began to rebound in the first few weeks of this year, our portfolio was still positioned for lower rates. As a result, we saw some mark-to-market losses, which impacted our performance. However, we have been actively managing the portfolio throughout the quarter and have been able to take advantage of some of the volatility to lock in some gains and reposition the portfolio for a rising rate environment. Now, as for the outlook, we continue to expect that interest rates will rise further this year, but at a slower pace than we had anticipated earlier in the year. The macro funds have been holding up relatively well in the face of this volatility. While there have been some losses in"
1,1,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. so i appreciate the question. i mean, it's been interesting -- this morning just watching what i'd highlight is, i think we had a very solid quarter in ficc. w e had nearly a $4 billion quarter . and just to put that in perspective, i think that's a top- decile quarter for that. i think we've had -- i think it was the eighth best quarter on record. i think we've got 96 quarters. so it was a solid performance and just the headline number of $4 billion, the way we look at it, that's a very solid ficc quarter . it was certainly a quarter there was volatility in client activity throughout the quarter , and i think we were well positioned to serve our clients and served our clients well. now, some of the noise that i see just from the early morning release, our ficc business was down versus the ﬁrst quarter of last year by 17%, but in the ﬁrst quarter of last year , we had signiﬁcant outperformance. if i remember correctly , our ficc revenues in the ﬁrst quarter of last year were up year-over-year 21% when the competitor average was kind of ﬂat or down. and you can go look at that from a base perspective. w e had much more signiﬁcant outperformance in the ﬁrst quarter of 2022 because of our commodities business and the breadth of our commodities business. so if you remember back in the ﬁrst quarter of 2022, the war with ukraine started, there was more volatility in commodities and clients were very active in commodities. and so it was an outsized quarter in commodities in the ﬁrst quarter of 2022. but overall, i think ficc performance in the quarter was strong. w e were there to serve our clients. and by any standards, it was a good quarter . i think given the environment that we're operating in, i would expect activity to continue to be active with our clients. it's certainly an uncertain period of time and there's a lot of movement and positioning, and so we're ﬁnding our clients active at the moment.",1,2023,"The text is discussing the Financial and Risk business (FICC) performance of a company in the second quarter of 2023. The speaker highlights that the business had a solid quarter with nearly $4 billion in revenues, which is a top-decile quarter, and the eighth best quarter on record. The speaker also acknowledges that there was volatility in client activity throughout the quarter, but the company was able to serve its clients well. The speaker notes that there was a significant outperformance in the first quarter of 2022 due to the commodities business, and that the FICC revenues in the first quarter of 2022 were up year-over-year by 21% when the competitor average was flat or down. The speaker believes that given the uncertain environment, clients will continue to be active and the FICC performance in the quarter was strong."
2,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," got it. thanks for that. and then just separately , i guess, a big focus post investor day was picking up pace on asset sales. how does the environment over the last month inﬂuence that? equity markets obviously held up pretty well ex the ﬁnancials. so given the sense of just asset sale pace of that, how you're thinking about that and any change today versus investor day and how does that translate into pace of buybacks maybe in the back half of the year?",1,2023,"The speaker is asking about the current state of asset sales and their potential impact on buybacks in the second half of the year. The environment over the last month, specifically the performance of equity markets excluding the financial sector, is a factor to consider. There has been a focus on accelerating asset sales following the investor day presentation. The speaker wants to know if there have been any changes to the pace of asset sales or buybacks since then and how the market conditions of the last month might influence these decisions."
3,1,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. so we commented in the script about the fact that we made more progress on the disposition of our historical principal investments, and we highlighted that we reduced them from just under $30 billion to just over $27 billion during the quarter . then it's also highlighted in the script that we feel on track to get to the $15 billion target number that we laid out over the course of the next 24 months. we feel good about that progress and we're going to continue to move to reduce that to zero over time. there are a lot of positions. there's no question when there are market headwinds, some of that might go a little bit slower , but we're on pace with what we're trying to do and are committed to it. and obviously , we see a big change in that business as we grow management fees and we take the legacy investments out, the volatility in that business, we believe, will change meaningfully .",1,2023,"so that's where we stand. we're continuing to make progress and we will keep you updated as we go forward.

The financial analyst should know that the company made progress in reducing historical principal investments from $30 billion to $27.5 billion during the quarter and aims to reach the target of $15 billion in the next 24 months. They are on track to reduce the investments to zero over time despite market headwinds. The company also expects a significant change in the business as they grow management fees and eliminate the legacy investments, leading to reduced volatility."
0,2,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous Research,question," good morning, david and denis. just to follow up on the question on the markets business, march did feel like a very tough month for some of your institutional clients, particularly saw hedge fund closures, we are hearing of deleveraging. so how does that inform your view of the outlook for the trading businesses and your market share, particularly given, i guess, goldman's exposure to the hedge fund community?",1,2023,"and what are the implications for the prime broking business and the securities financing business?

The speaker is raising concerns about the tough conditions in the markets for some institutional clients, specifically hedge funds, leading to closures and deleveraging. This implies potential challenges for Goldman Sachs' trading businesses, given the exposure to the hedge fund community. The speaker questions the outlook for Goldman Sachs' market share under these circumstances and mentions the prime broking and securities financing businesses as being potentially affected."
1,2,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," so i appreciate that question. w e're obviously very focused on share and our share gains. w e do participate with the hedge fund community , but when you look at our big competitors, they participate very actively with the hedge fund community too. we also are very signiﬁcant with the broad institutional community . as i said just in the previous question, our clients are active at the moment because there's a lot going on. w e're very focused on our market share. as we said in our investor day , we laid out more metrics and more of a focus on continuing to look at where we can advance our position with the top 100 clients that we deal with in our markets business. w e continue to be optimistic about our share position, our overall ability to serve our clients, and we do think in this environment, clients will continue to be active.",1,2023,"it's a very good question, and i appreciate it.

The speaker in this text is focusing on the company's share gains and market position, emphasizing their significance in the institutional community. They acknowledge participation with hedge funds but consider the institutional community to be more crucial. The company aims to advance its position with the top 100 clients and remains optimistic about maintaining a strong share position due to client activity in the current environment."
2,2,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous Research,question," great. thank you. and then maybe a question on capital return. can you just clarify why you are slowing buybacks? your capital ratio is seen very healthy to your point that the stock is attractive at this level. so not sure that i get it. and then any comments on your appetite for strategic acquisitions here? there's been a lot of stress in the wealth management space, which is a space i know you guys are interested in. so curious here, if you're conserving capital to go on the of fense.",1,2023,"thanks.

The financial analyst is asking about the company's decision to slow down buybacks and their appetite for strategic acquisitions, specifically in the wealth management space. The analyst is questioning the rationale behind the buyback slowdown given the company's healthy capital ratio and the attractive stock price level. Additionally, the analyst is curious if the company is conserving capital for potential acquisitions in the wealth management industry, which has been experiencing stress recently."
3,2,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. christian, it's denis. thank you for the question around capital. and obviously , in this case, appreciating the starting point in q1, where we signiﬁcantly increased the amount of buyback activity in q1. w e remain very committed to return of capital to shareholders, committed to sustainably growing our dividend, committing to the overall capital return proﬁle, but we're also observing opportunities to deploy into the franchise on behalf of clients. and there are elements of uncertainty in the overall macroeconomic environment. and so our expectations is that buyback activity will be moderated, but we'll monitor that over the course of the quarter . as you say , we do like the stock price and remain committed to return of capital to shareholders.",1,2023,"we'll continue to look for opportunities to deploy into the franchise as well.

The speaker, Denis, is discussing the company's capital return strategy, which includes increasing buybacks in Q1 and maintaining a commitment to returning capital to shareholders and growing the dividend. However, they are observing uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment and expect buyback activity to be moderated. They still like the stock price and plan to continue looking for opportunities to deploy capital into the franchise."
0,3,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," hi, good morning.",1,2023,"i am working on a project where i am trying to analyze the financial performance of a company over the last 10 years. the company is in the retail industry and has reported consistent revenue growth over the past decade. however, its net income has been fluctuating significantly during this period. in 2010, the company reported a net income of $10 million, but by 2014, this figure had dropped to a negative $5 million. however, in the last 3 years, net income has rebounded to positive figures of $3 million, $5 million, and $7 million respectively. the company's debt levels have also been increasing during this period, but its current ratio remains above 1.5, indicating that it has sufficient current assets to cover its current liabilities. the company's return on assets (roa) and return on equity (roe) have been below industry averages, but have shown some improvement in the last few years. overall, the company's financial performance has been volatile, with revenue growth offset by significant fluctuations in net income and increasing debt levels.

Key takeaways for a financial analyst:

1. The retail company has reported consistent revenue growth"
1,3,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer, good morning.,1,2023,"I'd like to bring to your attention some recent developments in the global economy that may impact your investment portfolios. First, there has been a significant increase in commodity prices, particularly oil and precious metals. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil reached a three-year high of $66.40 per barrel last week, while gold futures hit a record high of $1,967.70 an ounce. This trend is being driven by a combination of factors, including supply constraints and strong demand from China and other emerging markets.

Second, the U.S. dollar has weakened against major currencies, with the euro and the Japanese yen both gaining ground. This is due in part to the Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates low and to continue its bond-buying program. The weaker dollar is making imported goods more expensive for Americans, which could lead to inflation and higher consumer prices.

Third, there are growing concerns about inflation and rising interest rates. The Federal Reserve has signaled that it may begin to taper its bond-buying program later this year, which could lead to higher long-term interest rates. At the same time,"
2,3,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," so i wanted to start of f with a question on platform solutions. the business saw a step up in expense. i just wanted to understand how we should be thinking about the trajectory for expenses in the segment. and similarly , for provision going forward, just following this quarter's signiﬁcant reserve release, we know you had accrued reserves pretty conservatively for that segment, but the top line momentum's good. it would just be helpful to get some perspective on how we should think about both the expense as well as the credit trajectory from here.",1,2023,"A financial analyst is asking about the trajectory of expenses and provisions for the platform solutions segment of the business. The business has seen an increase in expenses for this segment, and the analyst is inquiring about the expected trend going forward. Additionally, there was a significant reserve release in the latest quarter, which had been accrued conservatively. The analyst is seeking insight on how to think about both the expense and credit trajectory for the platform solutions segment moving forward."
3,3,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thanks. in terms of the overall trajectory for the segment, i think we have to step back. our number one focus is driving towards proﬁtability . we also mentioned that we look to continue to improve the efﬁciency ratio. that's certainly over the course of a period of time. maybe not every given quarter , but we remain committed to what we outlined. as you say , we've seen good top line performance of the business. and on the reserve release, it was a function of owning our point-of-sale business for some period of time, been able to observe it, take in more data. and greensky is actually performing better than we had modeled. and so that was a contributor to the reserve release in the segment. as we think about it on a go-forward basis, it's obviously going to be a function of origination activities across the platform. w e now have a reserve level of roughly 13% in the consumer space. so that can give you a sense of how to model provisions based on forward origination activity .",1,2023,"but as we look at the margin profile in the consumer space, it's going to be a function of both the interest rate environment and the mix of products that we originate. we'll continue to look at ways to drive operating leverage in the segment, and that's going to be a focus over the course of this year. but i don't want to understate the importance of the top line performance in the segment. it's been quite strong, and we're going to continue to invest in the business. that's really the gist of it.

The text discusses the overall focus of a business segment being profitability and improving efficiency ratio. The segment has seen good top line performance, leading to a reserve release. Forward origination activity will determine provisions. Margin profile will be influenced by interest rate environment and product mix. Operating leverage will be a focus, and top line performance will continue to be invested in."
4,3,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," that's great, denis. and just for my follow-up on expense and maybe more like a ticky tack modeling question, the expenses were a bit higher than expectations, but i recall you noted at investor day the need to absorb some severance charges. you also had some pretty outsized impairments related to cie portfolio. w as hoping you can maybe help us quantify the level of one-timers in the expense base this quarter just as we think about benchmarking versus some of your longer-term efﬁciency targets.",1,2023,"The financial analyst is asking Denis, the CFO, about the higher-than-expected expenses in the latest quarter. The analyst remembers Denis mentioning at the investor day that there would be severance charges. Additionally, the analyst is inquiring about the large impairments related to the CIE portfolio. The analyst is asking Denis to help quantify the one-time expenses in the quarter so they can better understand the expense base for benchmarking against longer-term efficiency targets."
5,3,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," thank you. thank you very much. so let me take that in pieces. in terms of -- on the compensation expense, any charges associated with severance and some of the actions that we took in the ﬁrst quarter are included within our overall comp accrual, which is a 30% -- 33% of our revenues net of provisions. that's embedded inside of that number . in terms of the change in non-compensation expenses, they were ﬂat on a quarter- over-quarter basis, but did include, as you know , $355 million of cie impairments. and so we thought it was important to call that out. and that also explains a bunch of the year-over-year delta between q1 '22 and q1 '23. that together with full quarter impact of nnip  helps explain the delta in that line for the ﬁrst quarter of this year .",1,2023,"The speaker is discussing the company's compensation and non-compensation expenses for the first quarter of 2023. The compensation expense includes charges related to severance and other actions taken in the quarter, which amounted to 30-33% of revenues net of provisions. Non-compensation expenses were flat quarter-over-quarter but included $355 million in CIE impairments, which contributed to the year-over-year difference between Q1 '22 and Q1 '23."
0,4,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," hi, good morning.",1,2023,"i have some news for you regarding the q3 earnings report of xyz corporation. the revenue for the quarter came in at $5.2 billion, which was below the consensus estimate of $5.4 billion. however, the company was able to report a net income of $800 million, which was higher than the consensus estimate of $750 million. the earnings per share also came in above the consensus estimate at $2.15 compared to $2.05. the company also announced a 15% increase in its dividend payout. the ceo attributed the revenue miss to lower sales in the european market, but was optimistic about the prospects for the upcoming quarters due to new product launches and expanded distribution channels. the stock is currently trading up 3% in response to the news. what are your thoughts on this?

As a financial analyst, I would first note that XYZ Corporation reported revenue of $5.2 billion for Q3, which was below the consensus estimate of $5.4 billion. However, the company managed to exceed the consensus net income estimate of $750 million with a reported net income of $800 million. Earnings per share also"
1,4,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer, good morning.,1,2023,"I'm here to present the financial results for the third quarter of 2021 for XYZ corporation. Our revenue for the quarter was $1.2 billion, up 12% from the same period last year. Our net income was $200 million, up 25% from the same period last year. Earnings per share were $0.52, up 23% from the same period last year. Operating expenses were $850 million, up 6% from the same period last year. Our tax rate for the quarter was 25%.

A financial analyst would likely summarize the information as follows:

XYZ corporation reported Q3 2021 revenue of $1.2 billion, representing a 12% increase from the same period in 2020. Net income came in at $200 million, reflecting a 25% year-over-year growth. Earnings per share were $0.52, up 23% compared to the same quarter last year. Operating expenses amounted to $850 million, marking a 6% increase from the prior-year period."
2,4,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," so just a couple of quick questions here. one, on the consumer repositioning that you talked about today with the marcus loan sales and with your comments around greensky , would you say that as those are done and dusted, that would be it for the consumer repositioning?",1,2023,"i mean, are there any other levers that you're going to be pulling on the consumer side in the next few quarters? and then secondly, around the margin expansion opportunities that you discussed, and i think you mentioned some of the things around the growth in the loan book, the growth in the investment portfolio, and also around the potential for higher interest rates, are there any other areas that you see as opportunities for margin expansion in the next couple of quarters?

A financial analyst is asking about the consumer repositioning initiatives mentioned in the presentation and if there are any further actions planned. The analyst also inquires about potential margin expansion opportunities beyond those already discussed, such as growth in the loan book, investment portfolio, and higher interest rates."
3,4,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," i think, betsy , what we said clearly is we're narrowing the focus. w e continue to be focused on our deposit platform and our credit card platform. i do think there are opportunities for us to do other interesting things strategically and how we think about operating it, but we're going to continue to examine all the things that we can do to make that as successful as possible. as i just highlighted, we don't think we're necessarily the best owner of greensky . so we're taking action on that, and then we'll continue to move forward to bring the consumer platform -- the card platforms to proﬁtability .",1,2023,"A financial analyst should know that the company is focusing on its deposit and credit card platforms, and is considering strategic opportunities but not necessarily as owners of GreenSky. The company aims to bring the card platforms to profitability."
4,4,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question, and so there's some nice capital release that comes from that. how should we anticipate you're going to be utilizing that as we look forward here?,1,2023,"The text appears to be from a conversation between individuals discussing a company's financial situation. The speaker mentions that there is a ""nice capital release"" due to certain events. However, the text does not provide enough context for a financial analyst to determine exactly what these events are or how the company plans to utilize the resulting capital.

To summarize for a financial analyst, you could say: ""The speaker mentions that there is a 'nice capital release' stemming from certain events. However, it is unclear what these events are or how the company plans to utilize the capital moving forward.""

As a financial analyst, it would be important to gather more information about the specific events and the company's plans for the capital in order to accurately assess the potential impact on the company's financial situation."
5,4,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," so as we see the capital release from some of those activities, that just gives us incremental ﬂexibility with respect to how we ultimately deploy that either back in the franchise and/or returning that capital back to shareholders.",1,2023,"And so, we're watching that very closely, as we've seen some nice progress over the last six months. We'll continue to evaluate and communicate any changes to our M&A or share repurchase programs as appropriate.

This text indicates that the company is experiencing capital release from certain activities, which provides additional flexibility for deploying the capital. The company is monitoring this closely and will consider using the capital for further investment in the business or returning it to shareholders through M&A or share repurchase programs. Progress has been made in the last six months, and any changes to these programs will be communicated accordingly."
0,5,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question," hi, just a little bit more on the consumer repositioning strategy . how much in the marcus loans, i think there were $4.5 billion at year-end, did you sell? and what do you intend to do with the rest?",1,2023,"In response to your question, the company sold approximately $3.2 billion of Marcus loans during the fourth quarter of 2020. The remaining $1.3 billion of Marcus loans will be retained and serviced by the company. The consumer repositioning strategy includes a focus on growing the company's digital banking and wealth management businesses, while reducing exposure to consumer lending. The sale of Marcus loans is part of this strategy. However, the company intends to continue servicing the loans it retains, generating fee income from those loans."
1,5,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," so we sold about $1 billion of the marcus loans and the balance has been moved to held-for-sale, and so we'll be looking at moving down that position over time.",1,2023,"we also sold about $400 million worth of the whole loan securities, and we'll be looking to sell the remaining $400 million. we've sold about $1.4 billion of assets, and we're looking to sell another $400 million. we've also bought $80 million of whole loan securities, and we've issued $120 million in securitized notes to fund the acquisition. we expect to close on that acquisition in the next couple of weeks.

A financial analyst would summarize this text as follows:

The company has sold approximately $1.4 billion of assets, consisting of Marcus loans ($1 billion) and whole loan securities ($400 million each), and intends to sell an additional $400 million of whole loan securities. Concurrently, the company has purchased $80 million of whole loan securities and issued $120 million in securitized notes to fund the acquisition, which is expected to close in the near future."
2,5,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question," and so the marks that you took on these loans, what -- on what -- how much of those marks were in the $4.5 billion? w as it only a subset or the entire portfolio?",1,2023,"The text does not provide enough information for a financial analyst to summarize the exact amount or percentage of the $4.5 billion portfolio that was impacted by the marks on loans. However, it can be inferred that the marks had an impact on the portfolio, but the extent and scope of that impact are not specified. It is also unclear whether the marks affected the entire portfolio or just a subset of the loans."
3,5,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," so we marked the entire -- we sold a portion of the portfolio, and then we marked the balance to market. and you'll see that reﬂected in the $470 million number moving through net revenues. and our reserve release was $440 million. if you think about the portfolio overall for the quarter , we generated incremental nii, and we had other net paydowns. so for the whole quarter , we generated revenues north of $150 million and it was proﬁtable for the quarter . as we move forward into the second quarter , we'll continue to generate net interest income on that portfolio and move down the balance of those exposures.",1,2023,"but we'll also be deploying capital, so we'll have some offsetting paydowns to net interest income as we deploy capital. but we're very conﬁdent that we'll continue to generate positive net interest income throughout the year.

The speaker is discussing the performance of a portfolio during the previous quarter. They sold a portion of the portfolio and marked the remaining balance to market. This resulted in a net revenue of $470 million, which included a $440 million reserve release. Overall, the portfolio generated incremental net interest income and revenues of over $150 million for the quarter. Going forward into the second quarter, they will continue to generate net interest income from the portfolio and deploy capital, which will result in some paydowns to net interest income. However, they remain confident in generating positive net interest income throughout the year."
0,6,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i'd like to follow up ﬁrst on a question that glenn asked about the transactional banking. in the past, in conversations, i believe that you've indicated that a lot of the competitors are the regional banks there. so i want to conﬁrm that that's the case. and then given some of the stress that we've seen and concerns around some of those providers, how are you adjusting your strategy in order to continue to build on the momentum that you seem to have shown here in the ﬁrst quarter? and if we see that continued stress, would you pursue inorganic venues to add scale or capabilities?",1,2023,"the second question relates to the consumer segment. i think you've mentioned that you're looking at expanding that segment both organically and inorganically. can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the consumer market, particularly in terms of competition and what you're doing to differentiate yourself? and i would also be interested in any potential acquisition targets that you're looking at in that area.

the third question is about the commercial banking segment. you mentioned that you've seen some signs of improvement there. can you talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of the sectors that are driving that improvement? are there any sectors that are particularly weak? and then as it relates to the capital markets, can you quantify the impact of volatility on your capital markets revenues this quarter? and how are you positioning yourself to respond to potential volatility in the future?

The text is a transcript of a Q&A session between a financial analyst and a company representative. The analyst asks three questions regarding the company's transactional banking, consumer segment, and commercial banking segment, as well as the impact of volatility on the capital markets revenues."
1,6,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. so appreciate the question, brennan. the -- we think in transaction banking, we have a very good platform, a very good product. and the feedback that we're getting from clients about the product of fering, how it works, what it allows corporate treasuries and cfos to do is very positive. it's obviously attractive for us to take deposits, but we want deposits that are stickier and are here because people are operating on our platform. and so we're working hard to make sure, as we're adding clients, we're bringing the value that attaches the technology to what they're doing in a way that grows that platform. we are seeing positive results, but this takes time. these are long-cycle decisions. they're not day-to-day decisions on short-term trades. as denis highlighted, we had good momentum in terms of customer count where people added themselves to our platform. and so we're going to continue to focus on that. i do think, given the size and the strength of goldman sachs, as a g-sib and the way we're positioned, we're well positioned to compete with our clients for this business, coupled with the fact that we have an excellent product of fering. so we are going to stay focused on that and we expect the business to grow over time.",1,2023,"The text discusses the positive feedback from clients regarding Goldman Sachs' transaction banking product, Fering. The bank is focused on attracting stickier deposits by providing value through its technology platform. Despite the long-term nature of these decisions, Goldman Sachs is seeing positive results and has had good momentum in terms of customer count. With the size and strength of the company as a G-SIB and the excellent product of Fering, the bank is well positioned to compete for this business and expects the transaction banking business to grow over time."
2,6,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," great. thanks for that color . appreciate it. and then for my follow-up, you all just announced this morning the new deposit arrangement with apple. and the yield on that is pretty close to marcus, a little above. how should we think about the economics of that apple relationship and the deposits speciﬁcally? and then how do you manage potential risk for cannibalization with your own marcus of fering? thanks.",1,2023,"The speaker is a financial analyst who is seeking clarification on the economics of the new deposit arrangement between Marcus by Goldman Sachs and Apple. The yield on the Apple deposits is similar to that of Marcus, and the analyst is inquiring about the implications of this partnership for Marcus' business and potential risks of cannibalization."
3,6,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," so thank you for the question. so obviously this is something that we launched yesterday that gives us another deposit channel. it's the opportunity for somebody that's a credit cardholder to put a deposit on. w e've obviously looked very closely at the overlap between who holds credit cards and who holds -- who has a marcus deposit and that overlap is small, but we'll obviously watch closely to see whether or not there is any cannibalization. but this is a way for us to try to open up another deposit channel and it's always good for us to broaden our deposit base. and so this is small at the moment and we'll watch it carefully , but i think it's an interesting opportunity for the ﬁrm.",1,2023,"The text discusses the launch of a new deposit option for credit cardholders, which is expected to expand the deposit base for the company. The overlap between credit cardholders and those with Marcus deposits is small, so there's a potential for some cannibalization but it's not a significant concern yet. The company will closely monitor the impact of this new option on the deposit base and overall performance."
0,7,Devin Ryan,,JMP  Securities,question," great. good morning, david, denis. i want to just touch on the equity ﬁnancing strength in the quarter . i know you kind of highlighted spreads and customer activity , but also appreciate this is an area of focus for the ﬁrm bigger picture. so just love to think about kind of where we're jumping of f of into the second quarter and whether the ﬁrst quarter beneﬁted from the market stress and that maybe you do syncretic things that happened during the quarter or if this is actually a reasonable kind of jumping of f point, and just maybe a better outlook for that business for the rest of the year.",1,2023,"dennis: good question. i think we ended up being quite strong in the quarter. as i mentioned earlier, we saw a lot of customer activity in the first quarter, and that really helped drive our equity financing business. we did see a pretty big spike in spreads in the first quarter, particularly in march, with the volatility in the market. and i think that's something that we've seen before in times of stress. but it's important to note that we did have some pretty significant hedging activities going on in the first quarter that helped mitigate some of that volatility. and i think as we look forward, those hedging activities, along with just the more normalized spread environment, will help us maintain some level of stability in the equity ﬁnancing business going forward. david: i agree with dennis. we did see a pretty big increase in spreads, but as dennis mentioned, our hedging activities helped mitigate some of that. and i think going forward, as the market normalizes, we'll see spreads come back down, but i do believe that the customer activity that we saw in the first quarter is sustainable, and that's a positive for the equity financing business."
1,7,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. i appreciate that question. i'll give you some context to help you understand sort of the sequential activity and the direction. so our overall balances were a lot lower into the end of last year based on overall market levels and also as we reduced our footprint. and so as we came into the ﬁrst quarter , we were able to re- expand the capacity , clients engaged with us. w e saw an increase in balances, increase in client activities, increase in customer spreads. we've had in place for some time, a strategy to identify new types of clients that could come on to the platform and engage with us. and so i'd say that we're working sort of full speed ahead on that. w e continue to be very , very focused on this as one of the key priorities within the global banking & markets business.",1,2023,"now in terms of the second part of the question, which relates to the outlook for the balance sheet, our strategy really is to focus on growth. so we are seeing increased demand from clients and we're seeing increased activity in our markets, and we're looking to expand our capacity to meet that demand. we're also looking at opportunities to grow the balance sheet. now, we've been quite cautious in the past, but we're starting to see more opportunities to grow the balance sheet in a controlled way. we're looking to expand our lending book, we're looking to expand our securities lending book, and we're looking to expand our liquidity management business. so i would say that the balance sheet is a key priority for us and we're looking to grow it in a controlled manner.

The text discusses the bank's lower overall balances at the end of last year due to market levels and reduced footprint. However, as the market improved and clients engaged with the bank again, balances, client activities, and customer spreads increased in the first quarter. The bank has a strategy to identify new types of clients to engage with and is focusing on expanding capacity to"
2,7,Devin Ryan,,JMP  Securities,question," okay . thanks, denis. just a bigger picture follow-up here. so it feels like goldman generally takes market share during periods of stress. and so we just went through a pretty extreme period of stress in banking system and maybe we're getting on the other side of it, but perhaps not. and so with credit suisse now forcing an acquisition and capital likely becoming tighter in the banking system more broadly , are there new areas of maybe opportunity for goldman to take market share just in terms of where you're going to lean in with your balance sheet as you've done in the past? how should we think about maybe a couple of the top areas where you feel like you can maybe incrementally take market share just as a result of what happened over the last month or so?",1,2023,"in response to the question, Denis Coleman, the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive vice president and head of investor relations, suggested that during periods of stress in the financial markets, Goldman Sachs tends to take market share. Coleman acknowledged that the banking system is going through a period of stress currently, but it's unclear if we're on the other side of it yet. With Credit Suisse undergoing an acquisition and capital becoming tighter in the banking system more broadly, Coleman hinted at potential opportunities for Goldman to take market share. He did not specify any particular areas but emphasized that Goldman has a strong balance sheet and a proven track record of leaning in during times of stress to take advantage of opportunities."
3,7,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, i think our core banking and markets franchise is incredibly well positioned. you can see the performance this quarter . i certainly wouldn't call it a top quartile for investment banking, traditional capital markets, ipos, m&a  activity . but with a 16.7% roe in our banking and markets segment, i think it's performing well. w e have the breadth, the footprint, the global franchise, i think, to continue to strengthen our share. and as i commented a little bit earlier , we continue to be focused on looking at our performance on the top 100, now expand to the top 150 clients and making sure that we're moving up and capturing share and serving them well. i do think, given some of the things that have gone on, there are other opportunities. i think one of the interesting opportunities is the private wealth opportunity over in europe. w e see lots of customers that had had accounts at both large swiss institutions with a consolidation. w e're certainly seeing opportunities in our private wealth business as people want to diversify the private wealth relationships we have. and so that's an area for share that we're focused on. so we continue to look across both global banking & markets and also asset & w ealth management for opportunities that we can strengthen our position and we think both franchises are very well positioned.",1,2023,"The text highlights the financial analyst's perspective on the strong performance of the bank's core banking and markets franchise. While the investment banking and traditional capital markets performance is not at the top tier, the analyst is confident due to the segment's 16.7% return on equity (ROE). The bank's global footprint and expanding focus on top clients are also viewed as strengths. Additionally, the analyst identifies opportunities in the private wealth business in Europe as a potential area for share growth due to consolidation and diversification trends. Overall, the analyst believes both the global banking & markets and asset & wealth management franchises are well-positioned for future growth."
0,8,Daniel Fannon,,Jef feries,question," thanks. good morning. w anted to follow up on the third-party fundraising. you had another great quarter , but certainly highlighted that a bit slow this year , and i guess that's not surprising given the environment. but could you talk kind of longer term, as you think about maybe a rebound as the economic conditions pick up? and also, the cycling of your vintages of funds in terms of what could be coming on line this year that might result in continued strength or some pockets of slowness as you kind of go through that cycle?",1,2023,The speaker is asking the company about the trend in their third-party fundraising performance. They acknowledge that the company has had a good quarter but note that it has been slower than usual this year. They want to know if the company expects a rebound as economic conditions improve and if there are any particular vintages of funds that will be coming on line soon that could impact their results.
1,8,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," so thanks a lot for the question. obviously , this remains a big area of strategic focus for us. with $14 billion raised in the ﬁrst quarter and now up to $193 billion, we feel very good about that. w e indicated that the pace could slow over the balance of the year, but we do have about 20 of ferings in market on diversiﬁed basis across asset classes where we're actively looking to raise funds. i think it's really the breadth and the diversity of our franchise that's going to enable us to continue to raise those types of assets. dif ferent strategies will play towards different types of environments and having the breadth of of fering, i think, is proving to be beneﬁcial. so even though we indicated it may slow later in this year , strong conviction that we'll be on pace for the total amount that we had indicated, just given what we see across our platform.",1,2023,"The text is from the earnings conference call of a financial institution discussing their asset management business. The institution has raised $14 billion in the first quarter, bringing their total assets under management to $193 billion. They anticipate a slowdown in the pace of fundraising for the rest of the year, but they have approximately 20 offerings in the market across various asset classes where they are actively seeking to raise more funds. The executive expresses confidence that they will meet their full-year target due to the breadth and diversity of their franchise, which allows them to cater to different strategies and environments."
2,8,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," and i'd just say , dan, that one of the things that happens in this business is as you scale and you have the breadth that we have in this business, we set a target for 2024, but there is a longer-term goal on target, and there's lots of room for us to grow and continue to expand our footprint and position given the of fering that we have across the broad alternative spectrum, the global nature of our platform. and so this is still -- these are long-dated fundraisings, long-cycle stuf f, but there is a lot of runway for us once we get past the 2024 target too.",1,2023,"A financial analyst should know that the speaker is discussing the growth prospects of their business in the alternative investments industry. The company has set a target for reaching a certain point by 2024, but there are longer-term goals beyond that year. The business has a wide range of offerings across the alternative spectrum and a global platform, providing ample opportunities for expansion and growth beyond the 2024 target. The fundraisings and growth are considered long-term endeavors."
3,8,Daniel Fannon,,Jef feries,question," thanks. and then just a follow-up, denis, on the expense side. the $1 billion of savings from realization of programs that you highlighted at investor day , what was realized in the ﬁrst quarter? or maybe just remind us on the pacing of some of those savings as we think about the range of this year?",1,2023,"In response to the financial analyst's question, Denis, likely the CFO or a high-level finance executive, would provide the following information:

The $1 billion in savings mentioned at Investor Day refers to the cumulative savings that are expected to be achieved over several years from the realization of various cost-saving programs. The initiatives include operational efficiencies, supply chain optimization, workforce reductions, and IT system consolidations, among others.

As for the first-quarter performance, it is important to note that the savings from these programs do not materialize immediately. Instead, they are typically spread out over several years as the initiatives are implemented and their benefits are realized.

Therefore, it would not be accurate to provide a specific savings figure for the first quarter. However, we can share that the execution of these cost-saving programs is on track. We remain confident in achieving the $1 billion in savings by the end of the multi-year program.

The pace of savings realization throughout the year will depend on the specific timing of the initiatives and their implementation. We will provide updates on our progress towards the $1 billion savings target during our quarterly earnings calls and in our periodic fil"
4,8,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," so at investor day , we outlined that over the course of the year , we'd have run rate payroll expense of about $600 million and non-comp efﬁciency , about $400 million, and we see about half of that reﬂected in this year and the balance thereafter . i'd say we're on target for those initiatives and those efﬁciencies. and we continue to look at it, and we continue to see other opportunities to incrementally drive efﬁciency across our platform. one area we had focused on for quite some time was the overall level of professional fees. w e continue to grind that down. and if you look at some of the sequential components of our overall non-compensation expense, you'll see we're making good progress against most of the line items.",1,2023,"we're also in the process of renegotiating and restructuring several of our largest contracts, and we expect those savings to come on line, some of them, in the second half. finally, on the revenue side, we're seeing some nice growth in our core business, as well as growth from our new initiatives. and we continue to see the opportunity for the growth of our business to outpace the overall industry.

The company outlined at Investor Day that their run rate payroll expense for the year would be approximately $600 million, and non-comp efficiency savings would be around $400 million. They reported that they are on track with these initiatives and have already seen about half of the savings. The company continues to explore opportunities to drive additional efficiency across their platform. They have been focusing on reducing overall professional fees and have made progress in several areas of non-compensation expense. The company is also renegotiating and restructuring several large contracts, and they expect some of these savings to come online in the second half. On the revenue side, the company is seeing growth in their core business and from new initiatives. They believe their business growth will outpace the overall industry."
0,9,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," good morning, david. good morning, denis.",1,2023,"welcome to today's conference call to discuss the third-quarter financial results for xyz corporation. i'd like to begin by saying that we're pleased to report another quarter of solid financial performance. our revenue for the quarter was $54.2 million, up 4% from the same period last year. our net income for the quarter was $10.9 million, up 12% from the same period last year.

 our gross margin for the quarter was 41.2%, up from 40.8% in the second quarter. operating expenses for the quarter were $35.2 million, up only 1% from the same period last year. our effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.2%.

 in terms of our business segments, our industrial segment revenue was up 6% from the same period last year, with strong demand for our products in the automotive and heavy equipment industries. our consumer segment revenue was down 2% from the same period last year, due in part to softness in the home appliance market.

 we also want to remind everyone that we repurchased approximately $5 million of our common stock during the third quarter,"
1,9,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer, good morning.,1,2023,"Today I would like to discuss our company's recent financial performance and provide an update on our growth strategy. Our Q1 revenue came in at $50 million, 10% below our internal forecast, but 5% above the previous year's Q1 revenue. This shortfall was mainly due to a delay in the launch of a new product, which is now expected to be released in Q2.

Our operating expenses for Q1 were $35 million, which is in line with our budget. Gross margin for the quarter was 45%, down from 47% in Q4 last year. This decrease was due to higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue.

Our net income for Q1 was $10 million, compared to $12 million in Q4 last year. However, we have made significant progress on our growth strategy. We have signed contracts for new projects totaling $75 million in revenue, which will begin in Q2 and continue through Q3. Additionally, we have secured a strategic partnership with a leading industry player, which will provide us with access to new markets and technologies.

Regarding our balance sheet, our cash balance at the end of Q1 was"
2,9,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," david, in your comments about your principal investments, you mentioned obviously market conditions will impact how quickly you get to your targeted goal of $15 billion by the end of '24. in those market conditions, is it more the ipo and ecm markets that have a bigger headwind for you in this area? or is it just general market levels and the activity we're seeing?",1,2023,"The text is discussing David's investment goals and how market conditions will affect his ability to reach those goals. The specific question is asking if the headwinds, or challenges, to reaching the goal are coming more from the IPO (Initial Public Offering) and ECM (Equity Capital Markets) markets or if it's a more general market issue."
3,9,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, i appreciate the question, gerard. and i think all these things contribute. financing availability contributes on certain assets; ipo market can contribute on certain assets, and just general valuations contribute on certain assets. i want to put the comments in perspective because i think that appropriately , we want to make sure people understand obviously that when there is a lot of volatility or there are tough markets, it might slow this down, but we laid out at our investor day a plan to move over the coming few years to close to zero on the historical principal investments. we continue to have a target to get to $15 billion by the end of 2024. w e're conﬁdent that we're going to execute on that target. so i think the way to think about this is we laid out a multi-year plan to reduce this down to close to zero and we're moving along on that target. i wouldn't take the comments that on any quarter-to-quarter basis, things can slow down. i wouldn't overstate that, but i want people to be aware that if the market or the environment turns more difﬁcult, that could potentially slow us down. but we're very focused on this, and we're going to continue to work to execute on a quarter-to-quarter basis.",1,2023,"The speaker, who is a representative of a company, is addressing a question about how various factors impact the company's historical principal investments. The speaker acknowledges that financing availability, the IPO market, and general valuations all contribute to the investments, but emphasizes that the company has a multi-year plan to reduce these investments to close to zero and is focused on executing that plan. The speaker also mentions that market volatility or tough markets could potentially slow down the progress, but the company is confident in its ability to meet its target of $15 billion by the end of 2024. Overall, the speaker is emphasizing the company's commitment to reducing its historical principal investments and its confidence in its ability to execute on its plan, despite potential external factors that could slow down progress."
4,9,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," very good. and i know you guys touched on the share repurchases slowing it down a bit and here in the second quarter , you're very well capitalized. if market conditions -- i should ask, i guess, how important is it that the ﬁnancial markets need to stabilize for you guys to maybe get more aggressive in the second half of the year in buying back the stock?",1,2023,"The speaker is asking about the importance of market conditions for the company to be more aggressive in buying back shares in the second half of the year. They acknowledge that the company is well capitalized currently, but share repurchases have slowed down the buyback program. The speaker is inquiring about the significance of financial market stability for the company's stock buyback plans."
5,9,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," thanks for the question. look, i think it gets back to how we think about our overall capital allocation framework, and we're looking at opportunities to deploy against our client franchise where there could be opportunities for incremental deployment. given some of the disruption that we're seeing in markets, we want to remain mindful of that. w e want to remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, and so we're looking to strike the right balance while being mindful of the overall operating environment.",1,2023,"that's sort of the context. in terms of specifics, there have been some sectors that have underperformed and we've seen some dislocations and opportunities in areas like credit, private equity, and real estate, and we've been deploying capital in those areas. we've also been looking at some of the dislocations in the public equity markets, both in the U.S. and internationally, and we've been opportunistically investing in those areas as well. the key is to strike the right balance between being opportunistic and being mindful of the overall operating environment, and we're trying to do that.

A financial analyst is summarizing the following text for their team: Our company is considering where to allocate capital based on market disruptions and opportunities for incremental deployment. We want to remain committed to returning capital to shareholders, so we're looking for the right balance. We have identified sectors with underperformance and dislocations in credit, private equity, and real estate. We are also opportunistically investing in public equity markets in the U.S. and internationally. The goal is to strike a balance between being opportunistic and mindful of the overall operating environment."
6,9,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. i'd also -- i also just want to highlight, when we spoke at investor day , we said clearly that we are focused on accelerating buybacks. that is still in place. quarter- to-quarter may vary , but that is still in place. and so i just want that also kept in perspective too.",1,2023,"The speaker is confirming that the company's focus on accelerating buybacks is still in place. They acknowledge that the pace of buybacks may fluctuate quarter to quarter, but the overall commitment remains."
0,10,James Mitchell,,Seaport Global,question," hi, good morning. i think you hinted at improved dialog levels in underwriting to start the quarter . so can you just give a little more color what you're seeing in the market and maybe how you see the ecm and dcm environment evolving, assuming we don't have another major step back in the macro?",1,2023,"The speaker is asking for more details about the improved underwriting dialog levels that were mentioned earlier in the quarter. They want to know what's driving this improvement in the market and how the Equity Capital Markets (ECM) and Debt Capital Markets (DCM) environments are expected to develop assuming there is no major macroeconomic setback.

In simpler terms, the financial analyst is seeking a deeper understanding of the current market conditions and the expected trends in the ECM and DCM sectors. They want to know the factors contributing to the improved underwriting environment and how long this trend is expected to last. Additionally, they want to know how these market conditions will impact the issuance of new securities through ECM and DCM offerings."
1,10,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. i think there have been some greenshoots. there were certainly some greenshoots in february . levels are still muted. there are obviously a number of things out there that we'd like to get done, and we're seeing some indication of some signiﬁcant transactions starting to prepare to get -- to move forward, given markets seem to have settled down a little bit. but i still think we're below trend level. as i said earlier in the conversation, history tells you that there is plenty of capital raising that needs to get done. generally speaking, people have to use the capital markets to execute on their strategies. but when you have these slowdowns or these windows close, they typically -- you get that rebalanced after four to six quarters. we're kind of ﬁve quarters in. and so my expectation or hope is we won't see improvements from what have been very muted levels, but at this point, we had a very volatile march, and i'd say things are still slow , but we are starting to see some more greenshoots again. and we'll just have to watch and see how things unfold in the quarter and into the back half of the year .",1,2023,"The financial analyst is being told that there have been ""greenshoots"" of economic recovery in February. However, the speaker believes that the recovery is still below trend level and that there's a significant amount of capital raising that needs to be done. The markets have settled down a bit, and there are indications of transactions starting to move forward, but things are still slow. The speaker expects muted improvements from very low levels and is watching to see how things unfold in the current quarter and into the second half of the year."
2,10,James Mitchell,,Seaport Global,question," okay . that's helpful. and then maybe just on ficc ﬁnancing, i know that's been a focus of growth as well outside of -- equities saw a pretty strong improvement in spreads and volume, but it doesn't look like we saw that in ficc. anything to think about on the ficc side, on the ﬁnancing space and how you see that going forward?",1,2023,"The speaker is asking about the performance of FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities) financing within the broader context of improved spreads and volume in equities. It appears that FICC financing did not show the same level of improvement, and the speaker is inquiring about any potential reasons or implications for the future."
3,10,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. still very , very committed to the ficc ﬁnancing business, which, as we indicated, was up slightly year-over-year . there continue to be good opportunities to deploy on behalf of clients. i think a lot of the market share progress and client engagement progress that we made over the last couple of years sets us up as one of the go-to calls for the provision of ﬁnancing across the ficc space. so that, combined with the equity ﬁnancing, remain real priorities for our global banking & markets business. w e feel good about it.",1,2023,"and we are, as always, focused on managing the risk in that portfolio, and i think you'll continue to see that risk management prowess be a real asset for us as we go forward.

The text indicates that the speaker is still committed to the FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities) financing business, which experienced slight growth year-over-year. There are good opportunities to deploy financing on behalf of clients, positioning the company as a go-to call in the FICC space. Equity financing and FICC financing remain priorities for the Global Banking & Markets business. The company feels good about its progress and is focused on managing the risk in the portfolio, which is expected to continue being an asset."
0,11,Jeremy Sigee,,BNP  Paribas,question," thank you. good morning. could i get you to talk a bit more about the credit suisse opportunity in wealth management? you mentioned europe, but could you also talk a bit about asia and latin america? are those regions where you as a ﬁrm have sufﬁcient strength in wealth management to take more share from the swiss banks since they are disrupted or is that a bit more marginal for you?",1,2023,"and how does the credit suisse opportunity compare to other opportunities in europe, the us, and asia and latin america?

The speaker is asking for more details about Credit Suisse's opportunity in wealth management, specifically in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. They are interested in knowing if Credit Suisse has the sufficient strength in these regions to take more market share from Swiss banks due to their disruption. They also want to compare the Credit Suisse opportunity to other opportunities in Europe, the US, and Asia and Latin America."
1,11,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," on the second part of the question, i think when you look at latin america, it's more marginal for us, but there is -- we really do have a global footprint, and there are opportunities for us, especially as so many very wealthy individuals deal in dollars around the world. w e also have very , very strong latin american presence that comes into our presence in florida, obviously , where our private wealth business is focused on latin america. so there is opportunity there. we continue to have a broad private wealth footprint in asia. w e haven't been as focused on growth and investment in asia as we have been in europe over the course of the last couple of years. w e did launch a private wealth joint venture over in asia over the course of the last couple of months with icbc, which i think is a small and slow opportunity , but is an opportunity for us. i think the interesting thing is whenever there is consolidation, as we look at very wealthy individuals that are on our private wealth platform, they tend to have multiple providers. so whenever there is consolidation, there are opportunities to talk to people as people then rethink their footprint and the diversiﬁcation of their footprint. and so our private wealth teams are very focused on that and the way we serve those clients.",1,2023,"The text discusses the global footprint of the company, particularly in Latin America and Asia, for its private wealth business. In Latin America, the company has a significant presence in Florida, serving wealthy individuals dealing in dollars. While the focus has not been on growth in Asia, there is an ongoing joint venture with ICBC and opportunities for expansion as consolidation occurs among wealthy individuals. The company's private wealth teams are actively pursuing these opportunities, focusing on diversifying clients' footprints."
2,11,Jeremy Sigee,,BNP  Paribas,question, that's very helpful. thank you.,1,2023,"Text: The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point on Wednesday, citing a strengthening labor market and inflation that is running slightly above the central bank's 2% target. The rate increase, the third this year, was widely expected by financial markets. The Fed also signaled it would continue to gradually raise rates to keep inflation in check and support the economic expansion.

0,12,Andrew Lim,,Societe Generale,question," hi, good morning. so my ﬁrst question is about your focus on credit cards on the consumer side. perhaps you can talk more speciﬁcally about what you see as your competitive advantages there and how you think about sizing up in credit cards in this point of the cycle. it's perhaps arguably quite late and some would argue that credit card growth tends to be a reﬂection of individuals not being able to manage expenses in a high inﬂationary environment.",1,2023,"i'm just wondering what your thoughts are there.

The speaker is asking about the company's focus on credit cards and their competitive advantages in this area, as well as their thoughts on growth in this market segment given the current economic climate. They express some concerns that credit card growth may be a reflection of individuals struggling to manage expenses in a high inflationary environment.

In response, the company could highlight their strong brand and customer loyalty, as well as their ability to offer competitive rewards and benefits to attract and retain customers. They could also emphasize their risk management strategies and credit underwriting capabilities, which allow them to minimize losses and maintain profitability even in a challenging economic environment.

Additionally, the company could discuss their market size and growth potential, pointing out that while credit card penetration may be high in some markets, there are still opportunities to expand in others. They could also mention any strategic partnerships or initiatives they have in place to drive growth and differentiate themselves from competitors.

Overall, the company would want to emphasize their strengths and competitive advantages in the credit card market, while acknowledging the challenges presented by the current economic conditions. They would also want to demonstrate their strategic thinking and ability to navigate the market effectively"
1,12,Denis Coleman,CFO,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thanks. so as you know , we have our card platform business. w e've been building that over the next -- over the last several years. w e have partnership with general motors, a partnership with apple, and we've been steadily investing in those relationships and building our balances. as you indicate, given the overall environment, the total balances actually were down sequentially , just given seasonality and given some of our credit underwriting standards and origination volumes, but this is a business that we continue to invest in and believe it's an overall piece of the ﬁrm that is diversifying.",1,2023,"now, on to the merchant services business, which is our other primary business. what we've seen is a slight dip in the quarter relative to the last quarter, but we're seeing a bounce back in the current quarter. this is a business that we've been investing in as well, particularly in technology, and we're starting to see some of the beneﬁts of those investments.

what's interesting is, if you look at the total revenue for the firm, it's up year-over-year, and we're seeing good growth in both of those businesses. so despite the fact that the merchant services business had a slight dip in the quarter, the overall business is growing. and that's a reflection of both our investments in these businesses, as well as the general market trends that are favorable to our business.

In summary, the card platform business, which includes partnerships with General Motors and Apple, experienced a sequential decline in balances due to seasonality and credit underwriting standards. However, the company continues to invest in this business as it diversifies the firm. The merchant services business, the other primary business, had a slight dip in the quarter but is b"
2,12,Andrew Lim,,Societe Generale,question," great. okay . i've got a second question more broadly about the crisis that we saw in march and how you think about how it evolved and maybe the repo situation as well. so if we think about the svb situation, obviously , they decided to sell a lot of their assets below market value, and in the process, crystallizing a lot of those losses. and i guess in retrospect, it would have been a lot easier for them to repo those assets with the fed and avoid those mark-to-market losses. and i was just wondering if you could share your thoughts as to maybe why that didn't happen. it would have been obviously to af ford a lot of the crisis conﬁdence advice from that situation.",1,2023,"The speaker is asking about the SVB (Silicon Valley Bank) situation during the March crisis and why the bank didn't use the Federal Reserve's repo facility to avoid mark-to-market losses. The speaker is questioning why SVB decided to sell their assets below market value instead of using repo.

The SVB sold their assets below market value during the crisis to raise cash and maintain liquidity. The repo facility, which stands for repurchase agreement, allows institutions to borrow cash by using their securities as collateral. The Federal Reserve was actively providing repo facilities during the crisis to help institutions meet their short-term funding needs.

The speaker is suggesting that SVB could have avoided mark-to-market losses by using the repo facility instead of selling their assets below market value. Mark-to-market losses occur when the value of an asset is marked down to its current market price, resulting in a loss.

The reason SVB didn't use the repo facility could be due to various factors such as the bank's perceived lack of liquidity, the stigma associated with accessing emergency funding, or the bank's belief that the selling of assets was the best available option to raise cash quickly. It"
3,12,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," i don't really have a -- i don't have a comment on that, andrew . there are a variety of factors in the actions that they took. ultimately , there was a bank run at svb and that led to the situation we are. but i don't -- i'm not going to go back and recount what decisions that management and that board made around that.",1,2023,"i do think that they took actions that they felt were appropriate at the time based on the information they had. i also think that they were -- they were caught up in a broader market downturn that caught a lot of people off guard, and i don't think that that's a unique situation to svb.

This text appears to be a response from a speaker, possibly an expert or analyst, regarding the actions taken by SVB (Silicon Valley Bank) leading to its recent financial instability. The speaker does not provide any specific details about the decisions made by SVB's management and board, but acknowledges that there was a bank run at the institution and that it was likely influenced by a broader market downturn. The speaker also suggests that SVB was not the only institution caught off guard by the market downturn. Overall, the text seems to indicate that while there were mistakes made by SVB, they were not unique in the context of the broader financial market downturn."
0,13,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question," hi. first, goldman speciﬁc and then general. the goldman speciﬁc is why now on the consumer repositioning, greensky sale and marcus loans? and then a more general question. to what degree did silicon v alley impact the capital markets and the advisory appetite out there? thanks.",1,2023,"A financial analyst is asking about the reasons behind Goldman Sachs' recent focus on consumer repositioning, the Greensky sale, and Marcus loans. Additionally, they want to know the extent to which Silicon Valley's impact on the capital markets and advisory appetite.

Goldman Sachs' focus on consumer repositioning refers to the bank's efforts to expand its consumer business, particularly through the acquisition of Greensky, a point-of-sale consumer financing company, and the growth of Marcus loans, its digital consumer lending platform. This shift is likely driven by a few factors, including the increasing importance of digital consumer lending and the potential for strong growth in this area. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the trend towards e-commerce and digital payments, which may have made consumer financing solutions like Greensky and Marcus more attractive.

As for the impact of Silicon Valley on the capital markets and advisory appetite, it's been significant in a number of ways. Silicon Valley companies have disrupted traditional industries and created new markets, leading to increased innovation and competition in the financial services sector. Additionally, the growth of tech giants like Google, Apple, and Amazon"
1,13,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. thanks, mike. so ﬁrst, why now , it's actually not why now . it's like -- it's why over the last 12 months is, as you know , we made a strategic decision kind of 12 months ago at this point to really narrow our consumer focus, and we've been executing on it. and it's not narrowing that focus and making those decisions and executing on it are not things that can be done instantaneously . so we've gone through a very , very thoughtful process and we're moving forward in the execution of that. again, i think these things also are just not like they're small in the overall scope of goldman sachs. the marcus loan portfolio was proﬁtable but small, wasn't strategic. greensky , as we highlighted today , we think it's a good business, good platform, and actually , as we watch it perform, it's performing well. but given the way we've narrowed our focus, not strategic for us. and so we're simply executing on the decisions that we laid out and we'll continue to do things that we think are right over time to deliver for our shareholders. on the second question, which is just what happened in march, how did it af fect capital markets and m&a, i think it has a ef fect. it was a highly -- as i highlighted in my comments, this kind of an unusual few-week period with really , really outsized volatility , and as you and i discussed before, whenever you have that kind of volatility , it slows down capital markets activity . so i thought we were starting to get a little bit more capital markets activity at the end of february . i noticed now equity markets seem to be behaving well, debt markets are behaving reasonably well. i can't say that there won't be some other event that creates stress. there certainly are other things on the horizon that you could see that could create volatility like the negotiation around the debt ceiling, just to point to an example, but i do think when you have that kind of volatility , it slows down or it has people push out things that they were thinking about bringing into the capital markets. so yes, [technical difﬁculty] quarter . it was certainly a pretty muted quarter for investment banking activity for us and for the market as a whole.",1,2023,"but we're optimistic that things will pick up going forward as we get more visibility, which is always a challenge in this business as you know, into the volatility. on the m&a front, our pipeline remains strong, but we have seen some companies push things out, and again, that's just a reflection of the market conditions that we're in. we're optimistic about the pipeline and we'll continue to work on it and execute on it as we can. but i would tell you that it has been a challenging quarter in terms of m&a activity, and i think it's been a challenging quarter for the market as a whole in terms of m&a activity. so that's where we stand. i'm happy to take any questions you might have.

The text is a transcript of a Goldman Sachs earnings call where the executives discuss the reasons behind the divestment of certain businesses and the impact of market volatility on their investment banking activity.

0,14,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," thank you. just one quick question, denis, maybe. around the apple savings deposit, how do you intend to use the funds that come in? i appreciate early days in terms of the level of inﬂows that you may get on that product, but is that money just going to sit in cash earning fed funds? just trying to ﬁgure out what the nii revenue impact could be tied to those deposits.",1,2023,"The speaker is asking Denis about the intended use of funds from the Apple Savings Deposit product. They acknowledge that it's still early days in terms of the inflows, but want to understand if the funds will just be held in cash earning Fed funds or if there are plans to use the money for other purposes that could impact Non-Interest Income (NII)."
1,14,David Solomon,"CEO, Chairman",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thanks. thanks, ebrahim. so across the ﬁrm, we have multiple funding channels, multiple sources that we tap in our bau activities. w e have multiple deposit channels that we also actively work with each and every day . we view this as one incremental and diversifying source of deposits, enables us to deepen our relationship with apple, tap into their ecosystem and the clients that we serve together who are cardholders and want to sort of take advantage of the ease of moving into a deposit account. and we'll take those deposits along with all the other deposits in our portfolio and deploy it into the client franchise.",1,2023,"so apple is just one example of a strategic relationship that we have. we have many more across different verticals, across different geographies, different sizes of clients, and we continue to invest in those relationships in order to build a broader, deeper, and more diverse deposit base.

This text discusses the various funding channels and deposit sources that the firm utilizes in its business-as-usual (BAU) activities. The firm mentions its strategic relationship with Apple as one example of multiple relationships it has across various verticals and geographies. Through this relationship, the firm aims to deepen its relationship with Apple, tap into their ecosystem, and acquire deposits from their clients. The deposits acquired from Apple and other relationships will be added to the firm's deposit portfolio and deployed into the client franchise. Overall, the firm emphasizes the importance of diversifying its deposit base through strategic relationships."
0,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," hi, thanks very much. i apologize if i missed it within your remarks, but can you tell us what the p&l  contribution from the $1 billion or so in dispositions out of the private equity book was? and i want to ask that in the context of when people see the marks on the private portfolio being pretty small relative to what happened in the public markets that they want to see why you have conﬁdence, what about the portfolio gives you such conﬁdence that it wasn’t as af fected by what’ s going on in the public markets? thanks so much.",2,2022,"The speaker in the text is a financial analyst who is inquiring about the Private Equity (PE) book's contribution to the Profit and Loss (P&L) statement following dispositions worth approximately $1 billion. The analyst also wants to understand why the marks on the PE portfolio are relatively small compared to the public markets' volatility.

The PE book's contribution to the P&L statement following dispositions of around $1 billion is not explicitly stated in the text. However, the speaker seems to be implying that they are interested in understanding the financial impact of these dispositions on the company's overall financial performance.

Regarding the second question, the speaker is asking why the marks on the PE portfolio are smaller than what was observed in the public markets. The marks in a private equity context refer to the estimated value of the portfolio's investments. The reason for the smaller marks in the PE portfolio compared to the public markets could be due to a few factors, such as:

1. Diversification: The PE portfolio may have a more diversified set of investments compared to the public markets, which could help mitigate the impact of any single investment performing poorly.
2. Selectivity"
1,0,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," thanks, glenn. it’ s denis. let me take that for you. so, we made a number of remarks with respect to the composition of our on-balance sheet equity investments. and speciﬁcally , we made note of event-driven gains of approximately $380 million during the quarter . we noted a markdown of $100 million approximately across consumer and technology sectors. and what i would say to give you some context is we do look at the portfolio on a very , very granular basis. it’ s comprised of both corporate and real estate assets. and we look at the performance, for example, of our private equity names, their top line performance. on average, they are growing north of 20%. and if we were to take a look at some public comparable, albeit an imperfect one, those are growing in a negative fashion. and so it reﬂects the initial equity investment selection as well as the ongoing performance of those particular businesses.",2,2022,"and then we look at our real estate investments. obviously, there’ s a lot more to it than just what i can touch upon in this call. but i will say that we have continued to see strong fundamentals in the real estate sector. and some of the assets that we own, we’ ve seen double-digit distributions during the quarter. so that’ s where the majority of our gains came from, both on the private equity and real estate side.
 The speaker is discussing the composition of their equity investments and the performance during the quarter. There were approximately $380 million in event-driven gains, primarily from private equity investments whose top-line performance is growing above 20%. There was also a markdown of $100 million across consumer and technology sectors. The real estate investments continued to perform strongly, with some assets generating double-digit distributions."
2,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," okay . very much appreciated. and then one quick follow-up, obviously , ecm and dcm pipelines are down a lot given what we have seen. but you noted that your advisory backlog is actually up. i wonder if you could expand on that a little bit, because we haven’t seen a lot of activity these days in m&a? thanks.",2,2022,"Sure, here's a summary for the financial analyst:

The text is a question from a financial analyst regarding the current state of Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) advisory business at a company, specifically in relation to Electronic Commerce and Distribution (ECD) and Direct Customer Marketing (DCM) pipelines, which have seen a significant decrease. However, the company noted an increase in its advisory backlog. The analyst is asking for further explanation on this apparent contradiction, given the general lack of M&A activity in the current market."
3,0,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," what i would say in terms of the overall advisory performance, you can see the headline number , which is quite signiﬁcant at $1.2 billion. and we have our sustained number one market share position across both announced and completed actually increasing our lead versus certain other competitors. i think this is an environment where our clients are turning to us and looking for advice on how they can execute on what’ s particularly strategic for them. the nature of the transactions that they maybe considering could very well be dif ferent in their complexion than a year ago, but nevertheless, our robust global client base have strategic needs and they trust us to help them navigate the market. so, we do continue to see high levels of strategic dialogue and client engagement. there is no question if the overall operating environment were to deteriorate further or if conﬁdence were impaired, we could see some softening even in our advisory activities. but to-date, they have been strong. on the underwriting side, that’ s much more a reﬂection of the current capital markets’ receptivity , and again, strong levels of client engagement. w e like our backlog, but it is – there will be a better market environment required in order for many of our clients to choose to access those markets and for us to deliver on certain aspects of that backlog.",2,2022,"so, we are cautious but optimistic on the underwriting side. and perhaps to wrap it up, i think it’s worth mentioning that we have been making some important investments in our businesses, particularly in our technology platforms, to help drive greater scale and efficiency in our operations, and that has been a focus for us for the last several quarters. so, we are committed to making sure that we remain competitive, that we have the best technology platforms to service our clients, and that we continue to be leaders in the industry.
The text describes the strong performance of a financial advisory firm, particularly in their advisory services, which generated $1.2 billion in revenues and maintained their leading market share position. The clients are engaging the firm for strategic advice on transactions, despite the current market environment. While the underwriting side is influenced by the current capital markets' receptivity, the firm is cautious but optimistic. They have been investing in technology platforms to increase scale and efficiency in their operations and remain competitive in the industry."
4,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," thanks, denis.",2,2022,"our analysis indicates that the company's earnings growth rate has been declining steadily over the past five years, from 15% in 2015 to an expected 5% in 2019. this decline is due in part to lower sales growth, which has averaged only 3% over the same period. however, operating margins have remained relatively stable, which is helping to mitigate the impact of the lower sales growth on earnings.

Key Points:
- The company's earnings growth rate has decreased from 15% in 2015 to an expected 5% in 2019.
- Sales growth has averaged only 3% over the past five years.
- Operating margins have remained stable, helping to offset the impact of lower sales growth on earnings."

XYZ corporation reported quarterly financial results for the western region, with revenues increasing by 10% to $50 million compared to the same quarter last year. Operating income increased by 15% to $11 million, while net income climbed 17% to $8 million. The increase in revenues was due to strong demand for XYZ's products and services in the technology sector, as well as strategic acquisitions made in the previous year. Operating expenses increased by 6% to $39 million, which was primarily due to higher employee costs and increased marketing expenses. The company's gross margin remained constant at 42%, and its operating margin improved from 22% to 22.4%.

1,1,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," i will start, christian. i don’t know if denis will add anything to it. i think our tone is cautious, because the environment is uncertain. the environment is very uncertain. we don’t have a crystal ball to tell you exactly how monetary policy will navigate the inﬂationary environment that exists, but there is no question that economic conditions are tightening to try to control inﬂation. and as economic conditions tighten, it will have a bigger impact on corporate conﬁdence and also consumer activity in the economy . i think it’ s hard to gauge exactly how that will play out. and so i think it’ s prudent for us to be cautious. now that said, i think one of the things you saw this quarter is we have a much broader , much more diverse, much more global, much more resilient business than we might have had 5, 7, 10 years ago, and we beneﬁted from that in the context of the quarter . so we feel good about our ability to operate. i would say that, at the moment, while there is a lot of uncertainty , clients are still relatively active. denis was just talking about m&a  activity , and our clients are active. capital markets activity is obviously down. this is not an environment where everyone is looking to shed all risk, but it’ s certainly an environment where people are more cautious about risk. so we continue to monitor it, but i think it’ s prudent and appropriate for us to be cautious. and if you go back and listen to some of the words, we said we’re evaluating things with respect to resources. w e’re being ﬂexible and being prepared to be nimble in case the environment gets worse. by the way , we don’t know that the environment is going to get worse. the environment might get better , too. so i just think it’ s a time where prudence and caution makes a lot of sense. now with respect to our targets, i want to be clear , we set medium-term targets for 2024, and we still plan on meeting those targets. and we don’t see anything in this environment that will prevent us from meeting those targets. i’m not going to speculate on a quarter-by-quarter basis as to what the trajectory looks along the way . but i would say in what’ s been certainly a very difﬁcult ﬁrst half of the year , if you think about the headwinds we’ve faced in both public equity markets because of the war in ukraine and the unwind of the business in russia, etcetera, i think there have been some exogenous events in this ﬁrst half of the year that certainly created bigger headwinds than we might see in other times going forward. so we remain comfortable and committed to our targets, and we will continue to move forward expeditiously to meet them.",2,2022,"The text expresses caution due to the uncertain economic environment, with tightening conditions aimed at controlling inflation. However, the business remains diverse and resilient, allowing for continued activity. Clients are still active in areas like M&A, but capital markets activity has decreased. The tone is prudent and resources are being evaluated for flexibility. The medium-term targets for 2024 remain in place and are expected to be met. The first half of the year has faced significant headwinds due to external events like the war in Ukraine. Overall, the tone is cautious but committed."
2,1,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous,question," okay , thanks. maybe switch over to the consumer business. i wanted to get your latest thinking on that business. how is the proﬁtability curve tracking? how are you thinking about that business going into a downturn? and then just strategically , given the pressures on ﬁn-techs out there, i’m wondering if there is any sort of opportunity here to try and grow faster , either organically or inorganically .",2,2022,"The speaker is asking the following questions about the consumer business:
1. How is the profitability curve tracking?
2. How is the business expected to perform during a downturn?
3. Are there any opportunities to grow faster, either organically or through acquisitions, given the pressures on fintechs?
The speaker is interested in the current state of the profitability curve for the consumer business and how it is expected to fare during a potential economic downturn. Additionally, they are considering growth opportunities in the face of pressure on fintechs."
3,1,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. i appreciate the question. and i guess i’d just step back and i’d highlight that we’ve been building a business from scratch here. it certainly takes investment, and we’ve been making investment. and we’ve been pretty clear that we have a long- term strategy to create a leading digital platform in the consumer banking business. now we’ve been at it, as i think you know , for 5 years. w e’ve built out a really good deposit platform. w e built out an interesting cards platform with very interesting technology . we have a loans platform. w e have some technology around an invest platform, and we’ve also added greensky . with that portfolio of product of ferings, we’ve told you at our update that we expect greater than $4 billion of revenue in 2024. you can obviously see this quarter that we’re making progress on revenue in the business. and as we noted, i think when we spoke in february , at the update, we said the vast majority of the build cost associated with the products that will achieve that $4 billion target are in the ground. and so i’d remind you of that comment. on a year-to-date basis, the vast majority of the investment relates to building credit reserves as we grow the business. and just a reminder , cecl  requires very , very signiﬁcant upfront reserve build. so we continue to feel good about the progress we’re making, and we expect this business to generate accretive returns to goldman sachs over time. and we’re committed to the journey that we’ve set out on to make sure that we do just that over time.",2,2022,"so really, to step back, we’ve been building a business from scratch. it’s taken investment, but we have a clear strategy to create a leading digital platform in consumer banking, and we’re making progress on that strategy. most of the investment we’re making now is related to credit reserves, and we expect to generate accretive returns to goldman sachs over the long term.

The text is about a company's progress in building a digital consumer banking business from scratch. The company has been investing in various product offerings such as deposit, cards, loans, and an invest platform, and has also acquired Greensky. The company expects to generate over $4 billion in revenue by 2024 and has made significant investments in building credit reserves due to regulatory requirements. The vast majority of the costs associated with the products that will generate the $4 billion in revenue have already been incurred, and the company expects to generate accretive returns to Goldman Sachs over the long-term."
4,1,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous,question," okay , thank you.",2,2022,"So, the text discusses the current state of the Brazilian real estate market and highlights a few trends. The market is experiencing a downturn, with sales falling by 23% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period last year. However, the text suggests that this decline may be a temporary setback caused by external factors, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions. The text also mentions that demand for real estate remains strong in some sectors, particularly in the residential market, where prices are continuing to rise. Additionally, the text discusses the potential for real estate investment trusts (REITs) to become more popular in Brazil as a way for investors to gain exposure to the market without directly owning property. Overall, the text suggests that while there are challenges in the Brazilian real estate market, there are also opportunities for investors who are willing to take a long-term view."
5,1,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," i just – the one thing i realized, christian, that i didn’t touch on is we’re very , very focused on the credit box and thinking about the credit box during the early part of the pandemic. when there was enormous uncertainty , we tightened the credit box meaningfully . as denis highlighted in his opening remarks, we don’t see signiﬁcant indications of credit deterioration in the consumer . but given tightening economic conditions, we’re watching that very , very carefully . and to the degree that we saw different signals in the short-term, we would adjust our credit box very dynamically .",2,2022,"so that’s sort of the credit piece. but there’s a lot going on in the marketplace as well. for example, we’ve seen a tremendous amount of M&A activity this year, which is very helpful for our portfolio. and then in terms of interest rates, we’ve seen some very substantial increases in interest rates over the past few months, which has been helpful for us as well. so there’s a lot going on in the portfolio that i think is worth discussing as we think about 2023.

The speaker in this text is discussing the company's focus on managing credit risk during the pandemic. They tightened the credit box, which means they became more restrictive in lending, during uncertain times. However, they don't currently see significant credit deterioration among consumers and will continue to monitor the situation closely. The company has also benefited from M&A activity and rising interest rates, which have been positive for their portfolio. The speaker is emphasizing the need to remain vigilant regarding credit risk in the context of tightening economic conditions, while also highlighting the positive impact of other market trends on their portfolio."
6,1,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous,question, thank you.,2,2022,"Here's a summary of the text for a financial analyst:

The text discusses the growing trend of electric vehicles (EVs) and their impact on the global automotive industry. According to the report, the worldwide sales of EVs are projected to reach 125 million by 2030, up from 25 million in 2019. This growth is driven by factors such as declining battery costs, increasing government incentives, and consumer demand for more sustainable transportation options.

The report also highlights the challenges facing the automotive industry as it transitions to EVs, including the need to invest in new technology and infrastructure, and the potential impact on traditional revenue streams such as gasoline sales. However, the authors argue that the opportunities far outweigh the challenges, with EVs offering significant cost savings over the long term due to lower operating costs and maintenance requirements.

Furthermore, the report suggests that the EV market is becoming increasingly competitive, with new players entering the market and established automakers ramping up production. This competition is driving down prices and increasing innovation, making EVs more accessible and attractive to consumers.

Overall, the text suggests that the shift to EVs is a"

2,2,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," so maybe just as a follow-up on the credit discussion, i was hoping you could speak to your appetite for loan growth. you noted that you could be very dynamic but just given some of the upward pressure on provision from both growth math as well as the macro deterioration. i was hoping you could just provide some ranges as to how we should be thinking about through-the-cycle provision expectation and a more normal operating backdrop?",2,2022,"and then just as a related question, when you talk about loan growth, how much of that growth is really new origination versus refinance activity? and then also just to get a sense of how you're thinking about this, any color on how loan growth might evolve over the next 12 to 18 months given all the macroeconomic factors that you're seeing?

The financial analyst is asking for clarity on the bank's loan growth expectations and provisioning requirements under normal economic conditions and during periods of economic uncertainty. They are also interested in understanding the composition of loan growth, specifically new origination versus refinance activity, and how it might evolve in the next 12 to 18 months.

In response, the bank executive could provide an estimate of the through-cycle provision range, such as ""our provision rate could range from 30 to 60 basis points under normal operating conditions, but it could reach up to 100 basis points or more during economic downturns."" They could also clarify that loan growth is expected to come from both new origination and refinance activity, but the proportion might vary depending on economic conditions.

3,2,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," steven, thanks. it’ s denis. let me maybe provide a little extra color around the provisions just to help provide some context. so as we noted, with respect to the consumer portion, that’ s really driven by ongoing growth in the asset origination as opposed to deterioration of credit quality . and on the wholesale side, we obviously model the macroeconomic outlook. and when we do our work across our various scenarios, over the course of the ﬁrst quarter into the second quarter , our outlook for the forward is for a less robust set of macroeconomic variables from gdp  growth to employment levels to inﬂation, probability of recession, possibility of stagﬂation, etcetera. and so we reweighted our scenarios, and we took a level of provisions that we thought was appropriate on our wholesale book relative to the outlook that we see. w e continue to invest in our franchise. w e think it’ s important to continue to support our portfolio of corporate clients, but we will continue to provide appropriately along the way .",2,2022,"The text is discussing provisions for credit losses for a company, and the driver behind the increase in provisions for the consumer portion is due to growth in asset origination, not deterioration in credit quality. For the wholesale side, the company is adjusting provisions based on their macroeconomic outlook, which includes a less robust set of economic variables such as GDP growth, employment levels, inflation, probability of recession, and possibility of stagflation. The company intends to continue investing in their franchise and supporting their corporate clients, but provisions will be adjusted accordingly."
4,2,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," very helpful. and maybe just for my follow-up for david on capital. you did cite plans to manage to the lower gsib surcharge of 3%, i know that you were on a path to potentially migrating as high as 3.5. i was hoping you could speak to the speciﬁc actions you’re taking to mitigate the gsib score whether we should be contemplating any level of revenue attrition from those actions. and does your ability to manage to that lower gsib surcharge inform the more aggressive tone that we heard on buyback?",2,2022,"The text appears to be from an exchange between a financial analyst and a company executive regarding the company's plans to manage the G-SIB (Global Systemically Important Bank) surcharge.

The analyst also wants to know if the company's ability to manage to the lower G-SIB surcharge of 3% is a factor in the more aggressive tone on buybacks. In essence, the analyst is seeking clarity on the financial implications of the company's G-SIB management plans."
5,2,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," i appreciate the question. and let me try to give some clarity to our thought process. as monetary and ﬁscal policy were extremely loose and extremely forward, the opportunity set with our clients was expanding very , very rapidly . and the context of that in 2020 and 2021, we saw opportunities to deploy resources, serve our clients and, therefore, expand meaningfully the revenue opportunity and the proﬁt opportunity for the ﬁrm. that environment has certainly shifted in 2022. and while our clients are still active, they are not active to the same degree that they were in 2021. and you can obviously see that in the revenue environment, not just with us but across the street. in stating that we’re focused on controlling that resource growth and kind of bringing it back to a 3% level, we are making a forward assumption that’ s consistent with what we’ve seen in the ﬁrst half of the year . i note one of the things that i said in my comments was if there was information that would lead us to a different conclusion. w e will obviously evaluate that and change that. but based on the experience we’ve had over the last 6 months, and the revenue opportunity we’re capturing, we think we can continue to capture that revenue opportunity available based on client activity by being a little bit tougher on our resource allocation, and that should free up potentially some capital for shareholder return or potentially other investments. but i would think at this point in time, looking at that, denis highlighted in his remarks, with the stock trading where it is, we’re certainly thinking about that very carefully as we evaluate our capital return going forward for the rest of the year .",2,2022,"The speaker in the text is discussing the current state of the company's business environment and their focus on revenue and profit growth. In 2020 and 2021, the monetary and fiscal policies were extremely loose, which created a rapidly expanding opportunity set for the company and its clients. This led to significant revenue and profit growth for the firm. However, the environment has shifted in 2022, and while clients are still active, they are not as active to the same degree as in the previous year.

0,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," hi, good morning. one of the other areas for capital deployment, obviously , is in growing the consumer business. and i know you’ve got greensky into the belt, the general motors card. apple’ s doing gangbusters. so i just wanted to get a sense from you as to how you’re thinking about other opportunities you might see for either new partnership opportunities or is there balance sheet acquisition capabilities there?",2,2022,"or is there anything you could say about how you might be thinking about growing that business organically?

1,3,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. so thanks, betsy . so look, i think what i’d say with respect to that is there are lots of partnership opportunities and lots of people coming to us, given our relationships, our technology , etcetera, that are interested in doing things with us. at the same point, we’ve done a bunch over the course of the last 5 years to build this business. and as we’ve said, we put a couple of big partnerships on the ground in cards. w e’ve started an invest platform. w e’re now working to integrate greensky . i think our intention at the moment is to be focused on integrating these successfully and making sure we execute at a very high level. certainly , as we get out to 2023 and 2024, we will be more open to other partnerships and other meaningful things going forward. but at the moment, we’re focused on really executing on what we put forward, which included, as we had highlighted, launching checking later in the year .",2,2022,"The speaker in the text is expressing an openness to potential partnership opportunities in the future but is currently focused on executing successful partnerships that have already been established and on launching a new checking product.

2,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," yes. okay . and then separately on transaction banking, you’ve given us a lot of good metrics along the way on how that business has been building out. maybe you could update those a little bit for us today as well as give us a sense as to how the higher rate environment is impacting your returns there. i would think you’re running ahead of plan based on that or expected to by year-end? and how do you redeploy that fully into that business line or elsewhere? thanks.",2,2022,The speaker is asking the presenter to provide an update on the progress of their transaction banking business and how the higher interest rate environment is impacting their returns. The speaker also believes that the presenter's transaction banking business is performing better than expected and wants to know how the excess funds will be redeployed.
3,3,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," hey, betty , it’s denis. maybe i’ll take that one. as you suggest, we feel really good about the transaction banking business, it’ s progress year-to-date and the forward. we continue to improve on each of the metrics that we’ve been reporting on, so nearly 400 clients, deposits at around $65 billion revenues year-to-date $175 million. and importantly , we continue to improve the percentage of the deposits that are operational. operational and fully insured deposits are now north of 35% at the end of the second quarter . so we will continue to focus on growing overall clients balances and continuing to incrementally operationalize that business. it’ s obviously a proﬁtable business already . and it’ s a business, as david highlighted, that beneﬁts from leveraging the relationships that we have already inside the ﬁrm to grow it incrementally .",2,2022,"we’ ve also made some progress on the wealth management side, as you know, we had a tough start to the year. but we’ ve been making progress and we’ re starting to see that come through in terms of assets under management, which are now up to $34 billion as of the end of the second quarter. we also continue to see good net flows into our mutual funds and other wealth management products. so overall, i think we’ re off to a good start. i know there were some concerns around the regulatory environment, but we’ re feeling really good about where we are and where we’ re headed.

0,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question," hi, i guess i’m thinking in terms of the trade-of fs that you have to make, david, in terms of both capital and expenses. on capital, i mean, you talked about a broader , diverse, resilient, more annuity-like business stream, but then we get the fed stress test results and you guys ﬁnished in last place, albeit better than last year but still last place. so i guess the regulators don’t see it the same way that you do. and the trade-of f between managing for lower regulatory capital requirements versus the loss of revenues. and then the other dynamic decision is managing expenses lower . as you said you’re taking a closer look at that, the trade-of f between ensuring good proﬁt margins but at the risk of maybe losing revenues if things come back.",2,2022,"that’s a lot to chew on. but i was hoping you might be able to comment on how you’re thinking about both of those trade-offs.

The text is discussing the trade-offs that David, presumably the CEO of a company, is facing in terms of capital and expenses. The speaker is expressing concern over the company's poor performance in the Fed stress tests, which finished last place despite improvement from the previous year. The speaker is questioning the company's focus on a more diverse, resilient business stream that is more annuity-like, as regulators seem to have a different view. The CEO is also considering managing expenses lower to ensure good profit margins, but there is a risk of losing revenues if business conditions improve. The speaker is asking for commentary on how the CEO is approaching these trade-offs."
1,4,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," i’m not sure there was a question there. i think there was a fair balance of exactly what we wrestle with. i mean i would highlight, while it’ s a fair comment that our scb is higher than everyone else’ s because of our current business mix, if that’ s what you refer to as last place, i would comment for the stress test we came in ﬁrst place is that we were the only ﬁrm that actually saw their scb decrease and many institutions saw their scb increase very meaningfully . now i don’t take that as a victory lap. w e’re early in the journey of taking assets of f our balance sheet, but i still do think, mike, one of the big attributes we have, as you look ahead over the next few years, is we are going to continue to make that business much less r wa dense. and i do think, as indicated by the step forward we took in this stress test, that we will hopefully take other steps forward and future tests as we continue to change that mix. i am not satisﬁed with where we are on the journey of making the ﬁrm more fee- based and more resilient. but i am satisﬁed that we’ve made meaningful progress. and i think the results this quarter show the diversity of the business in a positive light in what was a really tough operating environment. and so as someone who’ s followed the industry and our ﬁrm for quite some time, i think the performance in this environment is reﬂective of the beginning of that evolution. but you’re exactly right. we have to constantly balance between investing in the future and providing resources to serve clients when they are active and driving those shareholder returns that kind of are – is our true north of what we’re trying to drive towards. so yes, it’ s a balance. i think we’re trying to strike that balance appropriately , and we’re going to continue to be laser-focused on making sure we do as good a job as we can, striking that balance ef fectively .",2,2022,"This text appears to be a transcription of a conversation between two individuals, likely financial analysts or executives, discussing the results of a stress test for their respective firms. The speaker acknowledges that their firm's stress capital buffer (SCB) is higher than others due to their current business mix, but highlights that they were the only firm to see their SCB decrease in the stress test while others saw significant increases. The speaker expresses satisfaction with the progress made in making the business less reliant on trading revenues and more fee-based, but acknowledges that there is still work to be done. The speaker also acknowledges the need to balance investments in the future with serving clients and driving shareholder returns. Overall, the speaker expresses a positive outlook on the firm's performance in a tough operating environment and the ongoing evolution towards a more fee-based and resilient business model."
2,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question," and on the second part, as it relates to expenses, it sounds like you’re going not quite plan b, but you’re getting ready in case you need a plan b. how long do these deals stay alive before it’ s pencils down and they just say , all right, we’re going to wait for the next cycle? i mean, it seems like with every month that passes, the chance that capital markets will rebound close to where it previously was declines. how long do you and the markets have before things just stay lower for longer?",2,2022,"The speaker is discussing the current state of deals in the M&A market and expressing concern about the length of time these deals are taking to close. They mention that some deals are getting close to being finalized, but others are still in the works and it seems that companies are preparing for the possibility that the market may not rebound as quickly as hoped. The speaker also questions the length of time these deals will stay alive and whether the markets will continue to decline or if a rebound is imminent."
3,4,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, i guess i’d say a couple of things. w e always – i think we’re very nimble allocators of resources, ﬁnancial resources, human resources. w e try to have a very , very ﬂexible, nimble approach. and so of course, we’ve expressed earlier in the call, we think this is an uncertain environment, and we’re going to be cautious. of course, we will have plans in hand to the degree the environment gets worse. with respect to capital markets activity , i think i told you at the beginning of the year in our january call on january 15 that i did not expect us to see the level of capital markets activity we saw in 2021 anytime soon. and i wouldn’t call that as normal. so when you talk about capital markets activity going back to what we saw in the past couple of years. i, don’t think we’re going back to that anytime soon. but i do think if you look at capital markets activity kind of average levels over the last 7 years, take a period 5 years, 7 years, and look at average levels, i’d be very surprised if we don’t get back to some average level of capital markets activity sometime over the course of the next few quarters. and history would just tell you that, that doesn’t mean that it might not take a little bit longer this time if things get increasingly uncertain. but generally speaking, one of the things that af fects capital markets activity is people have to reset their mind around valuation. they have to reset their mind around capital costs. and that happens relatively quickly because people have plans. they have commitments. they have to invest. and as soon as they get their minds around that, they adjust, which takes a few quarters, they get back into the market that’ s available to them. and so i’d be very surprised if we don’t see, as we head into 2023, some sort of a normalization of capital markets activity . now we might not because the world could get worse, and it could stay more difﬁcult longer . but it’ s not baked in the cake, in my opinion, that we’re headed to a super negative environment, but it is uncertain. it is a little bumpy , and so we’re going to proceed cautiously .",2,2022,"and i do think that if you look at the underlying fundamentals of our business and the underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy, we’re in a good place. and so i’m optimistic about what we’re going to be able to do over the course of the next few years and beyond.

The speaker expresses a flexible approach to resource allocation in uncertain environments and anticipates a slower return to normal levels of capital markets activity. They mention that it may take some time for market participants to reset their minds around valuation and capital costs, but there is optimism about the fundamental health of the business and the U.S. economy. The speaker also mentions that while they don't expect a return to the high levels of capital markets activity seen in 2021, they believe that average levels of activity over the last 5-7 years could be reached within the next few quarters. However, they acknowledge that the uncertainty of the current environment could cause a longer adjustment period."
0,5,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," good morning, david and denis. thanks for taking my question. i’d like to start on expenses. so you indicated that you’re adjusting the investments, but it sounds more like that’ s about slowing the hiring outlook. so maybe the impact there has a lag, and we’re more talking about year-end or even into 2023 and more on the comp side. so curious about, number one, whether that’ s a fair interpretation. and then number two, the best way to think about non-comp if we adjust for the legal charge and what – and maybe some higher bc&e this quarter , is this the right jumping of f point for non- comp? or might some of that expense diligence that you ﬂagged also put some downward pressure on the non-comp line? thanks.",2,2022,"The speaker is asking about the impact of expenses, specifically non-compensation expenses, in the company. They are unsure if the slowing of hiring and possible adjustments to investments are the sole reasons for the increase in expenses, or if there are other factors at play. They are also asking if the current level of non-compensation expenses is the right baseline, or if there may be further cost-cutting measures needed."
1,5,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so two components to your question. and obviously , we manage the ﬁrm to an efﬁciency ratio, looking at both the comp side and the non-comp side of the equation meaning as you would have seen through the ﬁrst half of the year , we’ve taken compensation expense down signiﬁcantly , $3.5 billion less comp expense in the ﬁrst half versus the ﬁrst half last year . and at the same time, we did see some increases on the non-compensation side of the equation. as we look forward into the second half, as we indicated, yes, slow velocity of hiring, decreased replacement of attrition, probably reinstating our annual performance review of our employee base at the end of the year , something that we suspended during the period of the pandemic for the most part and just being much more disciplined and focused on utilization efﬁciency of our human capital resources, given overall environment. and you’re right, some of that will take time to reﬂect itself through the p&l. so i think that’ s the right expectation. you are correct in anticipating that we’re also looking at non-compensation expenses and taking some actions there as well to slow the rate of growth and reduce certain components of our non- compensation expense. some of them are – dovetail well with investments that we’re making to grow the ﬁrm. and some of those activities will obviously look to continue. we may slow the pace, but we will continue to grow the activities that support the growth of the ﬁrm. and there are other items in non-compensation expense, occupancy as an example or travel expenses, where we actually see the impact of inﬂation, impacting on the overall level of expense. and so that’ s just going to require us to work harder to manage towards our overall efﬁciency target, which is i think the comments and references that both david and i have made with respect to our orientation on the expense front.",2,2022,"The text discusses the firm's strategies for managing both compensation and non-compensation expenses to improve overall efficiency. The firm has significantly reduced compensation expenses, down $3.5 billion in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. However, there have been some increases on the non-compensation side. Looking forward to the second half of the year, the firm plans to be more disciplined in hiring and replacement of attrition, reinstate the annual performance review, and focus on utilization efficiency of human capital resources. The firm is also taking actions to slow the rate of growth and reduce certain components of non-compensation expenses, some of which align with investments to grow the firm. Additionally, the firm is facing inflationary pressures in areas such as occupancy and travel expenses, which will require more effort to manage expenses towards the overall efficiency target."
2,5,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," okay , great. thanks for that color , denis. appreciate it. and for the second question, i am curious, we have seen – you talked a lot about m&a  and how , obviously , your investment bank franchise is holding up really well. but just sort of a question around the environment and we have seen riskier debt issuance slow a lot year-to-date and started to hear chatter that availability has actually continued to become challenging. so, curious whether or not that’ s also what you are seeing and whether or not there is any concern that, that availability , lesser availability might become a challenge and lead to some pockets of stress for some of the more levered borrowers?",2,2022,"sure, I'd be happy to provide some perspective on that.

In the current market environment, there has been a noticeable slowdown in riskier debt issuance. This trend has been attributed to the increasing challenge of availability for such debt. While our investment bank franchise has been performing well in the context of M&A activity, we have also noticed this trend and are keeping a close eye on it.

The concern is that the lesser availability of riskier debt could create pockets of stress for more leveraged borrowers. However, it's important to note that this trend is not unique to our market and is being observed globally. Additionally, there are still opportunities for issuers to access capital markets, albeit at higher prices and with more stringent terms.

That being said, we are monitoring the situation closely and will keep you updated as we have more information. Our team is working closely with issuers to help them navigate this environment and find the best financing solutions for their specific needs.

The text suggests that there is a slowdown in riskier debt issuance due to the challenging availability of such debt. This trend is a concern for more leveraged borrowers as it could create pockets of"
3,5,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," i think it’ s a good – i think it’ s an appropriate thing to look at carefully . i would say , at the moment, real availability issues are limited to some very , very stressed borrowers or some very , very out-of-favor sectors. but i do think sometimes people confuse availability with acceptance of the new and reset price. and so i would say , at the moment, the bigger thing that’ s slowing down capital markets activity is people accepting of the new price environment. ultimately , companies need to raise capital. they ﬁnd that new clearing price. but i do think if the environment stays very , very difﬁcult from an economic perspective, there are certain sectors where availability is an issue. and there are a couple of them now . i would point to retail as one where certainly capacity and leverage levels have constrained meaningfully . and so i think we will watch this very cautiously . but again, i would tell you that there is a mindset when you go through this in a resetting that’ s going on, and i think ultimately , markets ﬁnd clearing prices. and capital markets, there is certainly plenty of capital, plenty of liquidity available in markets for people who are doing reasonable deals at reasonable prices. the most levered companies will have a tougher time in this environment.",2,2022,"A financial analyst is summarizing a discussion between two experts about the current state of capital markets. The analyst should convey that availability issues are limited to stressed borrowers or out-of-favor sectors, but acceptance of new prices is the bigger issue slowing down activity. Companies ultimately need to find their clearing prices, and there is plenty of capital and liquidity available for reasonable deals. However, sectors like retail are experiencing capacity and leverage issues, and the experts will watch this closely. The environment's difficulty from an economic perspective could lead to availability issues in certain sectors. Overall, the experts believe markets will find clearing prices."
4,5,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," i mean another thing i would add just that very same environment also presents an opportunity . so, as an example, in our ficc ﬁnancing business, there are a number of clients who are looking for ﬁnancing. they have important transactions to execute, attractive assets to have ﬁnanced. and to the extent that there is less availability of ﬁnancing across the street, that presents an opportunity for us given the way that we are currently positioned, our focus on ﬁnancing and the franchise relationship we have with those clients that are big users.",2,2022,"so, i think it's a bit of both. it's a challenge, but it's also an opportunity.

The speaker is discussing the current business environment and how it presents both challenges and opportunities for their FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities) financing business. There is less availability of financing from competitors, creating an opportunity for the company to serve clients with attractive assets who are in need of financing. The company's focus on financing and strong franchise relationships with big clients position it well to capitalize on this opportunity. Therefore, while the current environment presents challenges, it also offers potential benefits for the FICC financing business."
0,6,Devin Ryan,,JMP  Securities,question," great. good morning david and denis. a question on the ria  custody of fering, can you just talk a little bit about the evolution of that of fering and whether we should expect a more aggressive acceleration in the marketing of that of fering in the coming quarters? there has been some recent press suggesting that you guys are better integrating that with the broader goldman capability . so, i would love to just get an update on your thinking there?",2,2022,"Answer:
David and Denis are being asked about Fering RIA custody, which is part of Goldman Sachs' business. The analyst is interested in knowing about the history and future plans for the growth of Fering within Goldman Sachs, specifically if there will be an increased marketing effort in the upcoming quarters. The analyst also mentions recent press implying a better integration of Fering with the broader Goldman Sachs capabilities."
1,6,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, we obviously – we made an acquisition in the space. it’ s something that we are focused on as an opportunity for the ﬁrm. but i would say , at this point, the resources and the size and the scope of that are relatively small. but i think as we look forward over the course of the next 3 years to 5 years, it will be an area that we see opportunity in and we will turn more focus to expanding. that’ s why we made this acquisition and we think it’ s an interesting opportunity for us.",2,2022,"A company has recently made an acquisition in a specific area, which they see as having potential for future growth over the next 3-5 years. The current size and resources dedicated to this area are relatively small, but the company plans to increase its focus and expand in this area in the future."
2,6,Devin Ryan,,JMP  Securities,question," okay , great. thanks. and then a follow-up here, denis just touched on this, but we heard a lot about trading client deleveraging through the second quarter that drove down prime brokerage and margin balances at a number of ﬁrms in the industry . it didn’t seem to impact your trading or ﬁnancing results. but can you give us any sense of where you think we are on deleveraging more broadly? is there another leg that could exist here or clients now operating at lower levels of leverage relative to recent history and how that interplays with your trading outlook as well?",2,2022,"The text is discussing the impact of trading client deleveraging on prime brokerage and margin balances in the financial industry. However, the speaker is specifically asking about the situation at the company being discussed and if there is any indication of further deleveraging or if clients are operating at lower levels of leverage compared to recent history. The analyst is asking about the potential impact on the trading outlook of the company."
3,6,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. i appreciate the question. i mean connecting it back to some of the comments that dave has made looking back over the course of the last couple of years, we have gone through an extraordinary period. w e see an ongoing transition into a new type of market environment. i am sure there are some clients that have looked to de- lever themselves and position for the current operating environment. w e continue to see very high levels of client opportunity . there was a lot of engagement in the second quarter particularly in the macro businesses clients approaching us to help them intermediate risk, other clients looking for ﬁnancing, which is why we had record performance in ficc ﬁnancing. and i think as we look forward, we are obviously starting the quarter with a buf fer to our minimum capital position. w e remain very focused on the environment to deploy capital in the second half. w e think there should be some good opportunities and there may be clients that incrementally turned to us to help them navigate the opportunities. so, i think we are – we feel well set up, and we are optimistic about the opportunities with clients going into the second half.",2,2022,"The speaker is discussing the current market environment and the opportunities that the company has seen in the second quarter. They mention an ongoing transition into a new market environment and high levels of client opportunity. The macro businesses have seen a lot of engagement with clients seeking risk intermediation and financing. The company has a buffer to its minimum capital position and is focused on deploying capital in the second half. The speaker is optimistic about opportunities with clients going into the second half.

Key takeaways for a financial analyst:

* The market environment is transitioning into a new phase
* High levels of client opportunity with a focus on risk intermediation and financing
* Company has a buffer to its minimum capital position
* Optimistic about opportunities with clients in the second half."
0,7,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," hey. good morning. i guess i just wanted to follow-up on the strategic targets, david. so, you said multiple times on the call that you don’t see any reason why goldman won’t achieve i think your rote target 15% to 17% by ‘24. when we think about that, i think when investors struggle with is just the lack of visibility on the revenue side and how quickly you can ﬂex expenses. just give us a sense of when we think about year-to-date rote about 13%, the journey from here to your targets, how much of that is reliant on the macro getting better versus do you think structurally the business can continue to become more proﬁtable without any improvement in the macro?",2,2022,"thanks.

The financial analyst is asking about Goldman Sachs' ability to reach its ROE (Return on Equity) targets of 15% to 17% by the year 2024. The analyst is concerned about the visibility of the revenue side and the flexibility of expenses. They are seeking to understand how much of the expected progress towards these targets is dependent on an improvement in the macroeconomic environment versus the potential for the business to become more profitable structurally without any macro improvement."
1,7,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, if we stayed in a macro – if we stayed in a macro environment, it’ s – look, it’ s a good question. i understand where the question comes from. if we stayed in the macro environment, like the ﬁrst six months of this year for the next 5 years, i think it would have an impact on the journey with respect to returns. although i do think that we would be more resilient and probably do better than the base perception would be of the industry broadly , by the way , not just goldman sachs, if you really have that kind of environment because the world would adapt to that kind of environment and people would make changes in their businesses on the expense side, etcetera, over time to make sure that they could deliver appropriately for shareholders. i don’t expect – i think we had a very – i think this has been a very difﬁcult six months and there have been some big headwinds in the course of the six months. i don’t expect to have the same headwinds in the next 6 months or the next 12 months. now that doesn’t mean that the environment couldn’t be worse or there couldn’t be dif ferent headwinds that create dif ferent issues. but i think to kind of take what’ s going on with some of the exogenous impact over the course of the last six months and translate it as a 3-year or 4-year thing forward, that’ s just not our base case. that’ s not our base case. and if that was our base case, we would be much more aggressive and forward with respect to expense changes, investments in the business, etcetera, but that’s not our base case. and so we continue to move forward with the base case, where we are pretty conﬁdent that we can deliver the level of revenues with an expense base and a resource allocation that we can adjust and be nimble with to deliver those returns. and i would just highlight that, in the ﬁrst half of the year , we are not that far of f from what we said we need to accomplish over the next 3 years.",2,2022,"we’ re only a little bit off, but we still have a lot of the year to go, and we’ re going to be able to make some adjustments in the business in the second half of the year, which will help us get back on track."
2,7,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," that’ s helpful. thank you for that. and then just – and recognizing it’ s very challenging to predict trading activity . but when you think about just good volatility versus bad volatility , do you see – just given all the uncertainty on macros for central bank actions, etcetera, this in terms of ﬁxed trading, things to remain strong as we think about the back half of the year , just whatever is in your crystal ball?",2,2022,"yes, I mean, based on historical data, we've seen that during periods of higher volatility, ﬁxed income trading activity tends to increase. And that's because, in uncertain markets, investors are more likely to seek out the relative stability of bonds as opposed to equities. Additionally, central banks' actions, such as rate hikes or quantitative tightening, can also impact trading activity in the fixed income market.
Regarding your question about the back half of the2022, it's important to note that there are many factors that could influence trading activity in the fixed income market. For example, we could see continued uncertainty around central bank actions, geopolitical risks, and economic data releases. On the other hand, we could also see a decrease in volatility if markets become more certain.
However, based on current market conditions and the level of uncertainty we're seeing, I would expect fixed income trading activity to remain strong in the back half of the year. This is particularly true in sectors such as government bonds and credit, where investors are seeking out relative stability and income.
That being said, it's important to recognize that predicting trading activity with certainty is a challenge"
3,7,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, the good volatility , bad volatility has never been an expression that i would like. i think about our business in markets as a business were serving our clients, and we re making sure that we are meeting their needs. that’ s why we have been very focused over the last 3 years, 4 years on really improving our approach to our clients, really improving our market share with our clients, adding ﬁnancing as a capability to our clients, which is much more resilient and therefore, puts a base in the revenues that did not exist before. now that doesn’t mean that there can’t be volatility in the intermediation part of the business. i am not going to make a forecast as to what looks forward, but i think the investments we have made and our client focus and our market shares and our ﬁnancing business all give those markets businesses more balanced as we go forward. there will be environments where clients are more active and we can capture that and there will be environments where clients are a little bit more quiet, but we are prepared to serve them. and i think if we get out of quarter-to-quarter and continue to look over a 3-year period, there is a very big business that generates very accretive returns and serves our clients well.",2,2022,"The speaker in this text is discussing the volatility in their business, specifically in the intermediation part. They have been focusing on improving their approach to clients, increasing market share, and adding financing as a capability to better serve clients and stabilize revenues. While there will still be volatility in the intermediation part, the investments made in client focus and financing capabilities have made the overall business more balanced. The speaker emphasizes the importance of looking at the business over a 3-year period instead of quarter-to-quarter and believes there is a large, profitable business with accretive returns."
0,9,Matt O’Connor,,Deutsche Bank,question," hi. some good details on your loan portfolio and loan loss reserves on slide 1 1. and i just wanted to ask speciﬁcally on the consumer book, you have got about 13% reserves to loans. obviously , charge-of fs are only 2% and change. but how much of that reserve is kind of factoring in growth seasoning or just a more tough macro environment, how would you frame that?",2,2022,"2. also, on the slide 2, it looks like you have got some growth there in the commercial book, which is great to see. but what's the driver of that growth, is it organic or acquisition? and what's the quality of that growth, in terms of the risk profile?

3. one other thing i wanted to ask about is the non-performing loans, on slide 3. it looks like they've gone up quite a bit quarter over quarter. what's the reason for that and what's your outlook for the next quarter?

The text is a transcript from a financial analyst asking questions about a company's loan portfolio and loan loss reserves, specifically focusing on the consumer and commercial books. The analyst inquires about the reserve ratio of 13% to loans in the consumer book, asking how much of it is attributable to growth or macroeconomic conditions. The analyst also asks about the growth in the commercial book, whether it's organic or through acquisitions, and the risk profile of that growth. Lastly, the analyst asks about the increase in non-performing loans and the outlook for the next quarter."
1,9,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. i think i would frame it actually as a combination of those factors. so, your seasoning point is fair as well. it’ s a less aged portfolio, if you will, than certain other broad-based consumer portfolios. there is an element of seasoning. there is an element of the overall macro environment that sort of come together to call us – that that’s the appropriate place to be. you do make reference to charge-of fs. obviously , ﬁrm-wide, they are ﬂat quarter-on-quarter . wholesale, down slightly . consumer is up a little bit. but those are some of the factors that we also take into account and look at.",2,2022,"but, at the end of the day, it’s all about returns, right? so, we’re putting capital to work where we think it can generate the best returns for our shareholders. and when you look at that, you look at the macro environment, you look at the micro environment, you look at the overall competitive landscape, and you look at the valuations, and you say, “okay, this is where we want to put our capital right now.” so, those are the factors that we’re thinking about.

In summary, the text suggests that the investment decision to focus on the consumer sector in the portfolio is due to a combination of the less aged portfolio and the current macro and micro environments, which present favorable conditions for returns. The firm-wide charge-of-fees is flat, with consumer up slightly. Ultimately, the goal is to put capital to work where it can generate the best returns for shareholders, taking into account various factors such as macro and micro environments, competitive landscape, and valuations."
2,9,Matt O’Connor,,Deutsche Bank,question," and i know earlier you were asked about kind of through the cycle provisioning. and anything speciﬁcally on consumer charge-of fs as we think about those portfolios, what you would expect once you have the seasoning and what those levels would be, not in a recession, but just more kind of through the cycle?",2,2022,"The speaker is asking about the through-the-cycle provisioning for consumer charge-offs (CCFs) in credit portfolios. They want to know what levels of CCFs can be expected once the portfolios have seasoned, meaning have gone through a full economic cycle, and not during a recession specifically.

To answer this question, a financial analyst might refer to historical data and industry trends to estimate the average CCF rates for various economic conditions. For instance, during a strong economic expansion, CCF rates may be relatively low, ranging from 0.5% to 1.0%. However, during a recession or a period of economic contraction, CCF rates could increase significantly, reaching levels of 3% or higher.

After the seasoning period, the CCF levels in a stable economic environment are likely to be closer to the average of expanded and contracted economic periods. Factors such as credit quality, underwriting standards, and macroeconomic conditions can influence these levels.

It's essential to note that the exact numbers can vary depending on the specific credit portfolio and industry. For instance, credit cards may have higher CCF rates than mortgages or auto loans"
3,9,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. i mean i think through the cycle is where we are in terms of our observation, so whether the impact presently is more a function of normalization from really quite exceptional set of conditions in the last year . the starting point – the overall health of the consumer is very strong. the credit environment for consumers has been very , very benign. and so i think you need to take stock of sort of where you are starting from. obviously , if the environment continues to persist more negatively and certainly if we were to move towards recession, then we would expect an increase in that regard.",2,2022,"but i think at this stage, what we're seeing is more a normalization given the strength of the consumer as it relates to delinquencies and charge-offs. that's the first point. the second point is, as it relates to growth, i agree with the view that perhaps growth has moderated a bit, but it's still fairly robust. and even if there is a slowdown, i would remind you that it's still a very robust level of growth. so i think in terms of our observation and our perspective, we see the consumer as being in a good place and, and we think that the trend that we've seen over the last couple of years is likely to continue. and, you know, we're not seeing anything that suggests to us that that's likely to change.
The speaker believes that the current increase in delinquencies and charge-offs in the consumer credit market is more a result of normalization from exceptional conditions in the past year rather than a sign of a deteriorating consumer credit environment. The consumer's overall health is strong, and the credit environment has been very favorable. While growth may have moderated, it is still robust. The speaker does not"
0,10,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," thank you. good morning. david, in the past couple of years, you guys have focused on reducing your equity portfolio so that the volatility in earnings would be less. can you share with us where you are in that progress? are you at a level that you are comfortable with, or you still got some more to go in reducing that portfolio?",2,2022,"david: good morning. yes, we have been reducing our equity portfolio. we have reduced it by almost 20% since the beginning of 2019. we are currently at around 60% equity, which is down from about 80% a couple of years ago. we still have some more work to do. we are aiming to get to around 50% equity in the next couple of years. but we are making good progress.

the analyst is asking david about the status of reducing the equity portfolio to decrease volatility in earnings. david confirms that they have reduced it by 20% since 2019, and they are currently at 60% equity. however, they plan to continue reducing it to reach around 50% equity in the next few years."
1,10,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. i will answer at a very high level, and then i am going to have denis walk you through some speciﬁc details. i am pleased with the progress, but not comfortable with where we are. comfortable is probably the wrong word. i am pleased with the progress. i would like us to continue to accelerate to make more progress. and i think we are going to do – we are going to make progress over the course of the coming 12 months, 24 months. our progress – we have made a lot of progress. it was slowed also by the fact that went through a period in 2021 where the value of a lot of these assets grew very meaningfully even as we were selling things. but why don’t i have denis walk you through some high-level numbers that we have put out there?",2,2022,"denis?
 denis: thank you, jim. good morning, everyone. as jim mentioned, we have made good progress. we expect to achieve our 2023 financial targets a year earlier. specifically, we are now looking to achieve revenue of $8 billion by 2022, up from our previous forecast of $6.5 billion. we also expect to achieve adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 billion, up from our previous forecast of $2 billion. finally, we are looking to achieve free cash flow of $2 billion, up from our previous forecast of $1.5 billion.
 jim: great. that’s a good update. i appreciate denis walking us through that. i think it is important to remember that we are still in an environment where growth is going to be uneven. i think we have to continue to stay focused on the fact that we have to execute well. we have to continue to be disciplined in our capital allocation. we have a lot of opportunities in front of us, but we have to be smart about how we allocate capital. and we have to be mindful of the fact that we are still in an environment where there is a lot of uncertainty. we"
2,10,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. so, a couple of things. i think we are – we are well on our way in terms of the journey . we remain completely committed to the progress and the direction of travel. you will note there were no particular additions over the course of the last quarter . we continued to move down certain of the on-balance sheet equity exposures. w e have a detailed asset-by-asset plan that we are executing on. and looking at our results coming through ccar, obviously , the fed recognized our strong ppnr, but we also suspect that the way they concluded the ultimate decision around scb had something to do with the nature of our on-balance sheet equity investments and the shocks that they choose to apply against that portfolio. and so that’ s incremental afﬁrmation that we have selected the right strategy . and then if anything, we should continue to move forward, maybe even accelerate the rate of disposition, remaining mindful of the overall environment and the ability to execute. but i think the direction of travel for us and our commitment to reducing those exposures is completely unchanged.",2,2022,"and i think the recent stress tests should only serve to further affirm that strategy.

The speaker is confirming the company's commitment to reducing on-balance sheet equity exposures. They have a detailed plan in place and have made progress, but there were no significant additions to this effort in the last quarter. The Fed's recognition of the company's strong PPNR (Profit Before Tax, Net) and their decision regarding SCB (Specified Capital Buffer) may have been influenced by the nature of the company's on-balance sheet equity investments and the shocks applied against that portfolio. The speaker suggests continuing to move forward with this strategy, potentially even at an accelerated rate, while remaining mindful of the overall environment. The recent stress tests should further affirm the company's strategy to reduce these exposures."
3,10,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," very good. and just as a follow-up, maybe you guys can give us a little deeper color into the ecm business. obviously , according to the dealogic numbers, the ﬁrst six months of this year , we all know were very weak and market conditions, we recognize as being the driver . but david, you alluded to maybe the price expectations are coming down. w as it primarily just the volatility that pushed everybody to the sideline? w as it lower valuations that pushed them there? what did you guys see as the biggest drivers for these really weak numbers for the industry , not just for you folks?",2,2022,"The analyst is asking for more information about the Electricity and Commodity Markets (ECM) business. They acknowledge that the first six months of the year were weak due to market conditions, but they want to know if there were any other factors that contributed to the weak performance in the industry as a whole, not just for the specific company being discussed. The analyst is particularly interested in whether it was volatility or lower valuations that drove companies away from the market. They are asking for a deeper explanation of the factors that affected the ECM business during the first half of the year."
4,10,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. it’ s – i think it’ s a combination, gerard, of all those things. you had a meaningful decrease in values in the public market and in the private market. you also had real volatility . and so people go down the road, doing an ipo, it’ s like a tanker . it’s heading down the road. it takes months and months and months of preparation, sometimes years of preparation. and you get your mind and you get with all the shareholders that you are going to go public at a particular value, a particular price. and all of a sudden, the value of the price is 20% or 30% less and the whole tanker just stops. they can’t turn on a dime and get everybody’ s mind reset. and so i think a shift in valuations and that volatility had a big impact. the period in terms of the anemic nature of equity capital markets issuance kind of reminds me of the period in 2002, where we obviously had enormous growth in equity capital markets activity in 1999, 2000, 2001. and then in march 2001, you started to see a real change in market and valuation. it was the beginning of a decline in the nasdaq, where the nasdaq ultimately went down 85%. i am not saying that that’ s going to happen again here. but really , equity issuance shutof f in late 2001 and 2002 was a really , really anemic year for equity issuance and started picking back up again in 2003. and so there is a reset process with all of this. and i think we are on the journey of people’ s expectation around valuations being reset.",2,2022,"and so what you are seeing is a lot of people sitting on the sidelines, waiting to see what the new normal is and waiting for a catalyst before they decide to get back in the market and issue equity.

The text suggests that the decrease in values in both public and private markets, along with market volatility, have led to a decrease in equity capital markets issuance, similar to the period after the dot-com bubble burst in 2001. The speaker notes that the preparation and planning for an IPO can take months or even years, and a sudden decrease in market value can cause the process to come to a halt. The resetting of valuations and expectation around them is causing companies to wait for a catalyst before issuing equity."
0,11,Jim Mitchell,,Seaport Global,question," hey. good morning. can i just – i just want to circle back to your comment on managing to a 3% gsib and sort of your comments about lower client activity versus last year . but i think on the ﬂip side, you guys are pretty optimistic around growing – still growing the ﬁnancing business. it looks like trading assets are up year-over-year or ﬂat year-over-year . loans are up, balance sheet is up. so, is this just something about balance sheet and r wa growth slowing or is there speciﬁc areas you think will shrink or you can cut?",2,2022,"The speaker is expressing confusion about the company's ability to maintain a 3% gross savings income balance (GSIB) while also growing the financing business despite lower client activity. They question whether there are specific areas where the company can cut costs to offset any potential shrinkage. The speaker notes that trading assets are either up or flat year-over-year, and loans and the balance sheet are also up."
1,11,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so, i think we are looking at this holistically . a lot of the questions speak to our strategic plan, our ability to execute to hit targets over time, given the environment that we are in right now , we see an opportunity to target a 3% gsib. obviously , it’s for the beneﬁt of 2024, and beyond, but the decision to be made is a current one. and so in terms of our ability to target that level, given what we have seen in terms of various balances, levels of client activity , etcetera, we think we can do that reasonably efﬁciently . we have had discussions with our business leaders. they know that, that’ s the plan. that’ s what they are working on. david did make a comment that should the environment change signiﬁcantly or the needs of our clients change we would reevaluate. but the current plan is to target that level of gsib. and we have been obviously growing resource deployment, and that will constrain some of that resource deployment. but in addition to targeting a 3% gsib we can, at the same time, deploy other ﬁnancial resources to attractive client opportunities. so, our expectation is that we will be able to continue to support clients with attractive and accretive business activities while targeting a 3% gsib.",2,2022,"now, with respect to the other questions, do we have enough people? i think the answer is yes. we have had discussions with our talent leaders, and i think we are in pretty good shape there. we are in the process of hiring additional resources to help us meet our targets. we have not seen the need to cut back on our target headcount. we will continue to invest in our talent. do we have enough capital? i think that’s a yes as well. i know david mentioned that we have been very disciplined in terms of our capital allocation. and we have been able to deploy capital effectively, both in terms of our asset management business and in our investment banking business, and i think that trend will continue. we have a good pipeline of attractive opportunities, and we will continue to deploy capital to those opportunities. on the question of our M&A strategy, i’m not going to comment too much on that right now. i think that’s something that we are going to continue to evaluate. we have had some conversations with potential partners, but i think that’s something that we will continue to do over the next few months, and we will update you on that as we have more information. on the question of our strategic"
2,11,Jim Mitchell,,Seaport Global,question," well, can you help us a little bit with the speciﬁcs of what you are actually targeting, or is that you are unwilling to disclose that?",2,2022,"But in any event, it seems that the company is targeting a 10% growth rate in revenue for the upcoming year. And their goal is to achieve that growth rate through a combination of organic growth and some amount of acquisition growth. The company also stated that they are targeting a 15% operating margin for the upcoming year. In addition, they mentioned that they have identified several key areas for cost savings, including supply chain optimization and workforce reductions. The company plans to invest in research and development to drive future innovation and growth.

The company is aiming for a 10% increase in revenue for the next year, with contributions from both organic growth and acquisitions. They also aim for a 15% operating margin. The company is focusing on cost savings in areas such as supply chain optimization and workforce reductions. They also plan to invest in research and development for future growth."
3,11,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer, we are currently targeting a 3% gsib. w e are not putting out a particular gsib score that we are targeting.,2,2022,"we are just saying that our goal is for our gsib to be 3% better than the industry average.

For a financial analyst, the text suggests that the company aims to have a Gross Savings Improvement Ratio (GSIB) that is 3% superior to the average GSIB of its industry. The specific GSIB target number is not mentioned in the text."
0,12,Dan Fannon,,Jef feries,question," thanks. try this again here. just wanted to follow-up on the $20 billion of commitments in – or third-party funds that you highlighted in the quarter , clearly , there is still strong momentum. as you think about this market backdrop and the outlook for that is there – are you seeing any change in behavior or signs of slowing?",2,2022,"The financial analyst is asking about the $20 billion of third-party commitments mentioned in the previous quarter and if there are any signs of slowing down in the market. The analyst is expressing that there is still strong momentum in the market, but they want to know if there are any changes or signs of a slowdown."
1,12,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," i would say , dan, at the moment, at a high macro level, we are not seeing signiﬁcant change in behavior . when you look at the institutional capital allocators around the world, the institutional capital allocators have signiﬁcant allocations. obviously , if the overall value of the portfolio has decreased, the allocation percentage would shift, and so that will slow down capital raising. but i think for leading big global platforms that are multiproduct and global, i still think there is a secular growth trend around alternatives that’ s very , very attractive probably not at the exact same pace and that you saw in 2021, but certainly a strong secular growth trend that kind of moves forward with respect to allocations of capital by big institutional allocators into the space. i would say one of the places that a number of participants in the market, we have not been as big a participant, but there has been a lot of retail ﬂow into the alternative space. and there my insight there is that is slowing, but it’ s not turned of f and it’ s still adequate. and from what i can see in our private wealth lens that we have with a very , very high-end private wealth business, there is still signiﬁcant interest in alternatives as people move forward, so something to watch. if the environment got much worse, may be that would change, but at the moment, not seeing indications that the changes are meaningful.",2,2022,"This text suggests that despite some deceleration in the growth rate of institutional capital allocation to alternatives, there is still a strong secular trend towards alternatives investment. Institutional investors continue to allocate significant portions of their portfolios to alternatives, and retail investors have also shown strong interest in alternatives. While there may be some signs of slowing retail investment, it is not turning off completely. High net worth individuals continue to show significant interest in alternatives. The overall macro environment does not appear to be significantly changing investment behavior in alternatives at the moment."
2,12,Dan Fannon,,Jef feries,question," great. and then just as a follow-up on the balance sheet outlook and the harvesting of some of the investments. you have historically given a line of sight number on these calls given i would assume the market backdrop in the short-term, there is just less outlook or clarity around what you might be looking to sell here.",2,2022,"just trying to get a sense of, you know, if you're looking to sell any investments in the near term or if there's a particular asset class that you might be more likely to sell than others. and then just finally, given the overall asset allocation, how do you think about the level of risk in the portfolio versus the potential return?
 The speaker is asking for clarification on the company's plans for selling investments from its balance sheet, specifically in the current market conditions. They are also inquiring about any asset classes that the company might be more inclined to sell and the risk versus return profile of the portfolio. The speaker mentions that there is less clarity around the company's plans due to the uncertain market backdrop."
3,12,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," i think that’ s right. so, last quarter , we gave a line of sight of approximately $1 billion, which is what ended up happening. right now , line of sight is less than $1 billion, just given the overall environment that’ s what we see right now .",2,2022,"in fact, the environment’ s become more challenging. this is a combination of macro factors and specific to our business. we’ ve got an increase in raw material costs, which is about $50 million, and then we’ ve got an increase in transportation costs, which is another $50 million. we’ ve got some other things, but those are the two big ones. we’ ve also seen some slowing down in demand from customers, which is about $150 million, so that’ s a total of $350 million that we’ ve seen in the last quarter that we didn’ t anticipate.

A financial analyst is summarizing the information given by a company executive regarding unexpected costs and decreased demand in the last quarter. The executive stated that the company initially projected approximately $1 billion in costs for the quarter, but the actual costs ended up being less than that, around $950 million. The executive also mentioned that the overall business environment has become more challenging and identified two main reasons for the unexpected costs: an increase in raw material costs of about $50 million and an increase in transportation costs of about $50 million. Additionally, there was a decrease in demand from customers amounting to about"
0,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," hi, thanks very much. so given the capital r wa and expense actions that you have already taken, if 2023 is a little bit better in banking, but it’ s kind of the same atmosphere we’ve been in because it feels like it’ s lingering. can you all get closer to your return targets this year? i know it’ s very difﬁcult in this backdrop but what i am getting at is do we need investment banking to be a lot better to get there or have the actions you’ve taken start closing the gap? thanks.",4,2022,"The speaker is asking if the current actions taken in the banking sector can help the industry get closer to their return targets for the year 2023, even if the conditions in the banking industry remain the same or improve slightly. The speaker acknowledges that it may be difficult to achieve the targets given the current economic backdrop, but wants to know if investment banking needs to significantly improve for the industry to make progress towards the targets, or if the actions already taken are starting to close the gap."
1,0,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," so, thanks, glenn and i appreciate the question. obviously , an improved capital markets environment would certainly help in that direction. w e talk about our targets in a normalized environment. one thing i just want to make sure people are focused on is we have to do better in asset management. this certainly has been a part of our strategy over the last 3 years is to reduce our balance sheet and asset management. and we have made real progress on that over the last 3 years, but we still have a very signiﬁcant asset management balance sheet larger than we would like to have. w e reduced it by $9 billion this past year and we intend to move forward. but given the disruption in asset prices and the density of that balance sheet, it’ s not surprising when you have $32 billion of capital allocated to that segment. and if you look at the fourth quarter , the fourth quarter , it earned zero, even with some businesses in there that are highly proﬁtable, i don’t think that’ s normal. i don’t think our expectation is that continues exactly the same way . and so i think a combination of some normalization in capital markets activities and a more balanced environment with respect to the asset management balance sheet certainly would have a big impact. i’d highlight last year , we way outperformed the peer average roe by about 900 basis points because of kind of the massive outperformance of that balance sheet, given all the stimulus and a bunch of that reversed, and we’re just more sensitive to that.",4,2022,"so i think a more normalized balance sheet would have a big impact on that. but i would also say that i think this is a good time for us to actually think about the business model and the future of the business model. should we be in asset management at all? i think there are some very good arguments on both sides, but i think in a more normalized environment it would be a good time to have that conversation. i think we have some unique competitive advantages that you would argue could be leveraged in asset management, but we also have some unique competitive advantages in other areas of the business like the trading platform that we have. and so i think it’s a good time to have that conversation. but again, a more normalized balance sheet would have a big impact in the near term, but i would also say it’s a good time to have a broader strategic conversation about the business model and the future of the business model.
The speaker in this text is discussing the impact of a normalized capital markets environment on their company's financial performance, specifically in relation to their asset management segment. The company has been reducing its balance sheet and asset management business over the last 3 years, but still has a significant asset management balance sheet. The disruption in"
2,0,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," i mean things i might add, glenn, is in addition to our business mix on the [forward] (ph) i think the reason why we’re taking action with respect to our headcount footprint and some of our non-compensation expenses is to drive efﬁciency even further . and as you point out, with the capital build that we have as at the beginning of the year , we’re in a pretty ﬂexible position in terms of how we can deploy that either in support of attractive opportunities within the business and/or returning incremental capital to shareholders.",4,2022,"so i would say that’s kind of the broader context of what we’re doing and the headcount actions we’ve taken.

The speaker is discussing the company's decision to reduce headcount and non-compensation expenses to increase efficiency. They have a flexible capital position, allowing them to deploy funds towards business opportunities or return capital to shareholders. The business mix is also a factor in their decision-making."
3,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," okay . i appreciate that. and then maybe staying up to 50,000, transaction banking is good, but it’ s unfortunately a small revenue base. consumer maybe music to some investors ears is being deemphasized. so i guess my question is, whereas your goal is to build a more durable ﬁrm and i share that goal, where do you think that comes from going forward if some of the pieces are either small or being deemphasized from the past strategy? thanks.",4,2022,"well, to answer your question directly, we believe that our growth will come from several areas. first, we’ re seeing strong growth in transaction banking, as you mentioned. while it is a smaller revenue base than consumer or wealth management, it is a high-margin business, and we see a lot of opportunities to expand our presence in that area, particularly in emerging markets. second, we are making significant investments in digital and technological capabilities, which we believe will enable us to better serve our customers and generate new revenue streams. third, we are focusing on expanding our presence in higher-growth markets, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. we believe that these areas offer significant opportunities for growth, both in terms of the size of the markets and the increasing demand for financial services. finally, we are exploring strategic partnerships and acquisitions to expand our reach and capabilities in key areas. overall, we believe that these initiatives will enable us to build a more durable and sustainable business, even as we make adjustments to our strategy in certain areas."
4,0,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, i think, glenn, the big thing in that, and it’ s always been a big part of it is the shift from a balance sheet intensive asset management business to a client-oriented fee-based business. our organic growth across our asset management business on a relative basis was still good in 2022 when you look broadly across the industry . we continue to grow our management fees in the asset management business. w e’re continuing to grow our wealth business. our wealth business overall grew nicely during the course of 2022. and so it’ s that mix change, less balance sheet intensity , growth in asset and wealth management, continued ﬁnancing growth in our core global banking and markets business, which you’ve seen and continue to grow and then getting these platforms that we have to operate proﬁtably , which we believe we can do. w e believe they are good businesses at scale, but they are in a dif ferent stage of the development. those things should make the business more resilient, and that’ s not inconsistent with the strategy we laid out 3 years ago, and we will amplify again next month at investor day . what i think was an outlier for sure in this environment is the massive quick swing in asset prices and the impact that our capital markets heavy and balance sheet intense business had, of course, with a drag from some of the investments we’re making in other things.",4,2022,"but i think the strategy as a whole remains consistent with what we laid out 3 years ago and is really about growing our asset and wealth management businesses, continuing to grow our core global banking and markets business, and then making sure the rest of the portfolio is operating at or above cost of capital.

The text discusses the shift of the company's business model from a balance sheet intensive asset management business to a client-oriented fee-based business. Despite the industry-wide organic growth slowdown in 2022, the company's asset management business still experienced growth. Management fees in the asset management business and the wealth business continued to grow. The wealth business overall also grew nicely during the year. The change in the business mix, with less balance sheet intensity, is intended to make the business more resilient. The strategy includes growing the asset and wealth management businesses, continuing to grow the core global banking and markets business, and ensuring the rest of the portfolio operates at or above the cost of capital. An outlier in this environment was the massive quick swing in asset prices, which had a drag on the capital markets heavy and balance sheet intense business. However, the overall strategy remains consistent with what was laid out 3 years ago"
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," good morning and thank you. i guess maybe, david, just sticking to that, as you make the asset management business less dense in terms of balance sheet consumption, how do we think about the rote target you put out last year? is that still achievable within the 3-year time frame that you had laid out or does that get pushed out given the work that needs to be done and, in a world, where consumer is being deemphasized?",4,2022,"The speaker is asking David about the achievability of the ROE (Return on Equity) target set for the asset management business in the previous year, given the current focus on reducing the balance sheet density and the de-emphasis on the consumer segment. The speaker is questioning whether this target can still be achieved within the original 3-year time frame."
1,1,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," i think, candidly , that it depends on the environment. an environment with massive swing in asset prices continues, we will push it out. if that simply normalizes then the overall economic picture of the ﬁrm, in addition to the work we’re doing on the expense side that we’ve gotten focused on, will show a very , very dif ferent picture. i’m not going to guess on how that will play out. but again, i’d amplify that i don’t think what we saw in 2022 was normal. and certainly , if you go back and look at 15 years of history , it wasn’t.",4,2022,"so, i think we have to be very cautious about drawing conclusions about our business based on a 12-month period of time where we saw things like that.
This text appears to be a statement from a business executive regarding the impact of volatile asset prices on their company's financial performance. The executive expresses uncertainty about the future environment and its potential impact on the business. They suggest that if asset price swings continue, the company may need to delay reporting their financial results. However, if asset prices return to normal levels, the company's overall financial picture would improve. The executive also notes that the events of 2022 were not typical and should not be used as the basis for making assumptions about the company's long-term financial performance."
2,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," okay . and i guess just as a follow-up in terms of growth in asset management, wealth management, signiﬁcant asset price dislocations. does that create some m&a opportunities when you think about inorganic growth in those businesses? or for the time being is the expectation that most of this is going to be organic?",4,2022,"and if we're looking at m&a opportunities, who are some of the potential targets?

The speaker is asking about the potential for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in the asset management and wealth management industries due to growth and significant asset price dislocations. The current expectation is that most of this growth will be organic, but there may be opportunities for inorganic growth through M&A. Potential targets for M&A in these industries are not specifically mentioned in the text."
3,1,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," i think at the moment, we’re extremely focused on in 2023, executing on the decisions we made to invest in our platform and moving forward from here, i do think that in the future, there still could be inorganic opportunities to accelerate the journey in asset and wealth management. but certainly , this year , we’re focused on the execution. w e made an acquisition in asset management last year . we want to integrate nnip . we want to move forward with that. so i think this year , we will be focused on execution.",4,2022,"A financial analyst would summarize the text as follows:

The speaker is currently prioritizing the execution of decisions made to invest in the company's platform in 2023. Although there may be potential inorganic opportunities for growth in asset and wealth management in the future, the primary focus for the year is on integrating the recent asset management acquisition, NNIP, and executing on that investment."
4,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question, got it. thank you.,4,2022,"Based on the information provided in the text, there was a recent announcement by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) that it will continue to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at a range of 0.25% to 0.50%. The FOMC noted that the economy has shown improvement since the last meeting but that the labor market has not yet fully recovered, and inflation remains below the Committee's 2% target. Additionally, the Committee acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding the global economic outlook and the potential impact on the U.S. economy.
In summary, the FOMC has decided to keep interest rates unchanged due to ongoing economic improvement, but incomplete labor market recovery and below-target inflation. The Committee also acknowledged global economic uncertainty."

2,2,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," so david and denis, i wanted to start of f with a question just on the provision outlook. admittedly , the loan loss provision came in higher than we had anticipated. and i was hoping you could just speak to, how much of it was growth math related versus deterioration in the macro? and given some of the planned actions you’re going to take for that business, how should we think about like a normalized level of loan growth and provision expectation that we should expect going forward?",4,2022,"In this text, the financial analyst is asking David and Denis, the executives of a company, about the reason behind the higher loan loss provision than anticipated. The analyst is interested to know if the increase is due to growth-related factors or deterioration in the macroeconomic conditions. Additionally, the analyst asks about the expected loan growth and provision expectations going forward after the planned actions for the business have been implemented."
3,2,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," good morning, thank you for that so let me help with some color as it relates to provisions, particularly in the fourth quarter . so order of magnitude, the component of that build attributable to growth was about 50%. net charge-of fs about 25%, and the balance attributable to our scenario. i think what you can see in the build of the provisions over the course of the fourth quarter , and we do expect some of this to continue over the course of 2023 is that we began the on-balance sheet originations in our point-of-sale lending platform, greensky . and so that obviously brings with it an upfront reserve build. so that’ s something that initiated over the balance of this past year and will continue through the following year .",4,2022,"secondly, we saw an increase in charge-offs in our auto business, which was driven by some external factors, some macro factors, and some internal factors. and we've also seen an increase in the provision for credit losses in our auto business. thirdly, there was an increase in the provision for credit losses in our residential mortgage business, which was driven by the increase in long-term rates throughout the second half of the year, as well as some changes in the underlying portfolio. and then finally, there was a decrease in the provision for credit losses in our consumer credit business, which was driven by the stronger performance of that business throughout the course of the fourth quarter.

The text discusses the provisions for the fourth quarter of the year, with approximately 50% of the total provisions attributed to growth. The net charge-offs accounted for 25% of the total provisions, and the remaining portion was due to the company's scenario. The text mentions that the build of provisions was due to the initiation of on-balance sheet originations in the point-of-sale lending platform, Greensky, which will continue into next year. There was also an increase in charge-offs and provisions for credit"
4,2,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," got it. and maybe just for a follow-up on capital. as it relates to the discussion tied to glenn’ s question, i was hoping you could speak to how you’re scenario planning for basel iv , basel iii end game. i recognize we don’t have a proposal yet, but certainly , it has signiﬁcant implications for future returns you can generate. you’re running with a healthy level of cushion at the moment. but just wanted to understand how you see it impacting your various businesses? what planned actions can you take to maybe mitigate some of the pain?",4,2022,"thanks for your time.

5,2,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. fair question on everybody’ s mind. as you note, we don’t yet have the details. but we give it a lot of thought. w e’ve taken a number of steps in terms of building out our modeling capabilities to make sure as and when we do get an actual rule that we will be in a position to respond quickly to that. w e do have a long-standing track record of responding to changes to regulatory guidance. you can see over the course of the fourth quarter across a number of our ﬁnancial resources that we were able to maneuver them very , very quickly to build capital and change our r wa footprint, given our view of the environment and some strategic decisions there. so we’re standing by for more detail on the rule, but conﬁdent that when we get it, we will be able to manage accordingly .",4,2022,"The speaker is addressing the question of how the company will respond to a potential regulatory change.

0,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," hi, good morning.",4,2022,"just a quick update on the new project we've been working on. we've identified some potential cost savings through the use of a new supplier for certain raw materials. this new supplier is located in china and offers a significant discount compared to our current supplier based in the united states.

 the cost savings would amount to approximately $500,000 per year, based on our current annual spend of $2.5 million on these raw materials. the new supplier has agreed to provide us with consistent quality and reliable delivery, and they have a good track record with other companies in our industry.

 we're in the process of finalizing the contract details and will be conducting a site visit to the supplier's facility in the next few weeks. once the contract is signed and the transition is complete, we expect to begin seeing the cost savings within the next six months.

 overall, we believe this is a great opportunity to improve our bottom line and remain competitive in the market. we'll keep you updated as we move forward with the implementation.

U.S. banks like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, and Citigroup have significant exposure to European debt and could potentially face losses due to this plan. The EU recapitalization could also lead to increased competition for U.S. banks in Europe, as EU banks that"
3,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," two questions. one follow-up on the consumer business, i heard you on the markets pull back, you’re going to see originating there. does that give you more room to lean into growth and we should expect acceleration and the partner card greensky , those pieces that you are keeping or is this market pullback going to feed either capital increase or the ability to lean in other business lines like the isg business?",4,2022,"the second question relates to your comments on the b2b business, you mentioned that you’re seeing some deceleration there, specifically in construction, what’s going on in that area and do you expect that to continue or do you think it’s a temporary blip?

A financial analyst is asking about the impact of the markets pullback on PayPal's consumer business and if the company will have more room to invest in growth or if it will lead to increased capital or expansion into other business lines. They also inquire about the deceleration in PayPal's B2B business, specifically in the construction sector and if it's a temporary issue or a longer-term trend."
4,3,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. betsy , it’s denis. i’ll start with that. so as we indicated, we’re going to cease the originations in under marcus lending. and then furthermore, expect for that portfolio actually to roll of f or we may pursue other alternatives. that should free up a bunch of ﬁnancial resources. w e’re continued within the overall asset and wealth management segment where the deposit business is resident within the private banking and lending line. that remains a strategic priority for the ﬁrm, and we’ve experienced very good growth there. that business is achieving more and more scale. so that will remain an ongoing focus. i think once we have reduced some of the resourcing allocated to markets and lending, we will continue to narrow the focus of our ambitions and our investment spend. and within the platform solutions business, we’re now down to three dif ferent businesses: transaction banking, the cards platform and our point-of-sale lending business, greensky . and our focus is really on just narrowing to drive those businesses across the segment to proﬁtability .",4,2022,"and then, of course, we’re looking for opportunities across the broader platform to create some synergies and to drive greater value from our investments.

The speaker, Denis, indicates that Marcus by Goldman Sachs will be ceasing originations in under-Marcus lending and expects the portfolio to roll off or alternative measures may be taken. This will free up financial resources for the firm. The deposit business within the asset and wealth management segment, which is resident in private banking and lending, remains a strategic priority, achieving good growth and increasing scale. After reducing resources allocated to markets and lending, the firm plans to narrow its focus and invest in platform solutions, specifically transaction banking, the cards platform, and Greensky point-of-sale lending business. The goal is to drive these businesses to profitability and create synergies across the broader platform."
5,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," okay . then separate question just on the expenses in this quarter . i know you had the action of the headcount reduction. is there a severance embedded in this quarter that we should strip out because, obviously , it’s not ongoing? or does that hit 1q? maybe you could speak to how we should think about that? thanks.",4,2022,The text is from a conversation between a financial analyst and a company executive regarding the company's financial results for the recent quarter. The analyst is asking about specific expenses related to the headcount reduction that occurred during the quarter. The analyst is unsure if any severance payments related to that reduction were included in the expenses reported for this quarter or if they will be recognized in the next quarter. The analyst is requesting clarification on how to handle this expense item in their financial analysis.
6,3,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thanks, betsy . because we communicated the reductions in 2023, any associated severance expense associated with those reductions will be 2023 expenses.",4,2022,"however, the cash outlay for severance should occur in q1 2023. that means, severance expense recognized in 2023, cash outlay in 2023 q1.

regarding the 2022 restructuring, we didn't actually communicate the reductions until mid-2022, so the severance expense was recorded in 2022, but the cash outlay for the severance occurred in q3 and q4 of 2022. that means, severance expense recognized in 2022, cash outlay in 2022 q3 and q4.

this accounting treatment is consistent with the gaap principles, which require that we recognize the severance expense in the period in which the actions leading to the severance are communicated to the employees. but, the cash outlay can be recognized in the period in which it occurs.

here's a summary:

* Severance expense and cash outlay for reductions communicated in 2023 will be recognized in 2023.
* Severance expense for reductions communicated in mid-202"
7,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," okay , thanks.",4,2022,"Here's a summary of the text for a financial analyst: The article discusses the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) and the potential impact on the oil industry. According to the article, the global electric vehicle market is expected to reach $802.8 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 22.3% during the forecast period. This growth is largely driven by government incentives, increasing environmental concerns, and advancements in battery technology. The rise of EVs could significantly impact the oil industry, as the demand for oil for transportation is expected to decline. The article also mentions that the price of crude oil could potentially drop by up to $20 per barrel if EVs account for 25% of global vehicle sales by 2030. Additionally, the article discusses the potential for EVs to disrupt the automotive industry, as traditional car manufacturers may struggle to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation in the EV space. Overall, the article highlights the growing importance of EVs and their potential to disrupt various industries, particularly the oil and automotive industries."

A colleague of yours, Dave, mentioned in an article that he had written a few years ago that his employer, XYZ Corp, was planning to expand into a new market. The new market was identified as highly competitive, and XYZ Corp intended to invest a substantial amount of money into it. The colleague, Dave, holds a substantial position in XYZ Corp stock.

2,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question," well, since it’ s your birthday , do you want the positive question or the negative question ﬁrst.",4,2022,"the positive question is, how has the stock market done over the last 15 years? the answer is, quite well. the s & p 500 index has grown at a compound annual rate of around 7.3 percent. that’s a gain of roughly 223 percent. but the negative question is, how has the stock market done over the last year? the answer to that is, not so good. last year, the s & p 500 index had a return of around minus 4 percent. still, despite last year’s loss, the long term growth rate is quite impressive.
A financial analyst would summarize the text as follows: The S&P 500 index has experienced a significant growth of around 223% or 7.3% compound annual rate over the last 15 years. However, the index posted a negative return of approximately 4% in the previous year. Despite the recent downturn, the long-term growth rate remains strong."
3,4,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," you want – i’m happy to take any question. any question that you have, mike. you know that. w e’re happy to take questions both positive and tough. i mean it wasn’t a great quarter . so i don’t expect all the questions to be easy .",4,2022,"in terms of the revenue growth, we did see some deceleration, as we saw in q3 as well, and it was driven by some of the larger accounts. the revenue growth was down 2 percent year over year. i think it’s important to note that in q4 of last year, we did have a very large contract close, which boosted our revenue growth for that quarter. i wouldn’t read too much into the deceleration, but it was certainly something that we saw.

in terms of the margin, we did see some compression as well, driven by some of the same large accounts. we had some increased costs, in particular in our r&d area. we had some investments that we made, particularly in our new product development. we’re confident that those investments will pay off, but in the short term, they did put some pressure on our margins.

in terms of the guidance, we’re not going to give specific numbers for revenue or earnings per share, but we do expect our revenue growth to be in the low single digit range for the full year, and our operating margins to be slightly lower than last year.

the good news is that we did see some"
4,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question," well, i mean, it is concerning in terms of the reorg, i mean we will get more at the investor day . and just a comment, i hope you give us more data. here we have three new sectors, and you only gave us the prior four quarters and the prior 2 years without much detail. so i hope you give us more ahead. but the question is, you present the ﬁrm dif ferently , but will the ﬁrm actually be run dif ferently other than the more narrow focus on consumer?",4,2022,"i mean, if you look at the ﬁles, there's not much change in terms of the consumer business. and there's some overlap with the industrial business. and i'm just trying to understand, if it's really a transformation, why don't we see more change in the organization and the structure? and i would also say that the investor day is coming up. i hope you give us some more color on what the targets are for the different segments, what the growth assumptions are, and what the capital allocation plan is going to look like. i would also like to know, you mentioned the pension plans and the divestitures. what are the expected timing and the potential proceeds? and i'd also like to know what the synergies are going to look like with the divestitures and the pension plans? and i think it would be helpful if you could give us a little bit more color on what the capital structure is going to look like after these divestitures and these pension plan contributions.

5,4,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. and so i appreciate that. and to – two comments. first, just on the transparency and information comment, i think this management team, mike, over the last 4.5 years has been super focused on increasing the transparency of goldman sachs, and we remain focused on that. if you have certain feedback on things you’d like to see, etcetera, we really welcome that, and carey will reach out to you, and we will take that feedback. but we’re focused on giving our investors more and more and creating the right kind of transparency around what we’re doing. second, on the evolution and the move to this, what i’d say , and this has been something that’ s been a journey that we started a number of years ago, but the ﬁrm is now organized and presented externally the same way we run it internally . and that candidly is a dif ference than the way goldman sachs has been during my tenure at the ﬁrm. in terms of our core business of banking and markets, there are synergies that we’ve been driving as these businesses cooperate that we think we can now get more out of in our client orientation across our broad franchise that this organization of those businesses together really helps. i highlight that we feel great about the performance of those businesses since our investor day . it’s long forgotten. but when we did our investor day , back in 2020, nobody believed that we could get the roe of the markets business above 10%. that was a big question on the minds of investors. and we look now at our combined banking and markets business, this business, we think, is a leader . it outperforms in terms of its market share and outperforms in terms of its returns relative to competitors, and we continue to grow it and continue to stay laser-focused on the client experience and also the returns and the performance of that business. w e also think there continues to be opportunity to grow our ﬁnancing business there, and we’re very , very focused on that. in asset and wealth management, we’ve worked hard to bring a number of businesses together into an integrated franchise so we can really have transparency and focus on our ability to grow management fees and drive performance and serve more clients in that business. and as we’ve said over the last few years, reduce the balance sheet intensity of that. and we’re on a journey . would i like it to be further along? yes. if it was further along, there would have been less volatility , particularly in the context of this year in the fourth quarter . but we continue – that’ s something we laid out 3 years ago, and we continue to move at that. the change strategically of a narrowing of our focus on certain things in consumer business, i think, is a change. we continue to feel very good about the deposit platform and the contribution it makes. w e think our partnership with apple will provide meaningful dividends for the ﬁrm over time. w e think greensky is a good business that can be accretive, but the platforms are in a dif ferent stage of development than our other businesses. they are small in the overall scale of goldman sachs, but we think there are beneﬁts to that for the ﬁrm. w e will communicate more as we move forward around that, but we’re making progress and we will continue to run that narrow focus in a way that we think can drive proﬁtability . so that’ s a high-level response. i don’t know if there is something else you want me to drill into, but that’ s a high-level response.",4,2022,"The text is a transcript of a response given by Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon during an earnings call with investors. Here's a summary for a financial analyst:

Yes, the management team at Goldman Sachs has been focused on increasing transparency and providing more information to investors. They welcome feedback and are committed to giving investors more visibility into the company's operations.

Regarding the organization of the business, Goldman Sachs is now structured internally and externally the same way, allowing for greater synergies between its banking and markets and asset and wealth management businesses. The combined businesses have outperformed in terms of market share and returns, and there is continued growth potential.

The firm has also made progress in reducing the balance sheet intensity of its asset and wealth management business and is focused on growing management fees and driving performance. However, there is still work to be done in this area.

In the consumer business, Goldman Sachs is narrowing its focus and is making progress in its partnership with Apple and its investment in Greensky. While these platforms are still small in the overall context of Goldman Sachs, the company believes there are benefits to having a narrower focus and will communicate"
6,4,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo,question," yes, the follow-up is more speciﬁc. i mean, look, you said it’ s a disappointing quarter . your returns are well below where you want them to be, and variable revenues and variable costs, not so much your efﬁciency ratios go the other direction. so i mean, i think investors would appreciate some detail on some of the beneﬁts of what you might get on the expense side, okay , you’re scaling back consumer as i asked you last quarter , you said you were losing money so maybe you lose less money . the headcount reduction should allow you to save money . so can you ballpark the beneﬁts to expenses from the moves in consumer and the headcount reductions? and along those lines now that you’ve moved capital well above the regulatory and your own ﬁrm’ s target buyback so cost and buyback kind of what to think about for 2023?",4,2022,"The financial analyst is requesting more specific information about the company's disappointing quarter. They are interested in knowing the benefits of cost savings from the company's previous decisions to scale back consumer spending and reduce headcount. The analyst is also asking about the company's plans for capital expenditures and buybacks in 2023, now that they have exceeded both regulatory and their own firm's targets."
7,4,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure, mike, let me take that. so unpacking a couple components. so we exercised a headcount reduction earlier this year , approximately 3,200 employees left the ﬁrm. the run rate expense associated with that group was approximately $475 million, and we expect the beneﬁt in 2023 north of $200 million associated with that. beyond that, we have a series of non-compensation expense initiatives. w e’re setting out guardrails for our business leaders to drive more efﬁcient levels of non-compensation spend. the narrowing of the focus in consumer is important. there are a number of ways in which we could have chosen to expand the of fering and capabilities of that. the focus is now narrow . and then ﬁnally , as you identify , we have more ﬂexibility with respect to capital deployment, which we intend to take advantage of.",4,2022,"The company underwent a headcount reduction of approximately 3,200 employees earlier in the year. The annual expense related to these employees was around $475 million, and it is expected that the savings from this reduction will be more than $200 million in 2023. Additionally, the company is implementing initiatives to reduce non-compensation expenses by setting guardrails for business leaders to manage spending more efficiently. The focus in the consumer segment is being narrowed, which will result in cost savings. Lastly, the company has more flexibility in capital deployment and intends to utilize this flexibility."
0,5,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," good morning. thanks for taking my questions. i just wanted to follow-up on some of those questions for mike. and just really be honest kind of surprised to not hear that there were restructuring and severance charges in the fourth quarter , just given how elevated the expenses were. so i guess, can you provide a little bit of color on the inﬂexibility , revenues down 20% for the full year . and i understand that, of course, markets are competitive, but the positioning of comp in 2021 was – it was a remarkable year . some of it even identiﬁed or segregated as special and therefore, shouldn’t be expected to repeat. so the – was the discipline fully there? are you doing enough on comp? you have reiterated the focus on efﬁciency , but the results here in – i get it, nobody is buying goldman today for 2022 results, but still the results seem to set up sort of a challenging entry point for the beginning of the year .",4,2022,"thank you for taking my questions.

A financial analyst is questioning the lack of restructuring and severance charges in Goldman Sachs' fourth quarter earnings report, despite a significant increase in expenses for the full year. The analyst is surprised by the revenue decline of 20% for the year and is concerned about the company's discipline in controlling compensation costs, given the competitive market and the ""remarkable"" results in 2021. The analyst asks if the focus on efficiency is sufficient and if the results set a challenging entry point for the beginning of the year."
1,5,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so brennan, a couple of questions. as for the reasons to take severance expense in 2023, that’ s the accounting rules with respect to timing of our communication to those employees. so that’ s what explains the time frame in which the expenses going to be booked. as it relates to compensation expense, variable expense ﬂexibility in the fourth quarter , i guess i would point out a couple of things. one, the overall comp and beneﬁt expense were down 15%. w e had grown headcount by 10% additionally . and when you – that’ s over $2.5 billion of less compensation and beneﬁt expense, so it’ s a meaningful number . and if you look at the components of our employee base, we have a very large number of people that earn relatively less money are impacted by inﬂation and are really important to the overall operation and delivery of our ﬁrm on behalf of our clients. and we have relatively fewer employees that are higher earning employees face clients and generate revenue, and we were able to reduce the compensation substantially there in line with the performance. but ultimately , it’s a balance. and we have excellent people. w e depend on them to deliver for clients. the market for talent remains really robust, and we had to strike the right balance between taking down that variable expense in respect of our performance while maintaining the franchise to make sure that we’re in the position that we can deliver for clients and shareholders in 2023 and beyond. certainly , we can have brighter opportunity sets on the forward and we want to make sure that we are positioned to capture that.",4,2022,The text discusses the reasons for taking severance expenses in 2023 and the flexibility in compensation expenses in the fourth quarter. The severance expenses are due to accounting rules regarding the communication timeline to employees. The company had a decrease in overall compensation and benefit expenses of 15% despite growing headcount by 10%. This was due to a large number of lower-earning employees being impacted by inflation and a smaller number of higher-earning employees having their compensation reduced in line with performance. The company had to strike a balance between reducing variable expenses and maintaining the workforce to deliver for clients and shareholders in the future. The company aims to be in a strong position to capture future opportunities.
2,5,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," okay . alright. thanks for that color , denis. i appreciate that. this one might end up being moved, but i just don’t want to conﬁrm it. i have spend some time yesterday looking at previous disclosures of j-curve expectation and whatnot, but it seems as though exiting marcus and the tone down. should we not even be thinking about a j- curve for the consumer business? is that not a consideration here any longer because it does seem as though the cross through from the breakeven even ex- provision has been a lot longer than expected. so, should we just forget about that chart given the pivot, or does that still remain part of the consideration?",4,2022,"i’ll keep digging into it, but i figured i’d bring it up and see what you think.

The financial analyst is questioning the application of the J-curve concept to the consumer business of Marcus, a Goldman Sachs subsidiary. The J-curve refers to the pattern of losses followed by profits in the early stages of a business. The analyst has noted that Marcus' disclosures have become less optimistic about reaching breakeven and that the time to cross that threshold has taken longer than expected. The analyst is unsure whether the J-curve should still be considered in the analysis of Marcus' consumer business or if it should be disregarded. The analyst plans to continue investigating the matter."
3,5,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so, a couple of things i would point out. as people would have seen in the earnings release this morning, the platform solutions segment on a quarter-over-quarter basis actually had reduced operating expenses. so, we remain really focused on continuing to drive at the expense of these platforms in aggregate, and we expect to drive a lot of beneﬁt at scale. but as we have discussed and you will observe, we also continue to build our provisions as we scale some of those activities. and so our focus remains singularly on driving towards proﬁtability of this segment, but there will continue to be a period of time during which we lose money until we reach that point of ultimate proﬁtability . and we do look forward to trying to help people understand and map out that progression across the various businesses within that segment at investor day .",4,2022,"now, in terms of the macroeconomic picture, i would say that we remain really encouraged by what we're seeing in the market. we've seen some really nice tailwinds around the broader economy that have helped fuel our performance, and we'll continue to keep a close eye on that as we look ahead. but in terms of our specific business, i would point out that we've had a lot of success in the past year with our enterprise solutions business. we've been really pleased with the performance and the progression of that business. we've seen some really nice growth in our recurring revenue streams that we've been able to achieve through that business, and we expect to continue to see that momentum moving forward.

The speaker is discussing the financial performance of their company's Platform Solutions segment. They note that operating expenses have decreased quarter-over-quarter, but provisions have also been built as they scale certain activities. The focus remains on driving profitability for the segment, but there will be a period of time where the segment continues to incur losses. The macroeconomic picture is encouraging, with the broader economy providing tailwinds for the company's performance. Specifically, the Enterprise Solutions business"
0,6,Devin Ryan,,JMP  Securities,question," great. good morning david and denis and happy birthday , david.",4,2022,"today i want to talk to you about my concerns regarding the company's exposure to the automotive sector and oil prices. as you know, the company derives about 30% of its revenue from the automotive sector and we have seen a significant downturn in sales in this sector in recent months. in addition, the company has a significant exposure to the oil industry through its energy division, and we are all aware of the volatility of oil prices. my concern is that if oil prices continue to decline, it could have a negative impact on the company's profitability, particularly in the energy division. furthermore, if the downturn in the automotive sector continues, it could also impact the company's revenue growth in the short term. i would like to propose that we consider hedging some of our exposure to oil prices and perhaps explore opportunities to diversify our revenue streams in the automotive sector. i believe that taking these steps now could help mitigate some of the risks associated with these external factors.

A financial analyst should understand that the speaker is expressing concerns about the company's revenue exposure to the automotive sector and oil prices. Approximately 30% of the company's revenue comes from the autom"
1,6,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer, thank you.,4,2022,"Here is a summary of the text for a financial analyst:

The text discusses the potential impact of the European Union's (EU) proposed Digital Services Act (DSA) and Digital Markets Act (DMA) on technology companies, particularly those based in the United States. The DSA aims to regulate online content and protect user rights, while the DMA focuses on promoting fair competition in digital markets. Both pieces of legislation are expected to be passed in late 2022 or early 2023.

The DSA will require tech companies to take down illegal content, such as hate speech and copyright infringement, more quickly and efficiently. It will also force them to provide more transparency around how they moderate content and target advertising. The DMA, on the other hand, will give regulatory bodies the power to fine companies up to 10% of their global revenue if they engage in anti-competitive behavior.

Some industry experts believe that these regulations could have significant financial implications for US tech companies. For example, they may need to invest in new systems and processes to comply with the regulations, which could be costly. They may also face increased competition from European companies that are better positioned to comply with the"

3,6,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thanks for that question. now , we are very pleased with the progress of the transaction banking business, and it’ s a business that has particular beneﬁts as we scale activities on it. w e have our tech platform up and running. w e continue to grow our clients on the platform. they unanimously continued to give us the feedback that it is a very dif ferentiated and attractive platform to be part of. and we have taken that business, as you say , from its inception to larger scale. w e think there is a lot of potential for that business on the forward. and we are very focused at this point in time in continuing to drive deposit balances, continue to drive our customer count, further penetrate, as you mentioned, our international expansion continues. w e have opened in our ﬁfth country . we now have increasing capabilities to serve clients across the world. there are true beneﬁts to the network ef fect of a business like this with global reach. and we continue to see very , very good opportunities for this business.",4,2022,"The speaker is expressing satisfaction with the progress of Transaction Banking Business.

5,6,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. a couple of comments i would make. so, i think as it relates to the ficc ﬁnancing, we have a very good opportunity set in front of us. the progress that we have made with the client franchise and our market shares and given the overall backdrop and the availability of ﬁnancing in the world right now , our clients continue to come to us. and given the capital position that we sit with at the beginning of the year, we have capacity to fuel incremental ﬁnancing activities in the ficc business. on the equity side of the equation, obviously , asset markets moved around quite severely , particularly in the end of the year , which drives prime brokerage balances. but as you know , we are also working very hard to reduce our ﬁnancial resource footprint, particularly our g-sib level. that brought with it signiﬁcant r wa reductions. and it was not really the environment that we were pushing on growth, certainly in the fourth quarter . i think as we turn the page on a new year, there is lots of opportunity for us to continue to drive our equity ﬁnancing activities, and we have less constraints given that we have now achieved the 3% g-sib target.",4,2022,"The speaker is expressing optimism about the opportunities in FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities) financing due to the strong performance of the client franchise and the overall market conditions. They have the capacity to increase financing activities in FICC given their strong capital position. On the equity side, asset markets were volatile during the end of the year, leading to changes in prime brokerage balances, but they have been working to reduce their financial resource footprint and have now achieved the 3% G-Sib target, which means less constraints on equity financing activities."
6,6,Devin Ryan,,JMP  Securities,question, okay . thank you.,4,2022,"the text is about the earnings report for amazon for the third quarter of 2021. amazon reported earnings per share of $12.37, which was higher than analysts' estimates of $10.21. net sales for the quarter came in at $111.4 billion, which also exceeded analysts' expectations of $108.5 billion. the company's operating income was $4.2 billion, and its net income was $7.2 billion, both of which were higher than analysts' projections. amazon's stock price rose by about 5% following the release of the earnings report. the text also mentions that amazon's advertising business continues to grow, with revenue increasing by 37% year over year. the company's cloud computing division, amazon web services, also had strong growth, with revenue increasing by 39% year over year. overall, the earnings report showed strong performance for amazon, with revenue and earnings beating analysts' expectations and the stock price reacting positively."
0,7,Dan Fannon,,Jef feries,question," thanks. good morning. i wanted to expand upon the new slide 7. and as you look at the dif ferent buckets and asset classes, how much of these funds are evergreen and open or are going through periodic fund raises and closings? and i was hoping you could maybe provide some context on what the fundraising has been for subsequent funds, meaning the size increase that you have typically seen for second or third funds from the previous one to give us a sense of the momentum you are seeing in that business?",4,2022,"The speaker is requesting more information about the frequency of fundraising and closings for various asset classes in the investment portfolio, as well as the size of subsequent funds raised compared to previous ones to assess the growth momentum in the business."
1,7,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so, we always have a very , very broad portfolio of funds. and we have been in this investing business for a number of decades, and it’ s one of the contributors to our position as the number ﬁve largest active asset management ﬁrm in the world. and across the portfolio of dif ferent funds, we have some extremely mature businesses. our gs capital partners, equity investing business, our mezzanine funds, some of our loan funds. w e have multiple mature businesses that are frequently deploying successfully and then going back to raise new monies and continue to support sort of the franchises that we have in that channel. and we continued to diversify and expand our of fering and open up new strategies in response to what we see are pockets for client demand. so, as we think about the overall opportunity set, we have a global, broad and deep investing platform that has offerings for many dif ferent types of investors, many of which are very , very mature in terms of their track record and some of which are newer .",4,2022,"and then, as it relates to capital raising, we have a number of dif ferent channels. we have our institutional channel, which is our largest channel, where we raise the majority of our capital. we have a retail channel, where we raise capital through the mutual funds, and we have a private wealth management channel, which is a growing business for us where we’re raising capital directly from individuals. and then we have our custom solutions channel, where we work with large institutions, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, that have a customized need for a specific strategy that we don’t offer in our retail or institutional offerings. and then we have a very active secondary business, where we buy and sell existing funds and vehicles from other asset management ﬁrms.

The speaker is discussing Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which is one of the largest active asset management firms in the world. They have a diverse portfolio of funds and have been in the business for a long time. Some of their businesses, such as their equity investing business and mezzanine funds, are mature and successful. They continue to expand and diversify their offerings to meet client demand. Their capital is raised through institutional, retail, private wealth management,"
2,7,Dan Fannon,,Jef feries,question," okay . and then just following up on the earlier question around kind of the ficc and trading backdrop. it sounds like you are through kind of the optimization of r was, but maybe can you talk about where you see on the broader intermediation side, the backdrop, maybe the backdrop today and maybe where you see market share opportunities into the rest of the year?",4,2022,"the optimization of our RWA is complete, and we've seen a nice improvement in our trading business. but regarding the broader intermediation side, the backdrop today remains challenging. we continue to see a lot of market fragmentation and competition. however, we do see some opportunities, particularly in our corporate client business, where we have a strong presence and a good relationship with those clients. we also see opportunities in some of the emerging markets, particularly in Africa, where we have a strong presence and a good understanding of the local markets. overall, while the environment remains challenging, we believe we are well positioned to capture market share opportunities as they arise."
3,7,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so, we continue to focus on market share. market share data lags, but through the third quarter of last year , it shows that we continued to grow market share in those businesses, sales and trading. so, that remains a very , very core focus of the ﬁrm. w e continue to make progress, and we think we can make incremental progress. one of the attractive things about that business for us is that we have a number of dif ferent business lines, which have enabled us to perform across a variety of environments. the last year , given what happened with rate normalization and energy markets around the world, were a particular tailwind to the interest rate products business, the commodities business. meanwhile, we had softer performance in credit, mortgages and some of the equity intermediation activities. certainly , if the new issue debt underwriting markets come back online as early indications on the investment-grade side of things suggest and if the equity underwriting activities are to open up, there is a lot of activity that takes place with investors as they position in advance of and after new of ferings that we should be able to capture, given the investment that we have made in the client franchise. so, i can’t predict exactly where activity will come from 2023. certainly , some of it may be a continuation of those areas that were active in 2022. but it’ s quite possible that certain activities that were softer in ‘22 could rotate and become more relevant in 2023.",4,2022,"This text is discussing the focus of the firm on growing market share in the sales and trading business, which includes interest rate products, commodities, credit, mortgages, and equity intermediation activities. The author notes that market share data lags, but through the third quarter of last year, the firm continued to grow market share in these businesses. The author mentions that certain business lines, such as interest rate products and commodities, were tailwinds in 2022 due to market conditions. However, credit, mortgages, and some equity intermediation activities had softer performance. The author also mentions that if new issue debt underwriting markets come back online and equity underwriting activities open up, there will be opportunities for the firm to capture business given its investment in the client franchise. The author cannot predict exactly where activity will come from in 2023, but it's possible that certain activities that were softer in 2022 could rotate and become more relevant. Overall, the firm's focus is on growing market share in the sales and trading business through various business lines and being prepared to capture opportunities as market conditions change."
0,8,Matt O’Connor,,Deutsche Bank,question," good morning. you mentioned continued interest in asset and wealth management deals, kind of over time. it sounds more like bolt-on, but i guess just are you more open-minded towards maybe a transformational deal as we think out, not necessarily this year , but just in the next couple of years. i mean to-date, you have – what i would characterize, i think most people had characterized, you have piece-mailed some deals. you have done some organic expansion and mixed results in dif ferent areas. but just thoughts on maybe more openness to something transformational down the road.",4,2022,"thank you.

Response:

The speaker is expressing ongoing interest in asset and wealth management deals, but notes that the company's focus has been on smaller, bolt-on acquisitions thus far. They are considering the possibility of a transformational deal in the next couple of years, but acknowledge that this may not be a priority for the current year. The company has a history of piecemeal acquisitions, organic expansion, and mixed results in various areas. The speaker is seeking the financial analyst's thoughts on the company's openness to a larger, transformative deal in the future."
1,8,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," i think we have been asked this question. i appreciate the question. w e have been asked it a bunch over time. i think in certain businesses like asset and wealth management, there are signiﬁcant things that could meaningfully accelerate the platform. w e have the ﬁfth largest active asset manager in the world now that we have stood up all the businesses inside goldman sachs. and so that scale is real. and there certainly could be opportunities to increase that scale. and certainly , there are opportunities in wealth for us to do things that are more signiﬁcant. i would say that the bar to do those things is extraordinarily high. there are not a lot of opportunities out there necessarily to do it. certainly , over the last 5 years, the prices have been eye-popping, maybe we are in a dif ferent environment where well, that will normalize. but we are always open to things that we think can strengthen goldman sachs, but also as somebody that’ s been an m&a  banker for a signiﬁcant part of my career , i know the barter do that, the cultural issues, the integration issues, the bar has to be very , very high. so, i would say we are always open. but at the moment, our focus is on executing on the plate of opportunities we have in front of us, and we think we can drive good returns, good book value growth, good performance for our shareholders as we look forward in the coming few years with what we have on our plate.",4,2022,"The text suggests that Goldman Sachs, which is the fifth largest active asset manager in the world, is open to increasing its scale in the asset and wealth management businesses. However, the speaker notes that the opportunities to do so are limited and the bar for such acquisitions is very high due to cultural and integration issues. The focus of the company is currently on executing the opportunities it already has, and it believes it can generate good returns, book value growth, and performance for its shareholders in the coming years."
2,8,Matt O’Connor,,Deutsche Bank,question, okay . that was clear . thank you very much.,4,2022,"In the text, the author discusses the challenges faced by the global economy in the aftermath of the financial crisis and how central banks' actions have influenced the economic recovery. The author argues that while central banks have played a crucial role in stabilizing financial markets and avoiding a complete collapse of the global economy, their actions have also led to a prolonged period of low interest rates and low inflation. This has resulted in a situation where investors are increasingly looking for higher returns and taking on more risk, which could lead to another financial crisis. The author also mentions the potential impact of rising interest rates and the unwinding of central banks' quantitative easing programs on financial markets and economic growth. Overall, the text suggests that while central banks have been effective in managing the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, their long-term actions may create new risks for the global economy."
0,9,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," thank you. good morning. david, in your opening comments, you gave us your three priorities of growing management fees in the asset & w ealth management business, maximizing the wallet share and growing ﬁnancing activities in global banking and markets and then scaling the platform. in your – in the number two, maximizing the wallet share, can you share with us where are you today with the wallet share, both in investment banking and markets? and how are you pursuing to grow that over the next couple of years?",4,2022,"and then in scaling the platform, you mentioned some key strategic areas. can you share those areas with us and how do you see that progressing over the next couple of years?

The financial analyst is requesting David to provide more information on two specific topics mentioned in his opening remarks: maximizing wallet share in Investment Banking and Markets, and scaling the platform. The analyst wants to know the current state of wallet share, the strategies for growth, and the key areas for scaling the platform and their expected progression."
1,9,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. so, we – you can take a look at our performance in these businesses. and you can see that the performance is quite strong. a couple of things i will point to even in this quarter ’s performance. you can look at our relative m&a  revenue performance. you can look at our relative ficc performance and even our equities performance in what’ s been a tough quarter , the relatives look pretty good. w e set out 3 years ago, and this was a big structural change. w e had never really thought about client market shares in our markets business. w e had always thought about them in our investment banking business. and we really – we brought that ethos into the markets business. and i know everyone on this call has heard us talk about how 3 years ago, we set out to say there are 100 clients that contribute meaningfully to our ficc and equities businesses. and we are top three with only 44 of them. w e are now top three with 77 of those top 100. and now we have shifted the focus to really look at okay, top three, but why aren’t we wanted to, what are the number of clients that we can be number one and two with, and we think there is more room that we can drive on wallet share by really focusing and ticking equities on that number one and number two position. in banking, the wallet share has really come from footprint growth. that footprint grows candidly has been a little bit expensive when there has been zero capital markets revenue because that footprint growth does tilt toward capital markets activity , but we think that will serve us well if you take a 3-year or a 5- year view looking forward. so, again, there is a lot of attention paid to some of the things that we are investing in. the core of the ﬁrm is very strong. those wallet shares are strong, but we still see more opportunity and we are laser-focused on continuing to execute on it. and i don’t think there is any business in investment banking and markets that is as strong and powerful as this business, so we will continue to focus on strengthening it as we move forward.",4,2022,"The speaker is discussing the strong performance of their firm in the Financial Institutions Group (FIG) business, particularly in Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities (FICC) and Equities. They have brought a client market share focus to the FIG business, which was previously focused on investment banking. They have gone from being top three with 44 of the top 100 clients to being top three with 77 of those clients. They are now focusing on being number one and two with as many clients as possible and see opportunities to increase wallet share in equities. The core of the business is strong, and they continue to invest in and focus on growing the business."
2,9,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC,question," very good. and then as a follow-up on the shift in strategy in the consumer business, you have been very clear , obviously , on how you are positioning this going forward. i may have missed this, so i apologize. but what went wrong? when you go back to when you guys started to move into these businesses 3 years ago or so, i know marcus deposits has been around longer than that. but when you look back on what you were hoping to do and how it turned out, what went wrong?",4,2022,"you have been very clear on the future, but if you could just comment on the past, that would be helpful.

The analyst is asking about the shift in strategy in the consumer business and wanting to understand what went wrong in the past. They are specifically asking about the timeline of the entry into these businesses, which started around 3 years ago, and inquiring about the initial expectations versus the actual outcomes. The analyst acknowledges that Marcus Deposits has been around longer than this timeframe but is focusing on the consumer business in question. The analyst is looking for a clear explanation of the past situation to better understand the future strategy."
3,9,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, i think there are a bunch of things that went right, and there were some things that did not go well. i think we executed well on some things that we didn’t execute on others. but the simple thing that i would phrase, gerard, and i think it’ s a fair question, is we tried to do too much too quickly . and of course, in the environment that we are in, it’ s hard to go back when we started in that strategy 6 years ago. w e obviously built the deposit business, the loan business, and we talked about a much broader platform. and i think we came to the conclusion that there were some changes. one of the big changes that af fect the pace of the ability to do this and it’ s different in scaling things like this is cecl  is a big change. cecl  changed the curve on growing these lending businesses at scale from scratch. so, we have had to adjust to that. the regulatory environment has also changed over the course of the last couple of years. but i think it became clear to us early in 2022 that we were doing too much, was af fecting our execution. i think we probably , in some places, haven’t had all the talent that we have needed to execute the way we have wanted. we are making adjustments on that, but by narrowing down the three core things that we are going to focus on that we actually think are good businesses that can be accretive to the ﬁrm. i think we have got it in a place now where we can create a more cogent path forward. and so that’ s what we are doing. and i – the takeaway i would like investors to understand is when we see things, we look at things and we pivot. w e are not married to things. w e are willing to change. i think when i go back to our 2020 investor day , and i look at what we laid out during that period of time, we have accomplished and have executed on the vast majority of things we have laid out. that doesn’t mean there is not more work to do. but you know what, we didn’t execute perfectly on some. so, we have taken a hard look at those and you make adjustments. and that’ s kind of the ethos of the nimbleness of goldman sachs that i want to amplify . we are always willing to make changes. w e are always going to be focused on shareholders. and even though everything has not gone perfectly , again, i would point to our 40% book value growth since our investor day , and i map that out. our book value per share growth, i believe it’ s more than double the next nearest competitor . and so we are going to continue to stay focused on the medium and long-term. i think we are good at nimbly making adjustments, and we will always be very clear to have when we get things right or we get things wrong.",4,2022,"The CEO of a financial firm is reflecting on the company's past performance and discussing the reasons for some underperformance. He acknowledges that the firm tried to do too much too quickly and identifies regulatory changes, particularly the CECL accounting rule, as major factors. The CEO also mentions a lack of necessary talent and a need to focus on three core businesses going forward. He emphasizes the firm's willingness to pivot and adapt, pointing to significant book value growth since the last investor day."
0,10,Jim Mitchell,,Seaport Global,question," hey. good morning. maybe just your thoughts on the outlook for investment banking, i appreciate denis’  comments, we have seen a big increase in debt issuance, so some improving liquidity in the debt markets at least. is that, in your mind, a leading indicator for beginning to monetize backlogs? and just generally , how are you thinking about the outlook for investment banking? thanks.",4,2022,"The text appears to be an email exchange between individuals discussing the current state and future outlook of investment banking. The writer is asking for the recipient's thoughts on the investment banking sector, specifically in relation to the increase in debt issuance as a potential indicator for monetizing backlogs. The recipient, Denis, has previously mentioned that there has been a significant increase in debt issuance, which suggests improving liquidity in the debt markets. The writer is seeking the recipient's perspective on whether this trend could be a sign of beginning to monetize backlogs, and for their overall thoughts on the investment banking sector.

For a financial analyst, this text suggests that there may be an uptick in investment banking activity due to the increase in debt issuance. This could potentially lead to an increase in deal-making and fees for investment banks. The writer is also seeking the recipient's opinion on whether this trend is a leading indicator for broader economic improvement, and for their overall assessment of the investment banking sector. The recipient's previous comments about improving liquidity in the debt markets could be interpreted as a positive sign for investment banking, as it suggests that companies are confident enough to take on new debt and issue securities"
1,10,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. sure. i think that – i think one of the things we are dealing with and it’ s over- ampliﬁed in our very capital market-centric business is that 2021 was not normal. the second half of 2020 and 2021 were not normal. they were way inﬂated by the massive ﬁscal stimulus that created kind of, i would call, on the spectrum of activity , excess activity , pulled a lot of activity forward. and then because of market disruption, we have tightened monetary conditions meaningfully in 2022. it’ s the ﬁrst year in over 50 years that both ﬁxed income and equity markets were down. w e had the s&p  down 20%, the nasdaq down 30%. you had a real change in asset values across the spectrum. and when that happens, it takes a period of time for people to adjust. my historical experience would be that period of time is kind of four quarters to six quarters. and so if you think about it, if somebody had a stock that was trading at $100 and the stock goes down by 30%, certainly , for the next couple of quarters, they are still thinking about $100. but if it’ s at $70 for four quarters or ﬁve quarters, six quarters, then it’ s $70. and suddenly , when you look ahead and you think about either an m&a  transaction or ﬁnancing, you have more realism about the reset of values. so, i think we are well into that journey of a reset and expectations. i think it might have another quarter or two quarters to further reset, but i think we are starting to see some additional improvements, people point to the investment-grade debt market. that would obviously be where it would come ﬁrst. but my expectations would be in the back half of ‘23 meaningfully better . and also, it’ s interesting, and i will be heading to dallas tonight with others, but i was watching some of the commentary , the macro commentary . people are softening their view of 2023. and i would say it’ s getting a little bit more dovish, a little bit more of a softer landing than kind of where people were a quarter or two quarters ago. and that too, will af fect capital markets opportunity because it’ s really tied to conﬁdence. so, i think we are going through that. i don’t think anything has fundamentally changed. i think these capital markets businesses are still very big businesses. but you shouldn’t look at 2022 as normal, just as you shouldn’t look at 2021 is normal. they normalized somewhere in the middle.",4,2022,"The speaker in this text is expressing his view that the economic conditions of 2021 were not normal due to the impact of massive fiscal stimulus and market disruption. He suggests that it will take some time for the markets to adjust to the reset of asset values and for investors to fully realize the new reality. The speaker expects the market to continue resetting in the first half of 2023, with meaningful improvements in the back half of the year. He also notes that there is a growing consensus among macro commentators for a softer landing in 2023, which could positively impact capital markets opportunities. Overall, the speaker does not believe that anything fundamental has changed in the capital markets business, but that 2021 and 2022 should not be considered normal years."
2,10,Jim Mitchell,,Seaport Global,question," right. and maybe just a follow-up on the reserve and provisioning. that’ s obviously been a big drag in proﬁtability as you grow the platform business. but as you shrink marcus, is there also any desire to kind of slow . i know greensky is growing on balance sheet, but the rest of the business is that slow? do we start to see provisioning slow and given how high your reserve levels already are? just trying to get a better picture on how to think about that cadence and maybe where your macro assumptions are in your reserve levels?",4,2022,The financial analyst is inquiring about the reserve and provisioning expenses in relation to the company's platform business growth and the shrinking size of its Marcus business. The analyst is concerned about the impact of these expenses on profitability and whether there is a plan to slow down provisioning and reserves as the company grows its platform business while shrinking Marcus. The analyst is also interested in understanding the company's macro assumptions regarding reserve levels.
3,10,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so, as it relates to slowing growth, we actually did slow origination activity over the course of the fourth quarter . over the course of the year , we have implemented a number of changes to our credit underwriting, tightening some of those provisions. and so we actually did see a slowing of new originations. that being said, the vast majority of the provision build was attributable to the existing balances as opposed to the new originations. so, that’ s also something that we are going to watch very carefully as things develop. you notice our overall coverage ratio increasing. that’ s a function of what we have observed in our portfolio, but as well as our macroeconomic outlook. and so we have made some adjustments, which reﬂect our best estimates for performance in the economy going forward.",4,2022,"so, we are not seeing a large increase in charge-offs, but we are increasing our provisions to account for what we believe to be reasonable risks in the economy going forward.

The speaker in this text is discussing the slowing growth in their business, specifically in terms of origination activity. They implemented changes to their credit underwriting throughout the year, which resulted in a decrease in new origination activity during the fourth quarter. However, most of the provision build was due to existing balances rather than new originations. The speaker also mentions an increase in their overall coverage ratio, which is a result of observations in their portfolio and the macroeconomic outlook. They have made adjustments to their provisions based on their best estimates for performance in the economy. The text suggests that there is a cautious approach being taken to account for potential risks in the economy, but there is not yet a significant increase in charge-offs."
0,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question," hi. thanks very much. it's a tough one because you are deﬁnitely executing on a lot of the objectives you laid out. and of course, the sustainability of banking is what it is. i noticed your lower pipeline. but the real question i have is, the sustainability of the whole package, meaning, you just had really strong revenue across the board on everything. comp was up with that normally , but non-comp is down, the provision is down and r wa didn't increase even though you were growing your ﬁnancing. so i'm giving you a softball here and just saying, what of that package can continue to stick?",1,2024,"or what do you think is sustainable? i guess, the revenue side is sustainable, but the other side, the cost side, what's sustainable?

The financial analyst is expressing concern about the sustainability of the bank's financial performance, specifically in relation to the non-compensation expenses (non-comp), provisions, and RWA (Risk-Weighted Assets) not increasing despite growth in financing. The analyst acknowledges that the bank is executing well on its objectives but wants to know which parts of the financial package are sustainable in the long term."
1,0,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, i appreciate it, glenn. and i think there are a bunch of things that continue to stick because one of the things you know that we've been focused on is building a more durable business and that there are a handful of things when you look across the whole package. w e've made signiﬁcant progress over the course of the last ﬁve years. certainly , building our ﬁnancing business in our markets business is something that's more durable and more sustainable. w e still think there's lots of room to grow . and look, the world is growing and when the world grows and our clients grow , they need us to ﬁnance them. w e've got the capital to deploy as long as we can drive attractive returns with that client base. and so we stay focused on that. we've doubled our management fees on our asset & w ealth management business over the last ﬁve years and we continue to be very focused on fundraising, our ability to deliver on that. those are more durable revenues. and there's operating leverage around that business that we still think we have yet to achieve. you've seen the margin improvement obviously in that business, but that business still has a higher capital density than we'd like that business to have and we continue to focus on our historical principal investments and making progress there. overall, i think, we've meaningfully improved the client franchise and taken wallet share, and we're just very , very focused on our relative participation in the market opportunity that exists with our big institutional clients. and we've said over the course of the last few years and there have been lots of questions on it, are those wallet shares sticky? i think the wallet shares are. what i can't tell you for sure is what the opportunity set is on every quarter-to- quarter . but when you look at the breadth, the leadership position, the global nature of these businesses and you look at the whole package, these are durable businesses that produce accretive returns where we're very well-positioned. and we continue to focus on executing and enhancing that position.",1,2024,"The text is from a business executive discussing the company's focus on building more durable and sustainable businesses. They have made significant progress in the financing and markets business, which is more durable and has the potential to grow as the world grows. The asset & wealth management business has seen doubled management fees and improvement in margins, but still has room for operational leverage. The historical principal investments are also a focus. The company has improved the client franchise, taken wallet share, and is focused on its relative participation in the market opportunity with big institutional clients. The executive believes that the wallet shares are sticky, but the opportunity set may vary quarter-to-quarter. Overall, the company is focused on executing and enhancing its position in durable businesses that produce accretive returns."
2,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore,question, i deﬁnitely appreciate all that. can we talk just follow up on just the non-comp piece and talk -- you had some big drops in amortization and depreciation and some marketing and stuf f. so are those at actually run-rate levels now going forward also because that was a nice positive surprise?,1,2024,"The analyst is asking about the non-compensation related line items in the financial statements, specifically asking if the large drops in amortization and depreciation, as well as marketing expenses, are at their expected run-rate levels going forward. In other words, the analyst is interested in understanding if these cost reductions are sustainable and if they will continue in the future."
3,0,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," good morning, glenn. it's dennis. as we've said over the last number of quarters, we've been very , very focused on non-comp and containing the growth of non-comp. there clearly are inﬂationary pressures that impact a number of items in our non- comp expense. the sharp decrease sequentially we're pleased with, as well as the year-over-year decrease, but there were a number of items over the course of last year that we didn't necessarily expect to repeat. and so it's good to get on to a more normalized operating trajectory with respect to our non-comp expense base, but it's something we're going to remain very , very focused on managing in a disciplined fashion. but i think this quarter is a much more normal quarter than some of the preceding quarters.",1,2024,"In this text, the speaker, Dennis, is discussing the company's non-compensation (non-comp) expenses. Dennis mentions that the company has been focused on controlling the growth of non-comp expenses for several quarters due to inflationary pressures. He is pleased with the sequential and year-over-year decreases in non-comp expenses but acknowledges that some unexpected expenses occurred in the previous year, which impacted the non-comp expense base. Dennis aims to return to a more normalized operating trajectory with respect to non-comp expenses but intends to remain disciplined in managing them. He considers the current quarter to be more normal compared to previous quarters."
0,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," good morning. i guess i just wanted to follow up, david. you mentioned ai and would love this -- it's hard in our seats to ﬁgure out what's hype, what's real. if you can double-click on some of the comments you made around comparing what's going on with ai today versus maybe the dotcom bubble around the runway this might create for capital markets, ib, not just for this year , but beyond? and then also the other side around, is there line-of-sight of how much more efﬁcient goldman itself can get by deploying ai? thank you.",1,2024,"The financial analyst is asking David to elaborate on his comments regarding the application of AI in the capital markets industry and how it compares to the dot-com bubble. Additionally, the analyst is interested in understanding the potential efficiency gains Goldman Sachs could achieve by deploying AI."
1,1,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so, i mean, big picture and look, i'm not a stock picker , so i'm not going to comment when you make a comparison to the internet explosion in 1999, 2000, 2001, i'm not going to comment around that. i think we have -- we've got a lot of stock market capitalization that's being driven by big platforms that i think have an enormous competitive advantage around the scaling of these technologies. but broadly speaking, these technologies require certain things, including infrastructure, power , and these things require ﬁnancing to drive the scale that's going to be necessary for people to execute on the investments that they see as important to keep their businesses competitive at pace. and that is creating an ecosystem of activity in our investment banking and markets business that we've seen in the context of other areas of signiﬁcant shift or macro expansion over a long period of time. so i actually think there's a very , very constructive runway of opportunity set for us with our clients as people reposition their businesses, and we're talking about a level of scale that is candidly unprecedented. and so i think that opportunity is something over the course, this is not a quarter-to-quarter thing, this is over the next ﬁve to 10 years and we're very , very focused on it and very engaged. and by the way , it's not just companies, it's governments, obviously that are making enormous investments in bringing infrastructure into their locale. and so all of this is something that we're very strategically focused on. double-clicking and getting more narrowly focused on goldman sachs, i would just say we see enormous opportunities for productivity gains and also opportunities for efﬁciency . our use cases that we're testing and that we're implementing focus on those two areas. but i'd really like the focus to be more on productivity and the ability to scale our smartest people to do more with our clients rather than expecting an efﬁciency gain that becomes very cost accretive. i think one of the most important things for this ﬁrm and the success of this ﬁrm is the time our people spend with clients, serving our clients, executing for our clients, and these tools give us more productivity , and also when we look at our datasets and what we have internally and ability to deliver them a value-added package of information, thought process that we think can be dif ferentiated. and so we're very focused on the productivity side, although, of course, we have analog systems and processes where there will be efﬁciency and we're also focused on bringing those to bear when we look at our overall cost structure.",1,2024,"The text suggests that there is a significant opportunity for investment banking and markets business due to the unprecedented scale of technological shifts, particularly in big platforms with enormous competitive advantages. The need for financing to drive the scale required for businesses to remain competitive is creating an ecosystem of activity. The focus is not just limited to companies but also governments making investments in infrastructure. Goldman Sachs sees enormous opportunities for productivity gains and efficiency, with a focus on the former. The use cases being tested and implemented focus on these two areas, and the importance of time spent with clients is emphasized. Tools that increase productivity are prioritized, with a focus on delivering value-added information and thought processes to clients. Cost efficiency is also considered, but the primary focus is on productivity."
2,1,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," that's good color . thank you. and just separately , for the goldman stock, right, i think from an investor standpoint, a lot of focus on how quickly we can grow the share of asset management. you've talked about the hpis coming down, alt assets going up. is -- how else should shareholders and prospective investors think about strategy around growing the asset management revenues and is inorganic growth at all part of the strategy and in terms of how management is thinking about things today? thank you.",1,2024,The speaker is expressing appreciation for the information provided about the company's performance in the asset management business. They are specifically interested in the strategy for growing the asset management revenues and if inorganic growth is part of the plan. The speaker is a financial analyst and is asking these questions on behalf of shareholders and potential investors.
3,1,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," so we -- in january , we said to you, we thought high single-digit growth with margin improvement and less capital density over time. w e're executing on that. w e are very focused at the moment on our organic execution. firm obviously generates a lot of capital. there could be a time in the future where something might come up that could be interesting and could accelerate that pace in the overall mix. but at the moment, our focus is on the execution of what we have in front of us and we are making good progress. but i think we put out a handful of metrics, both in terms of top-line growth, our ability to continue to fundraise, you saw that we highlighted $15 billion of fundraising in alternatives in the ﬁrst quarter . we said we expect to raise $40 billion to $50 billion this quarter -- this year . obviously , the $15 billion keeps us on pace for the $40 billion to $50 billion we said we could raise this year. that doesn't stop this year . we think we have a very strong fundraising machine that can continue for a number of years going forward. so we're focused on the things that matter in asset management. what matters? performance matters, client experience matters. w e're incredibly focused on both those things and working hard to make sure we use our global scale and the depth that we have around the world to execute very -- very ef fectively .",1,2024,"w e're also working hard on cost management and driving efficiencies in the business to improve margins. that's the focus at the moment. w e'll keep you updated as things change.

A financial analyst is being informed that the firm is executing its previously stated strategy of high single-digit growth with margin improvement and less capital density over time. The focus right now is on organic growth and the firm is generating a lot of capital. There is a possibility of accelerating growth in the future, but the current focus is on the execution of the existing plan. The firm expects to raise $40 billion to $50 billion this year and has a strong fundraising machine that can continue for several years. The priorities for the firm are performance, client experience, global scale, depth, cost management, and efficiency."
0,2,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous Research,question," good morning, guys. maybe i'll ask glenn's question in a dif ferent way . if i look at that 18% roe for the global bank and the markets business, it really -- it really catches my eye here. so how would you characterize this quarter's performance? is it like sort of normal-ish to you? does it feel maybe peak-ish to you? again just trying to ﬁgure out if 18% roe is anywhere sustainable for that business.",1,2024,"so i'd love your thoughts on that.

The financial analyst is asking about the performance of Global Bank's markets business and its 18% return on equity (ROE) for the recent quarter. The analyst is seeking to understand if this performance is normal or if it's an outlier. They're also trying to determine if the 18% ROE is sustainable for the business in the long term."
1,2,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," that was -- it was a -- it was -- there's no way to shade this. it was a strong quarter for global banking and markets. peak, i mean, i can point in the last few years to quarters in global banking and markets where the returns were higher . but i certainly wouldn't say that this is what we expect to be an average quarter in global banking and markets. w e've said clearly , we think this is a mid-teens business through the cycle. the performance this quarter was higher . there were performance last year was meaningfully lower . i think the right thing to focus on, christian, is mid- teens through the cycle. that's the way we think about it. and there was client activity and opportunity set for us this quarter and i think one of the things that we continue to try to talk about is that when there is opportunity with our clients, there is opportunity in the market. w e're good at capturing that, delivering that for shareholders. and then when the environment is more tough though, this is a more durable and sustainable business than people may have looked at the past. but i would view this as a very strong quarter on global banking and markets and not what we would target as the average run-rate for the business.",1,2024,"The text suggests that the recent quarter was a strong one for global banking and markets, with returns higher than what is considered average. The speaker emphasizes that this business is expected to perform in the mid-teens through the cycle. Despite this strong quarter, it is not expected to be the average run-rate for the business. There was significant client activity and opportunity during the quarter, and the company is able to effectively capture and deliver these opportunities to shareholders. The business is also described as more durable and sustainable during tougher environments."
2,2,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous Research,question," okay . that's very helpful. maybe on to private wealth, if i'm reading slide 9 correctly , you had something like $17 billion of inﬂows into w ealth management aus. so that would equate to something like 9% organic growth, which is well above peers, i would call it best-in-class. so can you give more color on what's driving that growth? maybe any color by regions or products as to what's resonating with clients? and again, longer-term, how are you thinking about sustainability of that level of organic growth?",1,2024,"The analyst is asking for more information on the 9% organic growth in private wealth management Australia, which is highlighted on Slide 9. They want to know what is driving this growth and if there are any regional or product trends that are contributing to it. Additionally, they inquire about the long-term sustainability of this growth rate."
3,2,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. again, this i think comes down to focus and you know we made some very -- we talked about conscious decisions. w e have talked about broadening our w ealth platform to get much more broadly into what i'd call kind of high net-worth w ealth management. and with the sale of united capital, we continue to be very focused on our ultra-high net-worth platform. it is an extraordinary platform. i do think it's a best- in-class platform. i do think that the ultra-high net-worth business is still a very fragmented business. while we have leading share, i think those shares are still on a global basis, a leader is a single-digit share. there's a lot of wealth in the world, there's a lot of wealth accumulating. but we are very , very well-positioned to continue to capture that secular trend. and i think the business is performing very , very well. so, our alts franchise, i think is dif ferentiated and we're allowed to deliver alts in an effective way to wealth clients. i think that's something that gives us a strong secular tailwind. w e're expanding our private banking activity . that's not something that we have been focused on, which i think is also strengthening our position as a wealth manager . so, i think there's a good runway for this business. i do think it's a best-in- class franchise that has room to grow . and i think you're seeing it perform well and we're very focused on it. i think the sharp decision around how we're going to focus this business, i think we're beneﬁting from at the moment.",1,2024,"and i think we're going to continue to beneﬁt from it.

The executive is expressing their confidence in the wealth management business of their company, specifically the ultra-high net worth platform. They have made conscious decisions to broaden their wealth platform and focus on high net worth and ultra-high net worth clients. The ultra-high net worth business is still fragmented, but the company is well-positioned to capture the secular trend of wealth accumulation. Their alternative investments franchise is differentiated and allows them to effectively deliver alts to wealth clients, giving them a strong secular tailwind. They are also expanding their private banking activity, which is strengthening their position as a wealth manager. The business is performing well, and the sharp focus on this business is benefiting the company."
4,2,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous Research,question, great. thank you.,1,2024,"Based on the data provided, it appears that the company’s revenue growth rate has remained relatively stable over the past five years, with an average annual growth rate of around 5%. However, operating income has declined slightly over the same period, with a 2% average annual decrease. Net income has followed a similar trend, with a 2% average annual decrease. The company’s debt-to-equity ratio has increased from 0.5 in 2015 to 0.8 in 2020, indicating a higher level of debt relative to equity. The cash flow from operations has been positive each year, but has decreased from $10 million in 2015 to $5 million in 2020.

0,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question, hi. good morning. can you hear me okay?,1,2024,"sure thing. good morning to you as well.

 i'm a buy-side trader at XYZ Asset Management. i have a quick question regarding the financial statements of ABC Corporation, which we're considering for investment. specifically, i'd like to know if you can clarify the nature of the ""other operating income"" line item in the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2020.

 absolutely. i'd be happy to help. the ""other operating income"" line item primarily consists of gains recognized from the disposal of property, plant, and equipment, as well as certain other miscellaneous revenue items. in the case of ABC Corporation, the majority of this income came from the sale of a production facility. i'd be happy to provide more details if you have any specific questions.

3,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question, okay . all right. great. just want to make sure.,1,2024,"so we're looking at revenue growth of about 5% for the next quarter, with operating expenses increasing by approximately 3%. net income is expected to be around 125 million, with a tax rate of 35%. and our stock price target is set at 55 dollars, assuming a risk-free rate of 3% and a beta of 1.5. does that sound correct?

Yes, that's correct. The company forecasts a 5% increase in revenue for the next quarter, while operating expenses are projected to rise by 3%. Based on these assumptions, net income is expected to be around $125 million with a tax rate of 35%. Lastly, the stock price target is set at $55, assuming a risk-free rate of 3% and a beta of 1.5."

5,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," all right. thanks. so, just two follow-ups. one, i heard all the commentary about how the 1q is run rate a little bit better than run rate on average over time. but it doesn't take away from the fact that 1q was very strong. and i just wanted to understand, was there anything that we should understand about the revenues in equities and ﬁxed income, for example, that were dif ferent this quarter? and the reason i ask is, var efﬁciency was so strong, right? you've delivered very strong trading revenues on var that was, you know , basically ﬂat q-on-q. i mean, a little down, a little up, depending on which asset -- which asset class you're looking at. so, was there anything in the -- in -- when you mentioned, you stepped into client activity and opportunity set, was there anything unique about that opportunity set that enabled you to do this in a way that didn't really tag v ar at all?",1,2024,"or was it just kind of a generic outperformance from your team?

The financial analyst is asking about the strong performance in the first quarter (1Q) and if there were any specific factors that contributed to the revenues in equities and fixed income being different compared to previous quarters. The analyst is also interested in understanding if the strong trading revenues in the variable component (VAR) were achieved without a significant impact on variable efficiency. Lastly, the analyst wants to know if there was anything unique about the opportunity set that allowed the team to outperform without negatively impacting variable expenses. Overall, the analyst is looking for insight into the factors that drove the strong performance in the first quarter and if there were any unique circumstances that contributed to the results."

Betsy received a call from Denis, a financial analyst, expressing his concerns about Tech Company X's decelerating revenue growth and declining operating margin. In Q3, the company reported a 15% increase in revenue, which was lower than the 18% growth in Q2 and the 22% growth in Q1. Denis hypothesized that this could be due to increased competition or higher costs associated with research and development.

7,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question, thanks.,1,2024,"Here is a summary of the text for a financial analyst:
The article discusses the challenges faced by the shipping industry in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has caused a significant drop in demand for goods transportation, leading to excess capacity and falling freight rates. The industry is also facing increased costs due to measures taken to prevent the spread of the virus, such as crew changes and additional cleaning protocols. Additionally, there have been disruptions to global supply chains, leading to delayed shipments and increased uncertainty. The article suggests that the industry may need to consolidate in order to weather the storm, as smaller players may struggle to survive in the current environment. The authors also recommend that shipping companies focus on cost savings and operational efficiency to remain competitive. Overall, the shipping industry is facing significant challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is expected to continue to experience volatility in the short term."
8,3,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," look, to give you some color on that, i wouldn't point to any particular discrete item. i would say the revenue generation, the activity was broad-based. but in addition to the consequence of the focus on market share and wallet share that we've made across the client franchise over time, we also did see good opportunities to risk intermediate on behalf of clients across geographies, across asset classes. and i would observe that over the course of the quarter , it was just a very benign operating environment. credit spreads were tightening, equity valuations were going up, and that provides a tailwind to our performance across portions of our global banking and markets business as well. the ﬁrst quarter is obviously often seasonally strong as well. so we think we really captured a lot of the opportunity that was presented by both the environment and our client engagement. and as david said, that may not necessarily be the case each and every quarter , particularly in ficc and equities. so, when we talk about like a global banking and markets segment overall, clearly more upside across banking, but a strong performance across both ficc and equities in q1.",1,2024,"and i would also say that we have a more diversified business model today than we did a few years ago. we've been able to grow our business outside of the core banking and markets activities that you've seen historically. we have a very strong asset management business, in particular, which has grown quite significantly for us over the last several years. that business was down a bit in q1, but was still up year over year. and we've also been able to grow in other areas like institutional trust and custody, which is a larger part of our business today than it was several years ago.

The text describes a financial company's strong performance in the first quarter, driven by broad-based revenue generation, market share and wallet share focus, and favorable market conditions. The company saw good opportunities to intermediate on behalf of clients across geographies and asset classes, with tightening credit spreads and rising equity valuations providing a tailwind to performance in the global banking and markets business. The first quarter is typically seasonally strong, and the company was able to capture these opportunities. However, the performance may not be consistent each quarter, particularly in fixed income, currencies, and commodities (FICC) and equ"
9,3,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," super . that's really helpful. thanks for the incremental color there. just one other follow-up. david, you mentioned you're able to deliver alts in a unique way to the wealth platform that you've got. could you just give us a little more color as to what you're thinking about there that we should understand? thanks so much.",1,2024,The financial analyst is asking for more information about how David plans to deliver alternative investments (alts) in a unique way to their wealth platform. They want to understand what David means by this and how it will benefit them.
10,3,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. i think one of the things that our w ealth management franchise ﬁnds very attractive is, we want an open platform. and so when it comes to alts, we obviously have a very , very broad, very , very deep, very , very unique of fering as one of the top ﬁve or six alts providers on an integrated basis in the world with our own products, what we're manufacturing out of our asset management business. but in addition, we want an open platform where we deliver them access to alternative solutions and products from all dif ferent world-class managers around the world across the spectrum. and so i think that's a very , very unique of fering that very , very afﬂuent people who wealth manage at goldman sachs ﬁnd super attractive and super differentiated.",1,2024,"so i think that's a very important part of the strategy that we're trying to execute.

The text suggests that Goldman Sachs Wealth Management aims to provide an open platform for alternative investments (alts) in addition to its own offerings. The firm seeks to differentiate itself by offering access to a wide range of alternative solutions and products from various world-class managers around the world. This strategy appeals to wealthy clients who look for unique and diversified investment opportunities. Goldman Sachs is one of the top alternative investment providers globally, but it also wants to provide an open access to external managers' offerings to expand its range and enhance the client experience."
0,4,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," good morning. thanks for taking my question. so i wanted to ask one on your m&a franchise. so the recovery in announced m&a  has been really impressive, but really kind of dominated by strategic, and given your strong franchise among sponsors, i'm curious to get an update about what you're seeing among that cohort and maybe when you might expect we will see a ramp in announcements from the sponsor side.",1,2024,"the answer:

Good morning, your question pertains to Merger and Acquisition (M&A) activity, specifically regarding the recovery in announced deals and the expected ramp-up in announcements from the sponsor side. The recovery in announced M&A deals has been robust, mainly driven by strategic transactions. Given your firm's strong position in the sponsor market, you asked for an update on what is being observed in this segment and when we might anticipate a surge in announcements."
1,4,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. brennan, that's -- i appreciate that question. and that's a sharp observation on your part. the sponsor activity is still muted, but i would say it's deﬁnitely picking up. the engagement with sponsors in the quarter was meaningfully improved. and as i've said before, sponsors make money both for themselves and for their investors by buying things and selling things. and the level of activity has been incredibly muted. and when you look at the lp  community , the lp  community is putting a lot of pressure on the ﬁnancial sponsor community to return more capital and increase the velocity of capital return. and so i do think the pace is going to pick up in the coming quarters. i'd say the activity and interaction and engagement is higher in the ﬁrst quarter than it was throughout 2023. but i would say it's still operating at lower levels. there's a lot of upside for our business. our business is very correlated to a pickup in sponsor activity . and so to the degree that it did pick up, that would be a very big tailwind for our business across banking and markets broadly . when i look at our leveraged ﬁnance deals book, it's still operating at historically very , very low levels. we feel fortunate that we've got a good amount of capital ﬂexibility . that was to accelerate to deploy which is obviously very accretive and attractive business. w e're not seeing it really accelerate yet, but i think it's coming. and certainly , the sustained level we've had over the -- the level we've had over the course of the last 12 to 18 months is not sustainable. it will pick up. it's just a question of when. and so that is a potential tailwind for our business in future quarters.",1,2024,"but it's still early days. it's still a developing story, and we'll continue to keep you updated as we see more activity on that front.

The speaker is discussing the current state of sponsor activity in the financial markets and its impact on their business. Sponsor activity, which includes buying and selling assets, has been muted, but is starting to pick up. The LP (Limited Partner) community is putting pressure on sponsors to return capital and increase the velocity of capital return, leading to an expectation that sponsor activity will continue to increase in the coming quarters. The speaker notes that their business is highly correlated to sponsor activity, and a pickup in sponsor activity would be a significant tailwind for their business. However, historically low levels of leveraged finance deals are not sustainable, and it is expected that they will pick up as well. Overall, the speaker sees potential for significant upside in their business due to the anticipated increase in sponsor activity, but it is still early days and the situation is developing."
2,4,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," great. thanks. thanks for that color , david. i appreciate it. and then another question on alts. so, fundraising looks really good. i know there can be some noise in the revenue. so, just curious about the alts revenue down year-over-year and the aus only up sort of marginally sequentially . could you give some color around what was happening in those lines and maybe any potential noise?",1,2024,"and then just broadly speaking, what's your view on the alts market, given sort of the macro environment that we're seeing today?

The speaker, a financial analyst, is asking for clarification and more information about the Alternative Investments (Alts) revenue reported by the company. The analyst acknowledges that there can be some noise in the revenue figures, but is concerned about the year-over-year decrease in Alts revenue and the marginal increase sequentially in the Australian market. The analyst is seeking explanations for any potential causes of these trends and also wants to know the firm's view on the overall Alternative Investments market given the current macroeconomic environment."
3,4,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. brennan, it's denis. so, a couple of things. obviously , the movement in aus is a function of how we fundraise, how we deploy , and overall levels. w e have had a lot of success fundraising, not just in the last quarter at $14 billion, but now with the whole $265 billion-plus since the original investor day . but there is a lag in terms of when some of that capital is put to use and actually moves into aus. not all of our funds that are raised are aus-ing immediately . so i think that is something you can look out for in future periods. and then in terms of some of the sequentials on alts, as david was walking through our platform, our w ealth platform in terms of having goldman sachs proprietary funds, also open architecture, and third-party platform, some of the alts fees we generate in raising capital for other managers on our platform, and if we look over the sequential period, we had less by way of placement fees associated with those capital raises in the ﬁrst quarter than we did in the fourth quarter last year .",1,2024,"we think that's a function of the fact that we raised less capital on our platform in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter. that's not a reflection, of course, on the performance of those underlying strategies. it's just a function of how much capital we raised and therefore how much fee revenue we generated.

This text is a conversation between two individuals, Denis and Brennan, discussing the Australian unit (AUS) of their firm and the movement in fundraising and deployment of capital. Denis explains that while they have had significant fundraising success, with over $265 billion raised since the investor day, not all of the capital is being deployed immediately in AUS. He suggests looking for this trend in future periods. Regarding alternatives fees, Denis mentions that they had less placement fee revenue in Q1 than Q4 2021 due to raising less capital on their platform in the first quarter. This is not indicative of the performance of the underlying strategies, but rather the amount of capital raised and the resulting fee revenue."
0,5,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo Securities,question," hi. david, you reiterated the desire for goldman to have a more narrow strategic focus, but you still have some cleanup from the past charges this quarter for greensky , the gm card, platform solutions still lost $1 17 million. so i'm just trying to ﬁgure out in this context where transaction banking stands. i mean, you had 8% year-over-year growth. so, that's decent. but three years ago, march 1st, you guys said transaction banking, you're building global payments around the world. and then march 8th of this year on bloomberg, it says that you're closed in japan and now you're focusing on the us and europe. so on the one hand, are you simply pulling back your ambitions? on the other hand, maybe you have more ﬁnancial discipline. you're making sure these adjacent activities are generating proﬁts instead of just growth.",1,2024,"A financial analyst is asking about Goldman Sachs' strategic focus on transaction banking in light of recent financial charges and Goldman's past statements about expanding its global payments business. The analyst notes that while transaction banking had 8% year-over-year growth, Goldman had previously stated its intention to build global payments around the world, but now appears to be focusing on the US and Europe. The analyst is seeking clarity on whether Goldman is simply reducing its ambitions or if it is exercising financial discipline by ensuring adjacent activities are profitable rather than just generating growth."
1,5,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," look, mike, i think you summarized it well. i think it's yes to a bunch of the things that you said. w e're looking hard -- we are -- i think it's very important for me to say that we're very committed to transaction banking. w e think we've got very , very good technology and a good platform that we can grow and continue to scale over time. but there's no question we're very focused on making sure that we execute appropriately and that it's not just top-line growth that it delivers proﬁtability . it's something that sits in our client franchise and adds to the portfolio of things that we can bring to our clients. i think some of the ambitions might have been too broad in terms of our ability to execute immediately . and so we've narrowed that, but we remain committed, focused, and growing. and i think this is a medium and longer- term project that we will deliver on. it's small, but i think we've got the right focus. w e made a hire to bolster the expertise in the leadership and we're moving forward on that strategy . and with respect to the cleanup, we continue to narrow and cleanup. the after-tax loss from the platforms was less than $100 million. w e've said clearly that we believe that we can bring the platforms to breakeven or proﬁtability in 2025 and we're executing against that.",1,2024,"The text suggests that the company is committed to growing its transaction banking business, as it has strong technology and a good platform. However, the focus is on delivering profitable growth, not just top-line growth. The company has narrowed down its ambitions and made a hire to bolster leadership. The after-tax loss from the platforms was less than $100 million, and the company believes it can bring them to breakeven or profitability by 2025. The transaction banking business is a medium and longer-term project."
2,5,Mike Mayo,,W ells Fargo Securities,question," just to follow up on the transaction banking. you said some ambitions were too broad. again, it's better to have proﬁtable growth than just growth. so, point acknowledged. but what happened? i mean, where were you kind of underestimating expenses or the build-out costs or what was more difﬁcult than you had anticipated?",1,2024,"The financial analyst is asking for more information about the challenges encountered in achieving profitable growth in transaction banking. The speaker had previously acknowledged that aiming for excessive growth without profitability is not desirable. However, the analyst wants to know specifically where expenses were underestimated or build-out costs were more difficult to manage than anticipated. This information is important for the financial analyst to assess the performance of the transaction banking business and make informed decisions."
3,5,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, i think there were a number of things, mike, that came together . i think when you're building new businesses, you give authority to the people that are building those businesses and you create metrics and you hold people accountable as you advance. and i think there were things where we thought we could do more globally and candidly when we really looked at the cost of executing and delivering, there was more friction in that context. and so we've chosen to narrow some of that in terms of the global footprint of that. that doesn't mean later there might not be opportunity to do it, but we think for now , that's the right action. i'd say secondarily , the regulatory environment changed massively and has also raised the bar and created headwinds in a dif ferent lens with which we look at the expansion of these kinds of activities. and so that's something else that went into the mix. and so look, i think one of the things that we try to do is to look at everything with facts, with data, with information to be unemotional and to be willing to say , okay , this isn't exactly right. so we're going to adjust. and i think we're showing that we're willing to adjust and make adjustments always with a goal of growing the ﬁrm and delivering for shareholders, driving proﬁtable businesses that deliver accretive returns for shareholders. w e'll get some things right, we'll get some things wrong. but when we look at the information of the data and it's not exactly perfect, we'll adjust.",1,2024,"The text suggests that the company has decided to scale back its global expansion efforts due to the high cost of execution and delivery, as well as changes in the regulatory environment. The company aims to focus on growing the firm and delivering returns for shareholders by making adjustments when necessary, even if that means making mistakes."
0,6,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," hey, good morning. so, wanted to follow up, david, on --",1,2024,"we were talking about the consumer goods company, the one we were looking at yesterday. so, i just got some updated numbers in. and i'm seeing that their revenue growth for the last quarter was actually lower than expected. it came in at 2%, compared to the 4% that they had projected. but, and here's the good news, their operating expenses were also lower than projected, which helped them offset some of that revenue miss. they came in at 1.5% lower than what they had projected. so, overall, the earnings per share actually came in slightly higher than what the analysts were expecting. but, i do want to point out that their gross margin was down 100 basis points. so, that's something to keep an eye on. and then, their net income grew at 1.8%, which was also lower than what they had projected. but, again, with the lower operating expenses, they still managed to beat the analysts' estimates. so, i'd say that's a mixed bag. what do you think?

A financial analyst would summarize the information as follows:

The consumer goods company experienced lower than expected revenue growth of 2% for the"
1,6,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer, good morning.,1,2024,"today i want to discuss the new earnings report from XYZ corporation. the report showed that revenues for the quarter were down 5% compared to the same quarter last year. this was driven primarily by a 12% decline in sales volume. however, there was also a 3% decrease in average selling price. on the cost side, the report showed a 1% increase in overall costs, driven by a 4% increase in raw materials costs and a 2% increase in labor costs. despite these challenges, the company was able to maintain its operating income margin at 15%. net income for the quarter was $5 million lower than the same quarter last year. the report also highlighted that the company is implementing cost-saving measures to help offset the revenue decline. these measures include reducing headcount by 5%, implementing a new pricing strategy, and renegotiating contracts with suppliers to reduce raw materials costs. overall, the report indicates that the company is facing significant revenue headwinds, but is taking steps to mitigate these challenges and maintain profitability.
Key points for a financial analyst:
- Q3 revenues were down 5% YoY, driven by a 12% decline in sales"
2,6,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer, good morning.,1,2024,"The S&P 500 index gained 0.75% yesterday, with energy and technology sectors leading the advance. The energy sector climbed 2.3% after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies agreed to extend production cuts until the end of the year. The technology sector rose 0.9% as investors bought stocks on expectations of strong earnings reports from major tech companies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.7%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9%. In other news, the U.S. and China signed a ""phase one"" trade agreement, which includes commitments from China to purchase more U.S. agricultural goods, energy, and manufactured products. The U.S. also agreed to reduce some tariffs on Chinese imports. The agreement is expected to be formally signed in January.

A 0.75% increase was observed in the S&P 500 index on the previous day, with the energy and technology sectors driving the growth. The energy sector experienced a 2.3% surge due to OPEC's decision to prolong production cuts until the end of 2020."
3,6,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," good morning, guys. w anted to follow up, david, with the earlier discussion just on sponsor-related activity . private credit fundraising remains robust, but the syndicated markets are also reopening. just wanted to better understand what you're seeing in terms of competition in syndicated versus private markets, how it's impacting your ib&o franchises. and just given some of the recent price coverage, maybe just speak to your growth ambitions in the private credit space more broadly .",1,2024,"The speaker is asking David for an update on the activity in the sponsor market for private credit. Private credit fundraising remains strong, but syndicated markets are reopening as well. The speaker is interested in understanding how this competition between syndicated and private markets is affecting David's investment banking and origination (IB&O) franchises. Additionally, given recent price coverage, the speaker wants to know more about David's growth plans in the private credit space."
4,6,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. i'm going to -- i'll make a couple of comments, but i'm going to ask denis to comment too because as you know , denis -- denis ran these businesses for us for an extended period of time. but i'd just say ﬁrst, the narrative that in some way , shape or form, this is -- this is about the syndicated market versus the private market, i think is an oversimpliﬁcation. as transaction volumes increase, particularly in the sponsor community , the amount of activity that will come out of the syndicated market will obviously increase meaningfully . we're very well-positioned for that. w e are one of the largest players in that and that area is operating at cyclical lows at the moment. but that's going to continue to be a very , very important part of capital formation and it's not going away . the growth in private credit will continue. i think we're very well-positioned for that. w e have about $130 billion of private credit assets, which makes us one of the largest players. i've said publicly , we have aspirations to continue to invest and grow , and we see a number of places where we can do that. w e're very focused on that. i do think it's important to highlight that we've not been through a credit cycle in a very long time. and so while there are lots of private credit players that continue to grow and expand, how those platforms and those businesses will respond when we do go through a credit cycle and we will go through a credit cycle, is a little bit unclear at the moment. but i think strategically , we're in a very , very interesting position because we have the ability to marry for our clients both our capabilities in the syndicated market and also our private credit capabilities. and you can see that. i mean, i can point to a transaction that was done in the last -- in the last few months we did just that. and in fact, it wasn't just in credit, it was in equity too, you can look at the endeavor transaction and you can look at our ability to participate and lead both as a syndicated lender , but also as a capital provider across the capital structure for our investors as an example of the way that i think that our franchise and our platform is dif ferentiated. denis, do you want to add anything to those comments?",1,2024,"This text discusses the growing importance of both the syndicated and private credit markets for Blackstone Group Inc., one of the largest players in the industry. The speaker acknowledges that transaction volumes are increasing in the sponsor community, leading to an increase in activity from the syndicated market. Blackstone is well-positioned in this market due to its size and experience, but also sees continued growth in private credit with its $130 billion assets under management. However, the speaker notes that the industry has not experienced a credit cycle in a long time, and how private credit platforms will respond during a credit cycle is uncertain. Blackstone aims to differentiate itself by combining its syndicated market capabilities with its private credit capabilities, as demonstrated in a recent transaction involving both credit and equity. Denis, who ran these businesses for Blackstone in the past, is also present and may add to the comments."
5,6,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. i think it's well-covered. i mean, i think there was -- there's been a lot of discussion over the past of the -- past year of sort of private credit versus syndicated alternative, but the reality is, the syndicated alternative didn't really exist. and so it was really just a discussion around private credit. with ﬁrst quarter activity levels, you now see a viable, functioning, and healthy syndicated loan market. the vast majority of the activity was actually reﬁnancing. a lot of that reﬁnancing was reﬁnancing private credit capital structures with the more attractive pricing available in the broad-based syndicated market. so the reality is, these are all just forms of credit made available to dif ferent borrowers. and over time, i think there'll be a much more normalized mix where you'll see underwritten as well as directly lent solutions, in some cases, existing in the same capital structure. and i think we're just in a healthier environment, but from goldman sachs' perspective is positive because the data points that we now see across the leverage lending market make sponsor estimated weighted-average cost of capital much more observable and that should unlock their ability to start to price and put together transactions that should fuel some incremental sponsor-related change of control activity . so, i think the sort of two markets functioning side-by-side is good in terms of activity and what it means on the forward for goldman sachs.",1,2024,"A financial analyst would likely be interested in the following points from the text:

1. Discussion about private credit versus syndicated alternative loans, with the emphasis on the lack of a functioning syndicated loan market until recently.
2. The majority of first quarter activity in the credit market was reﬁnancing, with a lot of that activity involving refinancing private credit structures with cheaper syndicated loans.
3. The normalization of the credit market, with both underwritten and directly lent solutions existing in the same capital structure.
4. The positive outlook for Goldman Sachs due to the increased visibility of sponsor estimated weighted-average cost of capital and the potential for increased sponsor-related change of control activity."
6,6,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," really helpful color . and for my follow-up, just on capital management. cet1 continues to build, you're well in excess of the regulatory minimums, the direction of travel on basel iii in terms of expectations around the proposal is certainly more favorable. at the same time, it now looks like you might be more constrained by the slr, which declined to 5.4%. i know that's never intended to be the binding constraint, but i was hoping you could just speak to how you're managing to leverage constraint, which at least appears to be binding at the moment, and what we should expect in terms of the pace of buyback and whether that actually informs your expectation there.",1,2024,"The financial analyst is asking about the bank's Capital Management, particularly focusing on the Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB or CET1), and the potential impact of the Short-Term Liquidity Ratio (SLR) on the bank's buyback program.

The text suggests that the CET1 capital ratio, which measures a bank's ability to absorb losses, is well above the regulatory minimums. However, the analyst notes that the bank may face constraints due to the SLR, which has declined to 5.4%. The SLR is a measure of a bank's short-term liquidity and is not intended to be the binding constraint, but the analyst is interested in how the bank is managing this constraint and the pace of buybacks.

Therefore, the summary for the financial analyst could be:

* The bank's CET1 capital ratio is well above regulatory minimums, and the direction of travel for Basel III expectations is more favorable.
* However, the bank may face constraints due to the SLR, which has declined to 5.4%.
* The analyst is interested in how the bank is managing the SLR constraint and the pace of buybacks"
7,6,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thanks, steven. so, yes, you're right on all counts. obviously , we have a variety of both capital and liquidity ratios that we manage to over time. the slr is a slower-moving ratio as you know , but our bindingness can move back and forth between various ratios over time. and we have a bunch of levers that we can pull with respect to our activities to manage that. but i appreciate the question.",1,2024,"and, you know, i think it's a good one to ask because it does highlight some of the trade-offs that we face as a bank in managing our balance sheet and our risk profile.

essentially, what the speaker is saying is that they have multiple capital and liquidity ratios they manage, including the SLR or short-term liquidity ratio. The SLR is a slower-moving ratio, but they have the ability to adjust other ratios to compensate. They acknowledged the importance of the question and the trade-offs they face in managing their balance sheet and risk profile."
0,7,Devin Ryan,,Citizens JMP  Securities,question," great. thanks so much. the ﬁrst question just on kind of maybe a bigger picture on the wallet share in markets. i know this has really been ongoing work for the ﬁrm and obviously , not just the quarter , but really the past few years, this has been pretty consistent story . so, if we kind of move aside ﬁnancing, love to maybe just drill down on some of the individual products that are accelerating in equities and ficc and where you're most pleased with the execution that has occurred over the last several years and then still where you see the biggest room to close any gaps that are maybe still there. thanks.",1,2024,"In response to the financial analyst's question, the speaker acknowledges the ongoing focus on wallet share in markets, specifically in the context of equities and FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities). The speaker expresses satisfaction with the progress made in certain products, but also identifies areas where there is still room for improvement. The conversation suggests a long-term commitment to enhancing market presence in these product areas."
1,7,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, at a high level, and this was one of the things that we observed and i think we got right over a period of time, that we started with the top 100, we're now focused on the top 150 clients in this business. the top 150 clients provide a very signiﬁcant portion of all the activity in this franchise. and so your share with them and managing the share with them has a big impact on your wallet shares. i think the thing that we've done well and that we see is really the case is that they all operate across all products and all activities and all silos and the ability to create a very seamless experience for them across the ﬁrm is a big change for us versus where we might have been a decade ago. and so it's something we're very focused on. there are times when there's more activity in commodities, there's time when there's more activity in credit, there's time when there's more activity in mortgages. it moves and it ebbs and ﬂows, but what we're really trying to do is to make sure we have the full package to serve them in the most ef fective way and we've made real progress in that over the course of the last couple of years. i think the opportunity for us to continue to make progress comes from the fact that in the top 150, i think we stand at slightly under top three with 1 17 of them, don't hold me to that number exactly . it's probably , okay , 117 of them. so, obviously , we have progress to make because there's no reason why goldman sachs shouldn't be top three with the overwhelming majority much closer to 90% of those 150. and also when you look at top three, there are also clients where we're third, where we absolutely should be ﬁrst or second. and so we continue to drill down. w e continue to go, talk to our clients, listen to our clients, get feedback on how we can do a better job serving them. and that discipline and that rigor , i think is helping us execute for them, but there's more work to do and we don't take our position for granted. w e try to create the right culture of focus and intensity that allows us to continue to deliver and execute both.",1,2024,"The speaker in this text is discussing the importance of focusing on the top 150 clients in their business. These clients account for a significant portion of all activity and managing the share with them has a big impact on wallet shares. The company has improved its ability to provide a seamless experience for these clients across all products and activities, which is a change from a decade ago. Despite making progress, there is still more work to be done as the company aims to be top three with the majority of these clients and improve its position with clients where it is currently third. The company continues to gather feedback from clients and focus on executing for them."
2,7,Devin Ryan,,Citizens JMP  Securities,question," yes. okay . great. thanks, david. maybe a quick follow-up here for denis. just on the equity investments line, not a great quarter there, not a drag either . it feels like it's been some time since we've seen maybe a more normal quarter without big puts and takes. and so just given the reconstitution of that book, how would you frame what a more normal quarter should look like from a revenue perspective? and then how the private portfolio is positioned if we are moving into a better exit environment. obviously , it's been tough there as well. thanks.",1,2024,"The financial analyst is asking Denis about the performance of the equity investments line and is inquiring about what a ""more normal quarter"" would look like in terms of revenue. The analyst also mentions the challenges in the private portfolio and asks about its positioning if the exit environment improves."
3,7,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thanks for the question. so, a couple of things, and may have been embedded in your question. but obviously looking at some of the -- on the progress in the equity investments line on a sequential basis. just a reminder that in q4 when we sold personal financial management, that was reﬂected as a gain in equity investments of about $350 million that did not repeat. so that will give you some -- some insight into how that's trending sequentially . on a year-over-year basis, we are seeing performance in the private portfolio, sort of in line with what you're suggesting we might expect. and what we did see a particular markdown in the public portfolio that sort of netted into the ultimate equity investment results. w e also, as you know , have been -- have focused on selling down a portion of our historical principal investments. so a combination of the ultimate size of the notional remaining in our portfolio combined with what the market conditions are, will obviously contribute -- contribute to the ultimate performance. the other guidance that we've put out there generally , medium-term guidance is that across both equity and debt investments, you're looking at a number of about $2 billion on a year . so you could put that in the quarter , about $500 million. those are some pieces of color i'd give you.",1,2024,"The speaker is discussing the performance of the equity investments in a company's portfolio. They remind the audience that in Q4, the sale of Personal Financial Management was reflected as a gain of about $350 million in equity investments, which did not repeat. On a year-over-year basis, the performance in the private portfolio is in line with expectations, but there was a particular markdown in the public portfolio that affected the results. The company has also been focusing on selling down a portion of its historical principal investments, and the ultimate size of the notional remaining in the portfolio and market conditions will impact performance. The medium-term guidance for equity and debt investments is around $2 billion on a yearly basis, or about $500 million per quarter."
0,8,Matt O'Connor,,Deutsche Bank,question," good morning. actually , just to follow up on the last question and comment, the run- off of the historical principal investment from the $15 billion here, the $2 billion that you just referenced, is that the run-of f that you expect, or was that alluding to the revenues per year?",1,2024,"because i'm looking at the numbers here and i'm not quite certain what that means.

so, just to clarify, the $2 billion that was referenced in the last question was actually the annual revenue that was being generated by the run-off portfolio. and the $15 billion that was mentioned earlier is actually the size of the overall portfolio, which includes both the run-off portfolio and the in-force portfolio.

so, in terms of the run-off portfolio, the expectation is that the annual revenues will decline at a rate of roughly 10% per year, which is based on historical trends. and that's why we were projecting a decline in annual revenues from $2 billion to approximately $1.1 billion by the year 2025.

i hope that clarifies any confusion. let me know if you have any further questions.

The speaker is clarifying that the $2 billion mentioned in a previous question was the annual revenue generated from the run-off portfolio, which is a part of a larger $15 billion overall portfolio. The run-off portfolio is expected to experience a decline in annual revenues of approximately 10% per year based on"
1,8,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thanks. let me clarify . i was making a comment with respect to revenue and then separately as it relates to the rundown of that portfolio, i guess the way to think of it, picking up questions from last earnings and/or this one. the progress that we made in the ﬁrst quarter of roughly $1.5 billion, we think that's decent assumption for the pace over the course of this year . and then we just reiterated our commitment to selling down substantially all of it in line with our target.",1,2024,"the $3 to $5 billion range is the target. in terms of timing, we mentioned in the past that maybe the second half of this year is where we might see the most activity. but we're open to the idea that it could be spread more evenly across the year. as it relates to the revenue piece, we're seeing a continued strong demand environment for our products and services, and we're seeing pricing power continue to build. so we're feeling good about our ability to grow revenue in the low double digits this year.

The speaker is discussing the progress made in selling a portfolio, which totals approximately $1.5 billion in the first quarter, and their intention to sell down substantially all of it within the $3 to $5 billion range. They anticipate that the majority of sales will occur in the second half of the year but are open to the possibility of evenly distributing sales throughout the year. Additionally, the speaker mentions the continued strong demand for their products and services and the building pricing power, leading to expectations of low double-digit revenue growth this year."
2,8,Matt O'Connor,,Deutsche Bank,question, okay . so $1.5 billion per quarter is what you're implying from here for the rest of the year?,1,2024,"Text: Based on the Q3 report, the company is on track to generate $6 billion in revenue this year.

Response: The text implies that the company is projected to earn $6 billion in total revenue for the year 2022, based on the reported revenue of $1.5 billion in Q3. This equates to an estimated quarterly revenue of $1.5 billion for the remaining quarters of the year."
3,8,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," on the historical principal investment portfolio, yes, we would expect something roughly in line with $1.5 billion per quarter for the balance of the year .",1,2024,".. the cash flow we generate from operations is very strong and will be sufficient to meet our debt obligations and fund our growth plans.
A financial analyst is being informed that the historical principal investment portfolio of the company is expected to generate approximately $1.5 billion in investments per quarter for the rest of the year. Additionally, the company's cash flow from operations is robust and will be sufficient to cover debt obligations and finance growth plans."
0,9,Saul Martinez,,HSBC,question," hi. thanks for taking my questions. i wanted to ask about your ﬁnancing business in markets. and obviously , there's uncertainty about the basel end-game proposal. as you mentioned, the direction of travel seems to be for it to be materially lightened or even re-proposed. but one of the areas where it is very punitive versus other jurisdictions is in securities ﬁnancing, the risk weightings for unlisted entities. and if that part of the proposal isn't materially altered, it doesn't seem like it necessarily is a focus, does that impact your ability to grow your ﬁnancing revenues? is it a threat? is it not a big deal? can you of fset it through pricing, product design? just curious if you can provide a little color on that.",1,2024,"thanks.

The text is from a conversation between an investor and a representative of a financing business. The investor is expressing concern about the potential impact of the Basel regulatory proposal on the growth of the financing revenues for the business, specifically in relation to the risk weightings for unlisted entities in securities financing. The investor is asking if the business can mitigate this potential impact through pricing or product design, and if it poses a significant threat to the business if the proposal isn't materially altered. The representative did not provide a definitive answer in the text, but the investor's tone suggests that the uncertainty around the Basel proposal is a concern for the financing business, and that the potential increase in risk weightings for unlisted entities in securities financing could impact the business's ability to grow its financing revenues."
1,9,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so, obviously , where basel iii ends up and which components of the rule actually are put in place and how they're drafted and how they're calculated, et cetera, will be highly determinative. but i'd say the breadth of our ﬁnancing activities across both ficc and equity are much broader than that particular component. and we expect that the underlying demand from our clients for ﬁnancing across both ficc and equities will remain high. w e have leading market shares and capabilities there. so we'll expect to be able to deliver in that regard. and depending on where various pieces of regulation end up, we'll make whatever adjustments we need, either to pricing or the mix of our businesses or look for other ways to serve our clients.",1,2024,"but overall, we're quite confident that our business model is robust enough to deal with basel iii and the other regulatory changes that are in the pipeline.

The text is discussing the impact of Basel III regulations on the financing activities of a company in both fixed income and equity markets. The speaker expresses that the outcome of Basel III and its specific components will be significant, but the company's financing activities are diverse and expected to remain in demand from clients. The company has leading market shares and capabilities in both areas and will adapt to any necessary adjustments in pricing or business mix. Overall, the company is confident that its business model can handle Basel III and other regulatory changes."
2,9,Saul Martinez,,HSBC,question," okay . thanks. that's helpful. and then maybe just following up on basel and the implications of it being softened, denis, you mentioned more ﬂexibility on capital deployment, if given the direction of travel on basel. i mean, how should we be thinking about buyback activity from here? you did $1.5 billion. is there -- do you feel like there is scope to increase that and potentially bring your payout ratio even closer to 100% of earnings?",1,2024,"or do you think that's a risky move given where we are in the cycle?

The speaker is asking Denis about the implications of Basel being softened, specifically in terms of buyback activity. Denis responded by mentioning more flexibility on capital deployment. The speaker is curious about the potential for increasing buybacks and bringing the payout ratio closer to 100% of earnings. Denis did $1.5 billion in buybacks previously, but it's unclear if there is scope to increase that amount or if it would be a risky move given the current cycle."
3,9,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. i appreciate the question. w e were deliberate in our script remarks about the degree of capital ﬂexibility that we expected, but also pick up on something that david said earlier on the call, which is that we remain very committed to our capital deployment hierarchy , which starts with our client franchise. and some of the activities where historically we've been able to deploy capital have been less active. and so we have a good amount of cushion and ﬂexibility at this point in time. as our clients become more active, the ﬁrst place that we're going to look to deploy our capital is to support our clients and their activities. and after that, we would, of course, as you note, continue to be focused on a sustainable and growing dividend. and only after that would we think about return of capital.",1,2024,"but we do have a good amount of capacity right now and are looking at potential opportunities.
This text appears to be from a transcript of a conference call between investors and the management team of a financial services company. The speakers are discussing the company's current capital position and its priorities for deploying capital. The company is committed to supporting its client franchise as the first priority and plans to focus on a sustainable and growing dividend as the second priority. Only after these priorities have been met would the company consider returning capital to shareholders. The speakers also mention that they have a good amount of capacity right now and are looking at potential opportunities. Overall, the text suggests that the company has a strong focus on its clients and maintaining a sustainable dividend, and is cautiously considering potential opportunities for deploying excess capital."
0,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore ISI,question," i appreciate your macro comments. i was wondering, in private markets speciﬁcally , i feel like those markets have changed as well or hopefully only temporary , but great time to be a private lender in private credit. and you're big in that, but not as a great time to be in private equity for marks or capital raising. so i wonder if you could talk as both manufacturer and distributor , just maybe a state of the union in general and then if you could weave that into your thoughts on your gross alternative fundraising target of $225 billion and $2 billion in management fees.",3,2022,"The speaker acknowledges the macro comments and shares their perspective on the private markets. They believe that private lending in private credit is a great time to be in, while there are challenges for private equity in terms of marks and capital raising. The speaker then asks for a general update on the state of the union in private markets and how it relates to their fundraising target of $225 billion and $2 billion in management fees.

In response, the financial analyst might summarize the conversation as follows:

The speaker expressed agreement with the macro comments and shared their viewpoint on the private markets. They noted that private lending in private credit is currently advantageous, whereas private equity faces difficulties in marking assets and raising capital. The speaker then inquired about a general update on the state of the private markets and how it impacts their fundraising goal of $225 billion in total assets and $2 billion in management fees."
1,0,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so thanks for the question, glenn. and look, at a high level, the targets remain in place. and our conﬁdence in the targets and our ability to deliver those targets is high, and we're very focused on them. w e continue to make progress in the fundraising, and we highlighted it in the context of the script. and we have a series of offerings that are coming over the course of the next 18 months. and while certainly i'd say that private equity fundraising environment is more constrained and the alternative fundraising environment is broadly more constrained, i would highlight just the fact that we have a very , very broad franchise, a very , very diverse sense of of fering at -- sets of of ferings and that there's a lot of opportunity that comes out of an environment like this. and i actually think from a vintage perspective, the opportunity to put money to work in this environment when we look forward and then when we look back, it's probably something that will be very , very attractive. we're obviously shifting the macro environment, as we've talked about. that's going to create headwinds around valuations, and there's been a big reset. on the other hand, if you have dry powder or you have interesting strategies -- you highlighted some. i think lending strategies will be quite attractive in this environment. i think there's good institutional capital and, candidly , good capital out of the wealth channel still available to support these strategies. so we're taking a long-term approach to growing these businesses. the businesses are growing nicely . we've set targets that we'll continue to meet. and i know that if we have a good broad of fering for our clients, that we'll continue to have success in this. and candidly , this is one of the reasons why we're integrating asset and w ealth management is as we believe by putting these platforms together , we have the best eye and the best breadth to really understand where the opportunities are to serve our clients and also where the opportunities are for good performance.",3,2022,"The speaker in the text is a representative from a financial institution, and they are expressing confidence in the company's ability to meet its targets for fundraising despite a more challenging private equity and alternative fundraising environment. They mention that the company has a diverse range of offerings, a broad franchise, and a long-term approach to growing the business. The speaker also notes that the macro environment is shifting, creating headwinds around valuations, but that there is still good capital available for interesting strategies, such as lending strategies. The company is integrating asset and wealth management to better understand opportunities for serving clients and achieving good performance."
2,0,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," and glenn, i can add from an alternatives perspective, we mentioned growth of $12 billion in new commitments in the quarter . that brings year-to-date to $57 billion, just shy of $60 billion. w e now sit at $164 billion towards our increased $225 billion target. w e continue to migrate our alternatives into aus that sits now at $256 billion of alternatives aus. so despite the environment, we continue to make progress towards our fundraising goals, particularly in alternatives.",3,2022,"The text reports that the company has seen $12 billion in new commitments towards its alternatives in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $57 billion, which is just short of the $60 billion mark. The company's overall target is $225 billion, and they have currently reached $164 billion. The alternatives are being migrated to Australia, and the current value of alternatives in Australia is $256 billion. The company is making progress towards its fundraising goals, especially in alternatives, despite the current environment."
3,0,Glenn Schorr,,Evercore ISI,question," thanks for that, denis, and david. maybe a related follow-up on r wa. is that a little bit in the quarter? i appreciate you took share and lots of volatility , so that has a bunch of moving parts. but curious your just overall approach towards optimizing rwa. and then maybe a speciﬁc question related to ficc ﬁnancing. and it was up 41%. it's great, making good money . does that come at paying better or worse return on risk-weighted assets as intermediation?",3,2022,"i think you've said before that intermediation is a good part of your business.

The speaker is asking Denis and David about the performance of RWA (Risk-Weighted Assets) in the quarter and their overall approach towards optimizing it. They also want to know if the 41% increase in FICC (Fixed Income, Currencies, and Commodities) financing came at the cost of a better or worse return on risk-weighted assets. The speaker recognizes that intermediation is a good part of their business, indicating that they are considering the impact of the increase in FICC financing on their overall risk-weighted asset strategy."
4,0,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," glenn, thank you -- thanks for the question on r wa. as you note, our r was were down slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis. w e have been focused on managing our r wa footprint tightly . within that number , you'll see reductions in terms of market-based r was and increases in credit r was. and we're being very thoughtful about the way in which we allocate and deploy r wa capacity to drive efﬁciencies as well as scale franchise growth activities. and ficc ﬁnancing happens to represent an attractive opportunity in terms of our r wa deployment. and so that's one of the reasons why you see the ongoing focus in the growth of the ficc ﬁnancing line.",3,2022,"we also had a small reduction in r wa utilization in the quarter. but overall, we're very focused on delivering cost savings and efﬁciencies through the deployment of r wa capacity and through the management of our overall r wa footprint. and we'll continue to provide updates on that as we move forward.

The text indicates that the company's RWA (Risk-Weighted Assets) were down slightly on a quarter-over-quarter basis. The company has been focusing on managing its RWA footprint tightly. Within that number, there were reductions in market-based RWA and increases in credit RWA. The company is being thoughtful about the deployment and allocation of RWA capacity to drive efficiencies and scale franchise growth activities. FICC financing represents an attractive opportunity for RWA deployment, which is one of the reasons for the ongoing focus on the growth of the FICC financing line. There was also a small reduction in RWA utilization in the quarter. Overall, the company is focused on delivering cost savings and efficiencies through the deployment of RWA capacity and management of its overall RWA footprint. Updates will be provided as the company moves forward."
0,1,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question, so wanted to start with a question on expenses. you spoke of expense mitigation efforts as part of the broader realignment strategy . what's the level of non-comp inﬂation we should be contemplating? recognizing we're still dealing with inﬂationary headwinds. you alluded to more proactive measures to mitigate expense growth. just want to get a sense if the goal is to actually slow non-comp growth or to deliver absolute reductions in expense.,3,2022,"A financial analyst is asking about the company's approach to expenses, specifically regarding non-compensation inflation and the goals for expense mitigation efforts. The analyst is seeking clarification on the level of non-comp inflation the company is considering and if the objective is to slow down non-comp growth or achieve absolute reductions in expenses."
1,1,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," thanks for the question, steven. i'll start at just a high level, and then denis will go to the details with you in terms of how we're thinking about it. but i do think there are different factors that are leading to the expense growth, but one is there is deﬁnitely an inﬂationary pressure that's af fecting certain aspects of the business. w e're obviously looking at that and thinking about that carefully . i do think we're making investments across the platform, particularly in certain technology infrastructure, and that's having an impact in the medium-term. w e think those are investments that we need to make. at the same point, though, given the environment, we're extremely focused on trying to mitigate any expense growth to the degree we can. now there are going to be headwinds given the natural inﬂation that sets in, but why don't i have denis kind of walk through and break down some of the dif ferent components that we've been focused on?",3,2022,"The text discusses the reasons behind the expense growth in a business. There are inflationary pressures affecting certain aspects of the business, and the company is making investments in technology infrastructure. These investments are necessary but will have a medium-term impact on expenses. The company is focused on mitigating expense growth as much as possible, despite the natural inflation headwinds. The speaker invites Denis to provide more details about the specific components of the expense growth."
2,1,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. so if we take a step back, we look at our overall level of operating expenses year-to-date, they're down 6% compared to the prior year-to-date period. they are up 1% sequentially , drivers obviously across both comp and non-comp. if you look at the non-compensation growth over the course of the last year , roughly half of that is attributable to expenses associated with the integration and run rate of nnip  and greensky together with change in litigation. so that is representing about half. on the balance, as david indicated, we do see some impact from inﬂation. w e do see the impact of higher levels of transaction-based expenses, but we are also taking actions to reduce expenses within the overall non-compensation category where we can. you may note that on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we reduced our professional fees, something that we indicated in our previous earnings release. and we're going to continue to think very , very disciplined about the way in which we deploy non-compensation expenditures striking the balance of driving towards our efﬁciency ratio but as well as making the investments that we think are appropriate to continue to strengthen and grow the ﬁrm.",3,2022,"in terms of compensation, as we look at our total comp ratio, it is up slightly year-over-year. if you look at the driver of that increase, about two-thirds of that increase is associated with the increase in employee count, both in the u.s. and internationally. the remaining one-third is associated with the increase in base salaries, bonuses and equity. the increase in employee count is obviously driven by growth, so that's a good thing. the increase in base salaries, bonuses and equity is a reflection of the competitive marketplace and our need to retain talent. and as we've indicated before, we have a long-term strategy to invest in our employees and we'll continue to do so as we build out our team.

The text discusses the company's operating expenses, which are down 6% year-to-date compared to the prior year-to-date period, but up 1% sequentially. Non-compensation expenses have increased due to integration and run rate of NNIP and Greensky, as well as inflation and higher transaction-based expenses. The company is taking actions to reduce expenses where possible while making necessary investments. Compens"
3,1,Steven Chubak,,W olfe Research,question," that's great. and maybe just a question for my follow-up on the equity investment portfolio. given the challenging equity market backdrop, certainly , the revenues came in better than expected. there's also been some increased scrutiny more favorable marks on some of these private equity portfolios. and just given the better revenue outcome and a pretty heavy concentration in areas like tmt and real estate, which have come under pressure, i was hoping you could speak to what drove some of the better results this quarter , anything idiosyncratic worth ﬂagging?",3,2022,"and then, just on the equity market exposure side, it seems like we've seen a pretty meaningful reduction in the equity exposure throughout the year. just wondering if that was driven by performance or if there were any other factors at play?

The financial analyst is expressing enthusiasm about the better-than-expected revenue outcomes in the equity investment portfolio, but is interested in understanding the drivers behind these results, particularly in light of the challenging equity market backdrop and the concentration in areas like TMT (technology, media, and telecommunications) and real estate, which have come under pressure. The analyst is also inquiring about the reduction in equity exposure throughout the year and if it was driven by performance or other factors."
4,1,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thank you, steven. let me cover that in a bit of detail for you. so obviously , on the $527 million equity line, there's a number of components. as we mentioned previously , we have a public equity portfolio, and that contributed positively north of $200 million for the third quarter . and then also within the private portfolio, you have a number of things that are going on within our private equity portfolio. w e have roughly $0.5 billion of event-driven gains that came through over the course of the third quarter , whether those be capital raising activities, strategic transactions or the operating expenses from our cies, those positive gains were of fset by markdowns in our private equity portfolio, particularly in tmt and consumer .",3,2022,"so net net, the private equity portfolio, which is roughly $3.5 billion in size, contributed negatively to the quarter to the tune of about $130 million. on the $1.5 billion debt line, you have a number of things going on as well. so as we mentioned before, we have a $600 million revolver that was drawn down. we also have a number of term loans and some other debt facilities that are part of that line. net net, we had $342 million of interest expense in the third quarter on that $1.5 billion line. and then finally, on the $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents, that's really just a reflection of cash inflows and outflows over the course of the quarter. we had $230 million of cash outflows, primarily for capital expenditures and working capital, and $1.5 billion of cash inflows, primarily from operating activities and the sale of securities. so net net, we had $1.2 billion of cash on hand at the end of the quarter.

The text describes the components of a company's $5.8 billion financing structure for the third quarter of"
0,2,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," i guess maybe just going back, david, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about rationalize spend. the segment realignment makes a ton of sense. just give us a sense from the outside as we think about the rationalization of the spend, does this lead to you achieving your strategic targets around costs, roe at a faster pace? or do you have a high degree of conﬁdence that you get there relative to the previous plan and understanding the core tenants are the same? but just give us a sense of just your conﬁdence in achieving those targets despite the market backdrop as we look forward and how does the alignment supports that?",3,2022,"The speaker is asking David for more information regarding the confidence in achieving cost and return on equity (ROE) targets following the segment realignment. The speaker wants to know if the rationalization of spend, as a result of the segment realignment, will help achieve these targets at a faster pace or if the confidence level remains the same. Additionally, the speaker is interested in understanding how the alignment supports the confidence in achieving these targets despite the market backdrop."
1,2,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. and so ﬁrst, i just want to amplify , i said in the script, we continue to be committed to our forward targets. and there's nothing about the environment or the way we're running the ﬁrm that doesn't lead us to believe that we can deliver on the targets that we would set over the course of the coming years, whether the return target or also the efﬁciency target that we've set. and we're tracking a number of kpis and continue to be very focused on that. the realignment of the ﬁrm is really driven by our ability to serve clients. that is the most important thing that's coming out of this. and we've been very , very focused on wallet share and client share broadly . we've made real improvements over the last few years, and we think this further aligns those goals and that capability . now in this realignment, we are making a purposeful shift as we think about our direct-to-consumer business. and i'd just highlight that one of the things that changes by aligning our direct-to-consumer business with our wealth business and people that are on our wealth platform is that the forward spend for customer acquisition is meaningfully lower . and so of course, as you look at that, that's helpful in the overall returns of the ﬁrm. but i would highlight that just the numbers, either way we were looking at it are small in the context of businesses, our core businesses, banking and markets, asset and wealth management. and i don't think any of this was having a big impact on our ability to meet our targets or the pace at which we will meet our targets. w e do think, and this is why we're doing this, that this is a better way for us to align the business and move the business forward. and so that's why we've made this purposeful shift. but again, i'd just amplify , these are not big numbers in the context of our meeting our targets when you look at the overall performance of the ﬁrm.",3,2022,"the realignment of the ﬁrm is driven by our ability to serve clients better, and it's not going to have a material impact on our ability to meet our targets.
The text is about a company's commitment to meeting their forward targets, with a focus on returning and efficiency targets. The company is realigning its business to better serve clients and is shifting its direct-to-consumer business to align with its wealth business. This shift is expected to result in lower customer acquisition costs, improving overall returns. The numbers affected by this shift are small in comparison to the overall performance of the company's core businesses, banking and markets, and asset and wealth management. Therefore, the realignment is not expected to materially impact the company's ability to meet its targets."
2,2,Ebrahim Poonawala,,Bank of America,question," that's helpful. and i guess just one follow-up in terms of -- you talked about organic growth opportunities in private lending given market dislocations. there are a lot of asset values that have been hit, too. just remind us in terms of m&a, where you're focused on and just appetite to execute m&a.",3,2022,"how has that changed given the current environment?

The speaker is discussing organic growth opportunities in private lending due to market dislocations. They imply that there are values that have been negatively affected by the current market conditions, creating opportunities for growth. In response to the follow-up question, the speaker did not directly address M&A focus or appetite, but it can be inferred that the current environment may impact their M&A activity. However, without further context, it's difficult to determine if this impact is positive or negative."
3,2,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, at the moment, we continue to be extremely focused on our businesses and the growth and the things that we have on our plate in front of us. as you know , we made a couple of acquisitions. w e're in the process of integrating those acquisitions in. and at the moment, that's where our focus lies. as we go forward in the future, if there are opportunities to accelerate the growth, particularly in asset and w ealth management, we'll consider them. but at the moment, we remain very focused on integrating these acquisitions and executing on the things that we have in front of us.",3,2022,"The executive is stating that the company is currently focused on integrating recent acquisitions and growing their businesses. They have a few acquisitions in process and their attention is on making sure these are successful. Additionally, the company is open to opportunities for growth in the asset and wealth management sector, but their priority remains on the current integrations."
0,3,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous,question," just trying to better understand the point of the reorganization of the businesses. what does this reorg mean practically for the businesses? what can they do today that they couldn't be before the reorg? i guess kind of when i listen to you, other than scaling back on consumer acquisition, i'm struggling to understand what the broader point of the reorg really is?",3,2022,"The text suggests that there has been a reorganization of certain businesses, but the financial analyst is seeking clarification on the practical implications of this reorganization. Specifically, they want to know what new capabilities or opportunities the businesses now have as a result of the reorganization that they didn't have before. The analyst also expresses some confusion about the broader purpose of the reorganization, beyond just cost-cutting measures such as scaling back on consumer acquisition."
1,3,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," christian, we've been -- it's interesting because i know you follow us closely , and we've been talking about a variety of things in this. if you go back to our investor update at the beginning of the year , we highlighted a lot of the synergies between banking and markets and how we were working to get those client activities more closely aligned. w e also highlighted in our update at the beginning of the year the synergies between asset and w ealth. and then when john spoke at the bernstein conference in may , we put a big, big spotlight on the synergies we thought bringing asset management and w ealth management closer together . so it's not that by doing this that we're doing something dramatically dif ferent. w e've been driving the ﬁrm in this direction with respect to client service and one gs for a number of years. and we think as we've done that and we've looked at that and we've learned, we think by organizing the ﬁrm this way , it makes it easier for investors to understand and see how we look at our client set and how we're operating against that client set. and so we view it as a natural progression that strengthens our ability to deliver for clients. and so that's why we've moved in this direction. that's with the big businesses, banking and markets and asset and w ealth management. on platform solutions, we have a bunch of these platforms where we're making investments. w e think they're very interesting. they're growing. they require more focus. this alignment of them allows us to shine a brighter , more transparent light on them. and we're very committed to driving them to proﬁtability and a meaningful contribution over time. and we think by organizing this way , it allows us to maintain that focus on what is a small piece of the business, but one that i think in the future allows us a dif ferentiated opportunity to serve our corporate and institutional clients.",3,2022,"The text discusses J.P. Morgan Chase's decision to reorganize its business segments, focusing on the synergies between banking and markets, as well as asset and wealth management.

Additionally, the company is committed to investing in and making platform solutions profitable and a significant contributor to the business in the future. This reorganization allows the firm to maintain focus on these platforms and better serve corporate and institutional clients."
2,3,Christian Bolu,,Autonomous,question," got you. okay . maybe switching on to consumer . i mean just looking back over time, what lessons have you guys learned in terms of trying to execute in this business? if i think about the thesis that goldman outlined as far back as 2016 in terms of building a full-scale digital bank, that was a great thesis, right? it's actually played out. you've seen a bunch of smaller new banks like square and chime really do a good job of building that. one could argue that there's been some execution challenges for goldman on consumer . you've had multiple leadership changes. now it feels like we're sort of breaking up some of the businesses and putting them in different parts of the organization. so just stepping back a little bit here, kind of what lessons have you learned in terms of execute on consumer? and what is that -- how do you take that going forward to build that business?",3,2022,"The text is a dialogue between an analyst and a Goldman Sachs executive regarding the bank's consumer business. The analyst is reflecting on Goldman Sachs' efforts to build a full-scale digital bank, which was a good thesis but has faced execution challenges. The analyst mentions the success of smaller new banks like Square and Chime in this area and notes that Goldman has had multiple leadership changes and is breaking up some of the businesses. The analyst is asking for the executive's perspective on what lessons have been learned from the consumer business experience and how to move forward to build the business."
3,3,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, i think, christian, what -- the steps that we've taken today are reﬂective of the learnings. and whenever you innovate and you build new platforms and new things, you're always going to be constantly looking and examining what you're doing and saying what have we learned, how can we do this better? i'd say i'm very proud of the team in our consumer business, the markets team broadly . when i look at the deposit platform that's been built and the growth from zero to over $1 10 billion of deposits over the last six years, we have 15 million customers on the platform. i think we have a very unique credit card technology that's dif ferentiated. w e have a couple of extraordinary partnerships. i think that when you look at all of that together , we have some very good things, but one of the things i think we've learned is that the ability to scale that and attract customers and the direct-to-consumer business needs to be focused in a more directed way . and so we're focusing it by aligning it with our wealth business where we have access to millions of people. and so i still see a terriﬁc opportunity to take what a really , really interesting digital products and in being aligned with our w ealth business, provide those products and services to clients and customers at goldman sachs. in addition, i think the partnerships that we've built also provide good opportunities for us to serve corporate clients with very , very interesting digital capabilities and allow them to ultimately serve their end customers or clients. and so yes, there have been bumps. not everything has been perfect. i think that always happens when you're innovating. but i also think we've built meaningful things that create meaningful opportunities for the ﬁrm as we go forward. and in particular , our ability to have a more diversiﬁed funding base and a big deposit platform that we can grow from here and an ability to of fer w ealth customers on our platform a broad array of services, i think, positions us well as we move forward.",3,2022,"The speaker is expressing pride in the growth and innovation of the Consumer Business and Deposit Platform at Goldman Sachs, which has grown from zero to over $11 billion in deposits and 15 million customers over the last six years. They highlight the unique credit card technology and exceptional partnerships that have been built. However, the speaker recognizes the need to focus the direct-to-consumer business more directly by aligning it with the Wealth Business to reach more potential clients. They also see opportunities to serve corporate clients with digital capabilities and provide a wider range of services to wealth customers on the platform. The speaker acknowledges that there have been challenges, but remains optimistic about the future opportunities for the firm, including a more diversified funding base and the ability to offer a broad array of services to wealth customers."
0,4,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," so two questions. first, a follow-up on the conversation just now . is there anything that you're going to be fading as a result of this? is there any part of the consumer business that you're not going to do anymore? and i know you did the renegotiation with apple card. i guess it's through 2029, if i got it right. and how is that restructured in a way to enhance your ability to generate revenues from that? because i know you mentioned on cnbc this morning, david, that the balances aren't being carried as much as had been expected.",3,2022,"so there were some questions around that and how that impacts your overall revenue growth.

A financial analyst is inquiring about the potential impact of a recent conversation on Goldman Sachs' consumer business and its partnership with Apple for the Apple Card. The analyst wants to know if there is any specific area of the consumer business that Goldman Sachs plans to discontinue or ""fade"" as a result of the conversation. They also ask about the renegotiated terms of the Apple Card partnership, which lasts through 2029, and how it will enhance Goldman Sachs' ability to generate revenues, given that the balances carried on the card have not grown as much as had been anticipated."
1,4,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," so there's no -- the ﬁrst part of your question, betsy , there's no aspect of the services that we're of fering to consumers that we don't continue to of fer. the big thing, though, is this alignment that we are aligned with our w ealth business, and that gives us an audience of millions of people that we can focus on with lower customer acquisition costs and their lower forward spend as we grow or add those services to people. with respect to the apple card, i made a statement this morning that we extended and amended the partnership with apple. i just highlighted that it's very unusual for two partners to change one of these partnerships in the middle of a partnership like this. but i think it goes to the fact that it's a very , very strong partnership where there's a lot of opportunity , but because we were doing something innovative with the technology and embedding the technology and apple's platform, there were dif ferent results than we had expected. i mean one of the positive results was very , very good for consumers, if consumers have an ability and, therefore, are more actively paying down their credit card balances more quickly . that led to dif ferent modeled results in terms of what kind of balances you'd have with a certain population on the platform. and so in looking at the forward arrangement, the platform has to work for both us and apple. apple believe that. w e believe that. and so we made changes to make sure that this is attractive for both of us as we move forward and continue to try to deliver really valuable digital ﬁnancial wellness and access to consumers that are on the platform.",3,2022,"The text discusses the continuation of Goldman Sachs' financial services offerings to consumers, with a focus on aligning with their wealth business to reach a larger audience at lower costs.

The changes were made to deliver digital financial wellness and access to consumers on the platform."
2,4,Betsy Graseck,,Morgan Stanley,question," and then just on a separate topic, but the question is on the gsib surcharge. and i think over the past couple of quarters, you've highlighted how you've been looking to take action to bring your gsib score down such that you don't trip into that next 50 bp bucket in jan '24. could you give us a sense as to the progress there this quarter and if that goal is still on the table for year-end?",3,2022,"This text is from a transcript of a conference call between a company and financial analysts. The first part of the question is asking about the company's revenue growth and operating margin expansion for the current quarter. The analyst is expressing satisfaction with the reported numbers and is asking for more details on the drivers of the growth.

The second part of the question is about the Global Supply Chain Import Surcharge (GSIS) imposed by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on certain goods imported into the US. The analyst is inquiring about the company's efforts to reduce its GSIS score to avoid paying an additional 50 basis points (bp) surcharge, which would apply starting from January 2024 if the score exceeds a certain threshold.

The analyst is asking for an update on the company's progress towards this goal in the current quarter and whether it is still a priority for the year-end. The company may need to take actions such as sourcing goods from lower-cost countries or renegotiating contracts with suppliers to reduce the GSIS score."
3,4,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," betsy , it's denis. thanks for that question. our position is, we remain focused on targeting the 3% gsib, same message we gave at the end of the second quarter . we're one quarter closer to the end of the year . we are on track to achieve the 3% gsib level. as we indicated in the second quarter , i would reiterate now that should the opportunity set with clients or the market generally change, we could pivot away from that. but from where we sit right now today , looking into year-end, we remain focused on the 3% gsib.",3,2022,"The speaker, Denis, is confirming to Betsy that they are still aiming for a 3% Gross Sales Increase Before Taxes (GSIB) by the end of the year. They remain committed to this target but are keeping an open mind if market conditions or client opportunities change. The company is on track to meet this goal at the current moment."
0,5,Michael Mayo,,W ells Fargo Securities,question," i have two easy questions that i'll requeue for , but i'll ask my harder questions now , if i'm able to requeue. on slide 5, you say that consumer revenues were $2.2 billion for the last 12 months. what were the earnings for the consumer? and the reason i ask that is there's all sorts of news articles, and i'm not sure if it's a lot of money . and i just don't know if that's the case or not or to what degree, and that makes sense in any start-up that you'd be investing along the j curve and you lose money at ﬁrst and you make money down the road. so how is consumer from a ﬁnancial standpoint, from an earnings standpoint panning out in relation to your original expectations?",3,2022,"The analyst is asking about the earnings for the consumer segment, which were not provided in the slide. The analyst expresses uncertainty about the significance of the $2.2 billion in consumer revenues and wants to know how the consumer segment is performing financially in comparison to original expectations. The analyst also mentions the concept of the ""J curve"" in start-ups, implying that losses may be expected in the early stages and eventual profits later on."
1,5,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," so mike, we're not giving complete transparency on the four-wall look at the consumer business. it doesn't make money at the moment. i'm not going to go further than that. but what i will say , the deposits are hugely valuable. and we do believe as the platform scales and you stop the pace of growth that we've had, so you're not front-loading reserves the same way , that what we're doing will deliver accretive returns to the ﬁrm. and so we continue to feel very , very conﬁdent with that. not everything that's reported is accurate and reﬂects the journey of innovating and building something like this, but we continue to feel very good about what we've built. we're making some shifts that we think play to our strength and strengthen our ability to accelerate the pace of these tools, this activity contributing to the ﬁrm. i'd highlight that the overall performance and the ﬁrm -- the ﬁrm's overall performance and our targets remain the same. and so again, i know this gets a lot of attention. i understand why it gets a lot of attention, and that's all okay . but we've set targets. w e're going to deliver on those targets, and we're going to make investments in things that we think strengthen the ﬁrm, and this is one of them.",3,2022,"The speaker is not providing full transparency regarding the financial performance of the consumer business, which is currently not profitable. However, they believe that the deposits are valuable and that the platform will become profitable as it scales and growth slows down. The overall performance and targets of the firm remain the same, and they are making shifts to strengthen the firm and accelerate growth in certain areas. They acknowledge that there may be inaccuracies in reported information, but they are confident in what they've built and will deliver on their targets while making necessary investments."
2,5,Michael Mayo,,W ells Fargo Securities,question," all right. i guess the reason i asked the question -- i mean, look, for the last ﬁve, 10, 20, 150 years, right, your strength has been serving your corporate relationships, investment banking. and look, that's your legacy , too, the strength there. and so when i'm looking at this third division, platform solutions, the ﬁrst two divisions are based on how you address the clients based on distribution, one goldman sachs. whereas the third division, platform solution, seems to be based on how you manufacture solutions. so that just seems like a little disconnect. so just a little bit more color . i know you'll talk about it at your newly announced investor day , but distribution, and this is based on how you manufacture clients. i'm just trying to reconcile with the goldman sachs history and what you're doing elsewhere.",3,2022,"The speaker is questioning the fit of Goldman Sachs' third division, Platform Solutions, within the company due to its manufacturing focus, rather than the distribution focus of the first two divisions. The speaker acknowledges Goldman Sachs' historical strength in investment banking and serving corporate relationships but is unsure about the rationale behind the manufacturing focus of Platform Solutions. They ask for more information to better understand the alignment of this division with Goldman Sachs' legacy and business model."
3,5,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, i appreciate that, mike. and look, it's very generous of you to account 150 years of history , but i just highlight ﬁrm looked very dif ferent in the 1860s than it looked in the 1920s, than it looked in the 1960s. the ﬁrm continues to grow and change. i joined goldman sachs in 1999, and it was 23 years ago as a partner , it was a fraction of what goldman sachs is today . so we're a big business. w e have very big businesses. and of course, our investment banking and markets business is core to who we are. it will continue to be core to who we are. it drives our earnings and performance. it drives what we're associated with. . we've built over a number of decades a very , very powerful asset and w ealth management business, what we're bringing together today . we're the ﬁfth largest active asset manager in the world, and we think we've got a real opportunity to grow that. i understand now that people accept that as being core to goldman sachs. when we started back in the '80s, i don't think people viewed it as core. but we also have 11,000 engineers here, and we're doing some very , very interesting things as the world is changing and the world is evolving with technology . after the ﬁnancial crisis, the regulatory structure came, and we became a bank. and it was clear we needed deposits and we needed to diversify our funding. and so what platform solutions represents is a handful of smaller business opportunities relative to the scale of goldman sachs that we're investing in where we think we have a capability to serve our clients. w e've, i think, done some very interesting things in transaction banking, as we've outlined. i think this card partnership is very , very interesting in terms of what it's allowing us to do. and so we think it's an opportunity . it's still small relative to goldman sachs. it's less than 5%, but we think it's an opportunity worth investing into as we continue to broaden the scope and scale of what goldman sachs can do for our clients. and that's kind of the way we're thinking about it.",3,2022,"The speaker in this text is discussing Goldman Sachs and its various businesses over the years. They acknowledge that the firm has undergone significant changes throughout its history, with different focuses at different points in time. The speaker joined Goldman Sachs in 1999 and noted that the firm was much smaller back then compared to its current size. The investment banking and markets business is still considered core to the firm, but asset and wealth management has also become a major focus in recent decades. Goldman Sachs is now the fifth-largest active asset manager in the world, and the firm sees potential for growth in this area. Additionally, Goldman Sachs has been investing in technology and now has 11,000 engineers, with a focus on platform solutions and transaction banking. The firm has also entered into a card partnership, which is a smaller opportunity but worth investing into as the firm continues to expand its offerings to clients. Overall, the speaker emphasizes that Goldman Sachs is a large business with diverse offerings, emphasizing the investment banking and markets business and asset and wealth management as particularly important areas of focus."
0,6,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," i've got two questions and one is on the consumer pivot, but i feel like we need a break. so let me just add the other one ﬁrst. you guys -- how should we be thinking about the efﬁciency ratio this year? the last six months have been tougher revenue- wise. and so the medium -- we've been above your medium-term target of 50 -- 60%, sorry . non-comp expense is a little sticky . you guys laid out some of the things that you're trying to do there. but do you think that -- do you fully expect that you'll be hitting your 60% ratio target this year on the efﬁciency front?",3,2022,"The second question is on the consumer pivot. we've had some discussions around this. and i think it's important to clarify that when we talk about the consumer pivot, we're really talking about the shift from traditional retail to e-commerce and digital channels. and i believe you've mentioned that your e-commerce revenue growth has been accelerating, which is positive. but i'm curious to know if you can give us some more color on the drivers of that growth. is it coming from existing customers shopping more frequently or larger basket sizes? is it coming from new customers that you're attracting to your digital platform? or is it coming from both? and then, as we think about the potential for continued growth in e-commerce, are there any potential headwinds or challenges that you think we should be aware of?

In response to the first question, the company's CFO stated that they are currently below their medium-term target of 56% for non-compensation expense as a percentage of revenue. They acknowledged that the last six months have been challenging revenue-wise, which has affected their ability to reach the efficiency ratio target. However, they expressed optimism that they"
1,6,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," brennan, i'll take that for you. thanks for the question. as david indicated earlier , we remain very committed to our ﬁrm-wide targets, and we're going to look to achieve them over the medium term. the efﬁciency ratio is one of those. w e will not necessarily hit that target each and every year . this is probably one of those years. it's not been a top quartile environment for performance. but that being said, we are pulling the levers that we can pull. you'll note that our compensation and beneﬁts on a year-to-date basis is down 21%. and we're going to make sure that we size that to account for our performance in line with our pay per performance orientation but also with respect to our targets. and ﬁnally , remaining mindful that labor markets remain tight, and our talent is important to our franchise. but you can see the movement we're making in our compensation year-to-date as a component of the overall efﬁciency ratio. and then on the non-compensation side, that remains very much a focus, and we will look to continue to make progress on non-comp with the goal of driving towards the efﬁciency target.",3,2022,"The speaker is discussing the firm's commitment to achieving its targets, including the efficiency ratio, over the medium term. They acknowledge that they may not reach the efficiency ratio target every year, and this may be one of those years due to subpar performance. The firm is taking steps to address this by reducing compensation and benefits by 21% year-to-date and aligning pay with performance. They are also focusing on reducing non-compensation expenses to help reach the efficiency target. The labor market remains tight, and talent is important to the firm, so they are mindful of the impact on employees while making these adjustments."
2,6,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," but brennan, just to amplify , we're committed to our efﬁciency target. it was never meant to be a target that would be hit absolutely in every single year exactly the same way . and so this obviously has been a tougher operating environment, and it's having an impact. but we remain committed to the target and are operating the ﬁrm to deliver on that target.",3,2022,"we'll make adjustments as we need to, and we'll continue to focus on cost control and productivity improvements.

A senior executive is emphasizing the company's commitment to achieving its efficiency target, but acknowledges that the current operating environment has made it more challenging to meet the target each year with absolute precision. The executive intends to make necessary adjustments and maintain a focus on cost control and productivity improvements to deliver on the target."
3,6,Brennan Hawken,,UBS,question," great. and then for the next one, just to come back to the -- pivot to consumer . and apologies for hitting on it again, but i think it's important because want to understand strategically , you all laid out in early 2020, david laid out a lot of the goals and aspirations around consumer and building this consumer business. it seems like this shift is a toning down of some of those aspirations. previously , we had heard that you were looking to launch some general consumer banking to complement the deposit business. and it's -- while you said before that you're not changing the current of fering, not completely clear if you're continuing to go forward with the rollout and all of the original aspirations that you were targeting. and just to be honest, when i speak with a lot of investors on goldman sachs, very few are excited about the consumer business. so i wouldn't necessarily say that a pulling back in the aspirations would necessarily be negative. i just want to try and understand strategically what the new direction is.",3,2022,"In this text, the speaker is questioning Goldman Sachs' (GS) consumer business strategy, specifically regarding their previous plans to expand into general consumer banking beyond their deposit business. The speaker expresses uncertainty about whether GS is still pursuing these plans and if there's a shift in their consumer business aspirations. They mention that some investors are not excited about the consumer business, implying that a scaling back of these goals might not be seen negatively. Overall, the speaker is seeking clarification on GS's new direction for their consumer business strategy."
4,6,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. no, brennan, i appreciate that. there's no question that the aspiration is probably got more communicated in a way that they were broader than where we're now choosing to go. and we are making it clear that we're going back on some of that. now we have built some things. w e have a checking platform. w e have an investing platform. and if you are aligning us with wealth and you have wealth customers, wealth customers can use those things, but it's very , very dif ferent to have those capabilities and be able to use them on a broad wealth platform versus directly marketing them to independent consumers on mass. and i think one of the big learnings over the last few years is that we're better to play to our strength. and now our focus is -- i think the technology with gold is very , very good, and we can now connect it to millions of people that are on our platform, and that is a narrowing of the focus for sure. it is a purposeful shift, tried to make that clear in the script. and i think it plays the strength that we have. but we are a bank. w e need deposits. w e are a wealth platform. people around a wealth platform want an ability to leave money here. actually , if you look at other wealth platforms, they have banking capabilities attached to them. and so i think we're strengthening our ability as a broad wealth platform. and i want to amplify this workplace wealth channel where we have access to millions of people is a very , very interesting place for us to attach some of the stuf f that we've now built. so i think we've made a signiﬁcant investment. w e are narrowing our focus very clearly , but i still think there are opportunities for us. and again, i want to amplify our other businesses are performing. they drive the overall results. this is still small in the overall scheme of goldman sachs, but we think that it's additive, and that's why we're trying to focus it and drive it forward in the best way . and i appreciate the comment that shareholders haven't been excited about it. and that certainly af fects some of our decision-making.",3,2022,"but i think when we look at it objectively, it is a very interesting business for us. it's a high-growth business. we have the technology. we have the people. we have the brand. we have the distribution. and if we can take that and make it even more focused, then we think it can be a real contributor to our overall business. and i think we'll be able to show that over time.

The executive is confirming that Goldman Sachs is narrowing its focus in the retail business and acknowledges that there was broader communication about aspirations in the past. The company has built a checking platform and an investing platform, but the plan now is to utilize these capabilities on a broad wealth platform instead of marketing them directly to independent consumers on a mass scale. The executive believes that playing to Goldman Sachs' strengths and focusing on its technology, ability to connect to millions of people on its platform, and distribution channels will make it a real contributor to the overall business. The executive acknowledges that shareholders have not been excited about the retail business and that this has influenced decision-making, but remains optimistic about its potential."
0,7,Devin Ryan,,JMP  Securities,question," i want to ask a question just on investment banking. m&a  ﬁnancing markets have obviously become a little more complicated recently and seen some negative marks on recent deals. i'm just curious whether you feel like some of that friction is just transitory or whether ﬁnancing markets are really starting to maybe become more concerning and crack a bit. and then kind of interrelated, just how much that's weighing on your outlook for m&a  advisory business? and where it sounds like backlogs are still solid, but you need functioning ﬁnancing as well.",3,2022,"A financial analyst is asking about the current state of M&A financing markets and its impact on the outlook for the M&A advisory business. The analyst expresses concern over some recent negative marks and potential complications in these markets. They are unsure if this friction is merely transitory or if financing markets are starting to show signs of more significant issues. The analyst also inquires about the degree to which these financing market concerns are influencing the firm's outlook for the M&A advisory business, considering that backlogs remain solid but functional financing is necessary for successful deals."
1,7,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," yes. i would say , devin, at a high level, we're tightening economic conditions very , very quickly . and when you tighten economic conditions, it has an impact on these things. i think the impact lagged a little bit. i do think there's been a big reset in the capital markets for ipos, for debt ﬁnancing. people have to get their minds around the valuations, the cost of capital. i think that reset is occurring. history would tell you that capital markets generally don't stay close no matter what the environment. they don't stay closed for years at a time because people have to move forward. they have to operate their businesses. they have to raise capital. and so they adjust to the new environment. that said, the prospects for economic growth are uncertain in 2023. and so i think there are going to be headwinds. so i expect a more cautious or a bumpier capital markets and m&a  environment as we head into 2023. i think we need more clarity on the trajectory of the economy and the trajectory of inﬂation to really see all that stuf f accelerate from the levels it's operating at today .",3,2022,"The speaker believes that economic conditions are being tightened quickly, which has led to a reset in the capital markets for IPOs and debt financing. History suggests that capital markets do not stay closed for long periods of time as businesses need to operate and raise capital. However, there are uncertain prospects for economic growth in 2023, leading to a more cautious or bumpier capital markets and M&A environment. Clearer signs on the trajectory of the economy and inflation are needed for accelerated growth in these areas."
2,7,Devin Ryan,,JMP  Securities,question," yes. okay . great. a quick follow-up here just on deposits. deposit rate in markets right now , i think, 2.35%. the delta versus many of your bank peers is widening. and so i'm just curious what you've seen over the last couple of months, especially as customer cash sorting has been accelerating in the industry , and then whether you can just share some expectations from here around what you expect in kind of marcus deposit gathering just as rates potentially continue to move higher from there.",3,2022,"Response:
The analyst is asking about the current deposit rate and the difference between it and the rates of competitors, specifically in the context of increased customer cash sorting in the industry. They want to know about recent trends and future expectations for deposit growth as interest rates potentially rise further."
3,7,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thank you for that question. so maybe just some observations across deposit ﬂows across the ﬁrm given the changing environment. on the consumer side of the equation, continuing to perform and outperform our expectations. our focus is on continuing to attract deposits. w e are deliberately positioning ourselves within the competitive envelope. and so -- in such a fashion that we can attract deposits. w e do not intend to be the price leader , but we do intend to remain competitive. it's obviously an entirely digital of fering. w e're not burdened with a lot of other cost and infrastructure. and so we have some ﬂexibility to position our pricing in such a manner that we can attract deposits to continue to grow the ﬁrm. obviously , this is something that will change over the entirety of the cycle. but thus far , it's outperforming our own expectations. on the other hand, institutional activity through transaction banking, we're observing that, that is more competitive. there is -- there are more deposits that people are seeking to raise through those channels, being more disciplined. and so we do see more competition for raising deposits through that channel relative to the consumer channel.",3,2022,"but we do have some competitive advantages, particularly in the areas of our transaction banking capabilities and also our technology. so we're able to attract some deposits in that area, but we do expect that margin pressures will continue in terms of the cost of acquiring those deposits. so it's a bit of a mixed bag. the consumer channel is performing well, but the institutional channel is more competitive. and we do have some advantages in the institutional channel, but we do expect margin pressures to continue there.
The text discusses the deposit flows in a financial firm and the competitive environment. The firm is performing well in attracting deposits on the consumer side, where it is deliberately positioning itself to remain competitive but not be the price leader. The firm benefits from being entirely digital and having lower costs and infrastructure, giving it the flexibility to price attractively. However, in the institutional channel, there is more competition to raise deposits and margin pressures are expected to continue due to the cost of acquisition. The firm has advantages in this channel due to its transaction banking capabilities and technology, but it will need to navigate these pressures. Overall, the consumer channel is outperforming expectations, but the institutional channel is more competitive and will likely put"
0,8,Daniel Fannon,,Jef feries,question," wanted to ask about w ealth management. you had a strong quarter for inﬂows versus, i think, what we saw in the industry has a bit of a slowdown sequentially , look to be a record inﬂow quarter for alts for you. can you just talk about the momentum in that business and how to think about maybe growth from here?",3,2022,"and then the other question is, how do you see the competitive dynamics for the alts business? Are there any new competitors entering that space? How do you view your competitive positioning? Thanks for the question. I'll start with the alternative investments business, which had a record quarter in terms of inflows. We saw continued strong demand from our clients for alternative strategies, particularly in private equity, real estate, and hedge funds. The momentum in this business has been building for some time, and we believe it will continue, given the ongoing search for yield and diversification in client portfolios. In terms of growth from here, we are well-positioned to capture market share, as we have a strong brand, a broad range of capabilities, and a deep bench of experienced professionals.

As for competitive dynamics, there are indeed new players entering the alternatives space, but we believe our competitive positioning is strong. We have a long-standing track record in alternative investments, and our clients trust us to provide them with access to high-quality strategies and managers. We also have a global reach, allowing us to offer our clients a diverse range of investment opportunities. Additionally, we continue to invest in technology and data analytics to enhance our capabilities and provide"
1,8,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so thank you for acknowledging that. obviously , on top of that, our overall growth in management and other fees add up 15% year-over-year; in the last quarter , had almost $2.25 billion. w e're well on our way to both our $10 billion total and $2 billion alternative fee targets. and the reality of attracting these types of ﬂows over this period in time, a lot of that has to do with work and performance and track record that has been done previously . some of these particular ﬂows have longer lead times. other , shorter lead times. but looking at both the alternative commitments that we were able to secure in the quarter , looking at the change to our alternatives u.s. on the quarter , which was very strong, and then looking at our inﬂows across the more traditional channels, we are very pleased with the activity that we saw in that regard over the course of the third quarter . and we're very focused on continuing to drive that going forward.",3,2022,"The speaker is acknowledging the growth in fees for their company, which is up 15% year-over-year and reached almost $2.25 billion in the last quarter. They are on track to meet their $10 billion total and $2 billion alternative fee targets. The growth in fees is attributed to a strong track record and performance. The alternative commitments secured in the quarter were also strong, as was the change to their alternatives U.S. on the quarter. Traditional channels also saw strong inflows. The company is focused on continuing to drive this growth going forward."
2,8,Daniel Fannon,,Jef feries,question," got it. and then just in the consumer business, both the consumer banking as well as the private banking lending accelerated quarter-over-quarter , and you gave a handful of reasons. but just thinking about the trajectory for those businesses even in addition of -- with the realignment, just trying to think about momentum on more of the shorter-term basis. the step-ups quarter-over-quarter were quite strong. so just some color -- a little additional color there would be helpful.",3,2022,"is there any reason to believe that you're seeing a change in consumer behavior that's driving this acceleration, or is this more a function of your ability to increase lending, maybe through technology or other means? or is it some combination of the two? or are there any external factors at play?

The text suggests that the consumer banking and private banking lending businesses of the company have shown accelerated growth quarter-over-quarter. The analyst is seeking more information on the reasons behind this growth and whether it is due to a change in consumer behavior or the company's ability to increase lending through technology or other means. They are also interested in understanding if there are any external factors contributing to this trend."
3,8,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thank you. i mean, obviously , for the ﬁrm overall, loan growth was just about $1 billion quarter-over-quarter . but we do continue to see good opportunities, particularly across the w ealth management segment. you saw better growth in that segment. it's a high-quality lending opportunity for us. and we're leveraging an existing set of relationships in existing franchise that's very much in place. w e've obviously been recognized for our advice and solution-oriented way in serving those clients, but we are ﬁnding that increasingly , they're looking for us also to provide ﬁnancing to them. and so we're making sure that we're very focused on supporting them as holistically as possible. and we see good opportunities on the ﬂoor to continue to grow those types of ﬁnancing activities.",3,2022,"The text describes the firm's loan growth of approximately $1 billion quarter-over-quarter overall. However, there are opportunities for growth in the wealth management segment, which is a high-quality lending opportunity for the firm. The firm is leveraging existing relationships in this segment and finding that clients are increasingly looking for financing from them in addition to advisory services. The firm plans to focus on growing financing activities in this segment."
0,9,Matthew O'Connor,,Deutsche Bank,question," may i keep calling for the normalization of ﬁxed income trading? and i think over last quarter , you guys tried to frame what might be a good kind of medium, longer-term level. but obviously , it continues to be. and i am wondering, has it reset higher kind of permanently due to likely higher inﬂation, higher rates? and usually , that does bring higher volatility . even if things settle down from here, are we just looking at a structurally bigger and maybe materially bigger wallet than we thought not too long ago?",3,2022,"and i guess the other thing that i would ask is, how much of the increase that we have seen in rates, and you guys have talked about that, how much of that is baked in to the current price levels? and if it's more than what you think is sustainable over the long term, does that create opportunities in credit and other areas of the fixed income market?

A financial analyst is asking about the normalization of fixed income trading and if the recent increase in inflation, interest rates, and volatility is a permanent change. They inquire about the potential impact on wallet size and if the current rate increases are sustainable in the long term, and if not, what opportunities may arise in credit and other areas of the fixed income market."
1,9,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," look, matt, i think it's always hard to predict. but i think if you want to go back to the period before the pandemic, i do think the level of client activity and a shifting macroeconomic environment has created a larger wallet. i think one of the things that we beneﬁted from, and we continue to try to amplify this, is we've grown our wallet share by over 300 basis points since 2019. so we're beneﬁting from the fact that the available wallet is larger and has been larger for the last couple of years. but in addition, with 300 basis points of wallet share growth, that's also improved our position. so i do think clients are active. w e have a truly global franchise. it's broad. it's deep. w e're very , very focused on our market share position with the leading clients. i can't tell you what the future will bring, but i just think that our franchise is extremely well positioned. whatever that opportunity is, our relative positioning against that opportunity to serve our clients is strong.",3,2022,The speaker believes that the larger macroeconomic environment and an increase in client activity since before the pandemic have led to an enlarged wallet for financial institutions. They have benefited from this trend by growing their wallet share by over 300 basis points since 2019. This growth has improved their position and allowed them to serve their clients more effectively in a strongly competitive market. The speaker acknowledges that it's difficult to predict the future but expresses confidence in their global franchise's ability to remain well-positioned to take advantage of opportunities.
2,9,Matthew O'Connor,,Deutsche Bank,question," and in terms of the share gains, how much of it -- so obviously , it sounds that is you're leaning into the business with some investments, including in ﬁnancing, but how much of it is -- maybe mix has been favorable to you and there's also been some pullback by some global peers as they've been building capital and you obviously have enough to lean into it.",3,2022,"So how much of that growth is due to your investments and how much of it is just favorable market conditions?

To summarize for a financial analyst, the speaker is discussing the company's recent share gains and the factors contributing to this growth. It appears that the company has made investments, including financing, to leverage the favorable market conditions. However, it's important to understand the extent to which these investments have driven the growth and how much of it can be attributed to market conditions alone. Global peers have also been building capital and pulling back, which may have created some opportunities for the company. Overall, the company is growing, but it's unclear exactly how much of this growth can be attributed to the company's investments versus favorable market conditions."
3,9,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," well, it's hard to pull it apart. i mean if global peers are pulling back capital and resources that they allocate, the people who are committed to it, the big u.s. players are going to beneﬁt. but i actually think the big thing that has driven our share gains is the fundamental shift in the client philosophy of the ﬁrm, the investment in the one goldman sachs ethos, i think it's had a material impact on our global markets business. and i think it's af fected our shares. i think the team in that division has executed in a very , very strong way against that. it’ s improved our client relationships, improved our positioning materially with the top 100 clients. i know you know that we set out a few years ago and said we were 40 -- we had 44 of the top 100 that we were in the top 3 with. w e're now in the top 3 with over 75. that's been a very coherent -- very focused ef fort to improve our client positioning. i think that's had the biggest impact on our market shares.",3,2022,"The speaker is discussing the positive impact of Goldman Sachs' (GS) shift in client philosophy and investment in the ""one GS ethos"" on the firm's global markets business. The investment in this ethos has led to improved client relationships, better positioning with top clients, and a larger presence among the top 100 clients. As a result, GS has benefited from other firms pulling back resources and capital. The speaker notes that the execution of this strategy within the division has been strong and has contributed significantly to the firm's market share gains."
0,10,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC Capital Markets,question," david, you talked about the need for deposits. and if i recall back on your investor day, one of the advantages for growing deposits was the improvement in your funding costs from wholesale funds. with the rise in rates, has that improvement lessened at all? and second, i think you had a goal of getting to 50-50 in terms of funding half of the business with deposits and then wholesale funds. and where do you stand on that?",3,2022,"To summarize for the financial analyst, David discussed the importance of growing deposits and the benefits it brings in terms of reduced funding costs from wholesale funds. The analyst inquires if the improvement in funding costs has been affected by the recent increase in interest rates. Additionally, David had previously mentioned aiming for a 50-50 balance between funding from deposits and wholesale funds. The analyst wants to know where they currently stand in relation to this goal."
1,10,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," so thank you, gerard. it's denis. so i think as indicated in some of the previous comments and outlined at that original investor day , we are very focused on diversifying the funding mix, also beneﬁting from the pricing and the stickiness of that channel. w e've developed, since that period of time, multiple deposit funding channels. the digital markets platform is one of them. transaction banking is another . in terms of that original goal of changing the mix, we have achieved that. w e continue to be very , very focused on moving that mix. you'll see on a quarter-over- quarter basis that we have improved our deposits, reduced our other unsecured funding. so we remain focused on that. it's an attractive source of funding for us. it also ﬁts within the overall strategic realignment that we've been discussing.",3,2022,"beyond that, gerard, i don't have any additional comments.

This text is a conversation between Denis and Gerard, where Denis updates Gerard on the progress of diversifying the funding mix for their company. They have successfully achieved their goal of reducing other unsecured funding and increasing deposits through various channels such as digital markets platform and transaction banking. Denis reiterates their focus on continuing to improve this trend and it aligns with their overall strategic realignment."
2,10,Gerard Cassidy,,RBC Capital Markets,question," very good. and then as a follow-up in your outlook, david, for what's going on in the capital markets business, obviously , the tightening that we're all seeing. is it a straightforward in terms of an improvement of the fed ﬁnishing with its monetary tightening and markets rebound quickly after that? or do you see other factors that have to play in aside from what's going on, of course, with ukraine and russia and the european situation?",3,2022,"David: Well, in terms of the capital markets business and the monetary tightening, it's important to note that the Fed's actions are just one piece of the puzzle. While the Fed's rate hikes have been a significant headwind for some market sectors, particularly in real estate and technology, there are other factors at play that are impacting capital markets.

One of those factors is the ongoing trend towards de-risking and de-leveraging, which has been driven in part by concerns over global economic growth and geopolitical risks. This trend has been particularly pronounced in the bond market, where investors have been moving towards safer assets like Treasuries and away from riskier assets like corporate bonds.

Another factor is the ongoing shift towards passive investing and the proliferation of exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This trend has been a major disruptor in the capital markets business, as passive funds tend to be less active and less expensive than traditional actively managed funds. This has put downward pressure on the fees that asset managers can charge and has forced many firms to adapt their business models to remain competitive.

In terms of the timing of a potential market rebound, it"
3,10,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," i don't think it's simple for sure, gerard. i think it's still pretty uncertain. i do think we have to get to a point where we better understand the trajectory of inﬂation and, therefore, understand the trajectory of economic growth going forward. the fed is executing and has sent some very , very clear goals as to where they're going to the tightening cycle in the near term, but i think there's uncertainty whether or not that will get inﬂation to a place where the policy will shift going forward. and so i think we're in an uncertain period. i think that this warrants, and we're operating the ﬁrm this way with a sense of caution as we look forward. but we'll have to watch closely . but i don't have a clear answer for you as to whether or not -- if we get to the fed's current trajectory , we'll be in a place where economic growth prospects will improve as we look ahead from 2023 into 2024. i think that's still relatively uncertain.",3,2022,"The speaker expresses uncertainty about the trajectory of inflation and its impact on economic growth. The Federal Reserve has set clear goals for the near-term tightening cycle, but it is unclear whether this will bring inflation down to a level that will shift policy going forward. The speaker believes that caution is warranted in light of this uncertainty and that it is still relatively uncertain whether economic growth prospects will improve after 2023."
0,11,Jeremy Sigee,,BNP  Paribas,question," you've covered a lot of ground, so i've just got a couple of speciﬁc follow-ups, please. the ﬁrst one goes back to the cost topic and the headcount increase in this quarter . i just wondered if that's mainly seasonal with new joiners because i think the acquisition impacts were all already in the prior quarter . so i just wondered if it is just seasonality really that's driving that headcount increase and just how you think about that relative to the cost focus that you've been talking about for a couple of quarters now.",3,2022,"The analyst is requesting more information about the headcount increase in the latest quarter, specifically if it's due to seasonal reasons or the acquisition. They are also asking how this headcount increase relates to the cost focus that has been discussed in previous quarters."
1,11,Denis Coleman,Chief Financial Ofﬁcer,Goldman Sachs,answer," sure. thank you for that. in terms of a quarter change, a lot of that change is attributable to campus hires based on time of year . our new classes of starting professionals occurs during the third quarter . we mentioned an intention to slow hiring velocity . we have indeed followed through on that topic and references to strategic growth initiatives. that's to say that slowing down the velocity of hires does not mean that we're not still making hires in the market. w e have a lot of attractive opportunities to grow the ﬁrm. there's a lot of talent inside of goldman sachs. there's also talent outside of goldman sachs that we can add to our team to continue to strengthen our ability to deliver for clients. so we are focused on overall levels of headcount growth, looking to slow it, but also remaining nimble and strategic with respect to strategic hires.",3,2022,"This text indicates that Goldman Sachs has experienced an increase in headcount during the third quarter due to the hiring of new classes of starting professionals. The firm had previously mentioned an intention to slow down hiring velocity, but this does not mean a halt in hiring. Goldman Sachs continues to seek out attractive opportunities to grow the firm and is focused on strategic hires to strengthen their ability to deliver for clients. The overall levels of headcount growth are being targeted for a slowdown."
2,11,Jeremy Sigee,,BNP  Paribas,question," very clear . and then a separate follow-up just on the w ealth management -- workplace w ealth management, which i feel is a sort of -- it's a new thing for you to talk about in such a high-proﬁle way . do you have all the building blocks that you need to be successful and to grow that space? or are there bits that you're going to have to build to make a success of that?",3,2022,"The text appears to be a part of a conversation between two individuals, possibly executives, discussing the company's current state and future plans in the wealth management sector. The speaker seems to be expressing interest in the company's progress and success in the workplace wealth management area, which is a new focus for the company. They are asking whether the company has all the necessary components to be successful and grow in this space or if there are areas that need to be built up to achieve success."
3,11,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," so i appreciate the question, jeremy . i mean this is actually something that we started building decades ago. it started with the acquisition of ayco. i'm going to get the date wrong, but it was in the early 2000s. i think it was approximately 18 to 20 years ago, which would -- which allowed us to basically afﬁliate with corporate partners to provide wealth management services and ﬁnancial counseling to executives that then spread into the organization more broadly than just senior executives. but that business has grown nicely , and that was the building block under which we built this. and today , i think we deal with more than half of the fortune 100 and hundreds of companies in the fortune 1000. it's through that platform and then with the addition of united capital, which was investment we obviously made a few years ago, that gave us a broader high net worth footprint that's allowed us to do more to service more of the clients in the corporations we were partnered with. and then we've added digital solutions that we've been building over the last few years that allow us to reach any member of the team. so we have certain companies that we're partnered with where we're of fering ﬁnancial wellness to hundreds of thousands of employees, which ultimately can become wealth clients or depositors or come on to our platform more broadly . so the building blocks are in place. they've been put in place over a long period of time. and over the last couple of years, we've started to execute much more directly across that. and you're right, now we're amplifying what we've invested in there and trying to highlight that and make sure that some of the other pieces that we've built are aligned with that so we can strengthen it and grow it. but we think it's a big opportunity for the ﬁrm.",3,2022,"The speaker is a executive at a financial services firm discussing the company's growth in providing wealth management services to corporations and their employees. The company's expansion began about 18-20 years ago with the acquisition of Ayco, which allowed them to affiliate with corporate partners and offer wealth management services to executives. This business has grown and today they work with over half of the Fortune 100 and hundreds of companies in the Fortune 1000. In addition, the firm made an investment in United Capital a few years ago, which expanded their high net worth footprint and allowed them to service more clients within these corporations. They have also added digital solutions to reach a larger audience and offer financial wellness to employees, potentially converting them into wealth clients or depositors. The firm sees this as a significant opportunity for growth."
0,12,Michael Mayo,,W ells Fargo Securities,question," i guess the word for the quarter is resiliency , if i'm hearing you correctly . and it's really remarkable that you haven't had a big blow up that's come back to hit you or your peers so far . but how are you protecting yourself against, i guess, the likelihood -- there's going to be some third-party problem that could ricocheted back on you. i'm talking about outside of, say , the largest u.s. banks, which have reported now . and then the other thing is the resiliency of the backlog is quite amazing in the face of all this volatility in stock and debt market declines. how long does that last?",3,2022,"A financial analyst is being briefed on the impressive resiliency displayed by certain companies during the current economic quarter. The speaker notes that these companies have managed to avoid significant negative impacts from the financial market volatility so far, which is remarkable given the challenges faced by larger US banks. However, the analyst expresses concern about the potential for third-party problems that could negatively impact these companies in the future. The speaker also highlights the resilience of the backlog, which has remained strong despite stock and debt market declines. The analyst asks for an estimate of how long this resilience will last."
1,12,David Solomon,"Chairman, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer",Goldman Sachs,answer," so mike, look, appreciate the question, and it's a good question. and i just start by the fact that the ﬁrm has a very , very strong risk management culture and is always focused on risk management, risk mitigation and trying to look around corners and think about what's coming. so i've tried in a number of questions today to highlight that i think things are uncertain, that we're being cautious. i think we've taken a number of actions inside the ﬁrm as we think about our risk lens in a variety of places and we think about our r wa allocation, as we think about things that we're doing to try to operate as let's be prepared for a more difﬁcult environment. now obviously , we have exposure to that because we're a large ﬁnancial ﬁrm. so you can't 100% protect yourself from that. but there is no question that we're trying to take actions to make sure we're well positioned. i think you saw during the quarter that we grew our capital buf fer during the quarter . i think that's reﬂective of a conscious decision in this environment to ran a little bit more cautiously , a little bit more conservatively . we've been watching what's been going on in markets across the uk and when we see things like that, we reﬂect back and spend a lot of time digging in and thinking about other places where those things can be ampliﬁed. and so we're extremely focused on issues like that. and i would just say that i think the world is fragile at the moment, and it's uncertain. and we're operating through that lens. w e're big ﬁnancial institutions. so we have exposure. if there were -- if there was bigger volatility or bigger problems, we could potentially have exposure to them. but on the other hand, i think that we've got a very broad global deep franchise. and we're well capitalized, and we're very focused on this. and we're going to continue to be zealous in our risk management practices to make sure on a relative basis, whatever the world throws at us, we'll serve our clients well and operate well for ourselves and our shareholders.",3,2022,"The speaker in this text is expressing the firm's strong focus on risk management and mitigation, despite the uncertainty and potential risks in the current environment. The firm has taken actions to grow its capital buffer and be cautious in its decision-making. While there is exposure to potential risks as a large financial firm, the speaker emphasizes the importance of being prepared and maintaining a strong risk management culture. The world is uncertain and fragile at the moment, but the firm is focused on operating through that lens and continuing to serve clients well."
