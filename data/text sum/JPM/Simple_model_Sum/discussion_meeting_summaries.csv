2022_Q1,"Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.
Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $8.3 billion, EPS of $2.63, on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 16%.
These results include approximately $900 million of credit reserve builds, which I'll cover in more detail shortly, as well a s $500 million of
losses in credit adjustmen ts and other in CIB.
Regarding loan growth, we're continuing to see positive trends with loans up 8% year -on-year and 1% quarter -on-quarter ex PPP with the
sequential growth driven by continued pick -up in demand in our wholesale businesses, including ongo ing strength in AWM.
On page 2, we have some more detail on our results. Revenue of $31.6 billion was down $1.5 billion or 5% year on year. NII ex  Markets was
up $1 billion or 9% on balance sheet growth and higher rates, partially offset by lower NII from  PPP loans. NIR ex Markets was down $2.2
billion or 17% predominantly driven by lower IB fees, lower home lending production revenue, losses in credit adjustments and  other in CIB as
well as investment securities losses in corporate. And markets revenue wa s down $300 million or 3% against a record first quarter last year.
Expenses of $19.2 billion were up approximately $500 million or 2%, predominantly on higher investments and structural expens es, largely
offset by lower volume and revenue related expense s. Credit costs were $1.5 billion for the quarter. We built $902 million in reserves driven by
increasing the probability of downside risks due to high inflation and the war in Ukraine, as well as builds for Russia -associated exposures in
CIB and AWM. Net charge -offs of $582 million were down year -on-year and comparable to last quarter and remain historically low across our
portfolios.
On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. Our CET1 ratio ended at 11.9%, down 120 basis points from the prior quarter. As  a reminder, we
exited the fourth quarter with an elevated buffer to absorb anticipated changes this quarter, the largest being SA -CCR adoption as well as
some pick -up in seasonal activity. In addition to those anticipated items, there were a couple of oth er drivers. The rate selloff led to AOCI
drawdowns in our AFS portfolio, but keep in mind, all else equal, these mark -to-market losses accrete back to capital through time and as
securities mature.
And price increases across commodities resulted in higher  counterparty credit and market risk RWA. While, of course, the environment is
uncertain, many of these effects are now in the rearview mirror. And as a result, we believe that our current capital and fut ure earnings profile
position us well to continue su pporting business growth, while meeting increasing capital requirements as we look ahead.
With that, let's go to our businesses, starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page 4. CCB reported net income of $2.9 billion on
revenue of $12.2 billion, whi ch was down 2% year -on-year. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 8%, predominantly driven by
growth in deposit balances and client investment assets, partially offset by deposit margin compression. Deposits were up 18%  year-on-year
and 4% quarte r-on-quarter, consistent with last quarter. And client investment assets were up 9% year -on-year, largely driven by flows in
addition to market performance.
In Home Lending, revenue was down 20% year -on-year, on lower production revenue from both lower ma rgins and volumes against a very
strong quarter last year, largely offset by higher net servicing revenue. Originations of $24.7 billion declined 37% with the  rise in rates, and as
a result, mortgage loans were down 3%.
Moving to Card & Auto, revenue was down 8% year -on-year, primarily on strong new card account originations leading to higher acquisition
costs. Card outstandings were up 11%, and revolving balances have continued to grow, ending the quarter above the first quart er of 2021
levels. And in Aut o, originations were $8.4 billion, down 25% due to the lack of vehicle supply, while loans were up 3%.
Touching on consumer spend, combined credit and debit spend was up 21% year -on-year, with growth stronger in Credit as we see a
continued pickup in trav el and dining. And as the quarter progressed, we saw a robust reacceleration of T&E spend, up 64%. Expenses of
$7.7 billion were up 7% year -on-year, driven by higher investments and structural expenses, partially offset by lower volume - and revenue -
related  expenses.
Next, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.5 billion for the first quarter. Investmen t Banking revenue
of $2.1 billion was down 28% versus the prior year. IB fees were down 31% year -on-year. We maintained  our number one rank with a wallet
share of 8%. In advisory, fees were up 18%, and it was the best first quarter ever, benefiting from the closing of deals anno unced in 2021.
Debt underwriting fees were down 20%, primarily driven by leveraged finance as i ssuers contended with market volatility. And in equity
underwriting, fees were down 76% on lower issuance activity, particularly in North America and EMEA.
Moving to Markets, total revenue was $8.8 billion, down 3% against a record first quarter last year. Fixed income was relatively flat, driven by a
decline in securitized products, where rising rates have slowed down the pace of mortgage production, largely offset by growt h in currencies
and emerging markets and commodities on elevated client activit y in a volatile market. Equity Markets were down 7% against an all -time
record quarter last year. This quarter, however, was our second best, with robust client activity across both derivatives and  cash. And Prime
continued to perform well, with client bal ances hovering around all -time highs.
Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $524 million, driven by funding spread widening as well as credit valuation adjustme nts relating to
both increases in commodities exposures and markdowns of derivatives receiva bles from Russia -associated counter parties.
Let me take a second here to address the widely reported situation in the nickel market as it relates to our results this qua rter. We were
hedging positions for clients closely linked to nickel producers, who g enerally sell forward a portion of the coming year's production. The
extreme price movements created margin calls, which we and other banks are helping to address. Because this is counterparty r elated, not
trading, it appears in the Credit Adjustments & Ot her line, where it contributed about $120 million to the reported loss I just mentioned. It also
drove approximately half of the increase in market risk RWA that I noted on the capital slide, and was a driver of higher rep orted VaR, which
will also be elev ated in our upcoming filings.
Payments revenue was $1.9 billion, up 33% year -on-year, or up 9% excluding net gains on equity investments driven by continued growth in
fees, deposit balances and higher rates.
Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion wa s up 2% year -on-year driven by higher rates and growth in fees. Expenses of $7.3 billion were up
3% year -on-year mostly due to higher structural expenses and investments largely offset by lower volume - and revenue -related expenses.
Moving to Commercial Ba nking on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $850 million, and an ROE of 13%. Revenue of $2.4
billion was flat year -on-year with higher payments revenue and deposit balances offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross
Investment Banking  revenue of $729 million was down 35%, driven by both fewer large deals and less flow activity.
Expenses of $1.1 billion were up 17% year -on-year largely driven by investments and volume - and revenue -related expenses. Deposits were
down 2% quarter -on-quarter, as client balances are seasonally highest at year -end.
Loans were up 5% year -on-year and up 3% quarter -on-quarter excluding PPP. C&I loans were up 3% sequentially ex PPP, reflecting higher
revolver utilization and originations across middle market an d corporate client banking. CRE loans were up 3% driven by strong loan
originations and funding across the portfolio.
And then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with a  pre-tax
margin of 30%. Revenue of $4.3 billion was up 6% year -on-year, as growth in deposits and loans and higher management fees and
performance fees in alternative investments were partially offset by deposit margin compression and the absence of investment  valuati on
gains from the prior year.
Expenses of $2.9 billion were up 11% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments as well as higher
volume and revenue related expenses. For the quarter, net long -term inflows of $19 billio n were positive across all channels with strength in
equities, multi -asset and alternatives, and in liquidity, we saw net outflows of $52 billion.
AUM of $3 trillion and overall client assets of $4.1 trillion, up 4% and 8% year -on-year respectively, were driven by strong net inflows. And
finally, loans were up 3% quarter -on-quarter with continued strength in mortgages and securities -based lending, while deposits were up 9%.
Turning to Corporate on page 8, Corporate reported a net loss of $856 million. Rev enue was a loss of $881 million, down $408 million year -
on-year. NII was up $319 million due to the impact of higher rates, and NIR was down $727 million due to losses on legacy equity  investments
versus gains last year, as well as approximately $400 milli on of net realized losses on investment securities this quarter. Expenses of $184
million were lower by $692 million year -on-year, primarily due to the contribution to the firm's foundation in the prior year.
Next, the outlook on page 9. We still expect N II ex Markets to be in excess of $53 billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately $77
billion. And we'll update these and give you more color at Investor Day next month.
So to wrap up, once again this quarter the company's performance was strong in a  particularly volatile and challenging environment. We
helped our clients navigate very difficult markets, provided support to relief efforts and implemented economic sanctions of unprecedented
complexity with multiple directives from governments around th e world. And, of course, our thoughts remain with everyone, including our
employees, affected by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Looking ahead, the US economy remains robust, but we're watching high inflation, the reversal of QE and rising rates, as well  as the ongoing
effects of the war on the global economy.
With that, operator, please open the line for Q&A.","Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $8.3 billion, EPS of $2.63, on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 16%.

2022_Q2,"Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our webs ite, and please refer to the disclaimer in the back.
Starting on page 1. The firm reported net income of $8.6 billion, EPS of $2.76 on revenue of $31.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 17%.
Touching on a few highlights, we had another quarter of strong performance in markets, which generated revenue of nearly $8 billion. Credit is
still quite healthy, and net charge- offs remain historically low. And there continue to be positive trends in loan growth across our businesses,
with average loans up 7% year -on-year and 2% quarter -on-quarter.
On page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $31.6 billion was up $235 million or 1% year -on-year. NII ex markets was up $2.8 billion or
26%, driven by higher rates and balance sheet growth. NIR ex markets was down $3.6 billion or 26%, largely driven by lower IB fees and
higher card acquisition costs. And markets revenue was up $1 billion or 15% year -on-year.
Expenses of $18.7 billion were up $1.1 billion or 6% year -on-year, predominantly on higher investments and struc tural expenses, partially
offset by lower volume-  and revenue- related expenses. And credit costs were $1.1 billion, which included net charge- offs of $657 million and
reserve builds of $428 million, reflecting loan growth as well as a modest deterioration in the economic outlook.
On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. Let's start by talking about our plans for capital managem ent over the coming quarters. The new
4% SCB will raise our standardized CET1 requirement to 12% effective in the fourth quarter,  and the 4% GSIB effective in 1Q 2023 further
raises this requirement to 12.5%. At Investor Day, we said that we expected SCB t o be higher and made it clear that in the near -term, share
buybacks would be significantly reduced in order to build capital for the increased requirements. In light of the SCB coming in even higher than
expected, we have paused buybacks for the near -term.
As we discussed at Investor Day and as we show at the bottom of this presentation page, our organic capital generation allows  us to rapidly
build capital in excess of future requirements, with a current target of roughly 12.5% in the fourth quarter. Any excess  over the regulatory
requirements offers us protection against a range of economic scenarios with room to deploy capital in  line with our strategic priorities. We
have a long- established track record of balance sheet discipline across the company, and this quarter's RWA reduction shows evidence of this
discipline.
Turning to this quarter's results, you can see that our CET1 r atio of 12.2% is up 30 basis points from the prior quarter. Our RWA was down
approximately $44 billion with growth in franchise lending being more than offset by the combination of active balance sheet management and
the normalization of market risk RWA fr om the first quarter. CET1 capital was slightly down as earnings were offset by distributions and the
impact of AOCI drawdowns in our AFS portfolio.
Now, let's go to our businesses starting with Consumer & Community Banking on page 4. Before I review CCB' s performance, let me touch on
what we're seeing in our data regarding the health of the US consumer. Spend is still healthy wi th combined debit and credit spend up 15%
year-on-year. We see the impact of inflation and higher nondiscretionary spend across i ncome segments. Notably, the average consumer is
spending 35% more year -on-year on gas and approximately 6% more on recurring bills and other nondiscretionary categories.
At the same time, we have yet to observe a pullback in discretionary spending including in the lower income segments with travel and dining growing a robust 34% year -on-year overall. And with spending growing faster than incomes, median deposit balances are down across
income segments for the first time since the pandemic started though c ash buffers still remain elevated.
With that as a backdrop, this quarter, CCB reported net income of $3.1 billion on revenue of $12.6 billion which was down 1% year -on-year. In
Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 9% year -on-year driven by growth i n deposits. Deposits were up 13% year -on-year and 2%
quarter -on-quarter, and client investment assets were down 7% year -on-year driven by market performance partially offset by flows.
Home Lending revenue was down 26% year -on-year, as the rate environment  drove both lower production revenue and tighter spreads,
partially offset by higher net servicing revenue and mortgage origination volume of $22 billion was down 45%.
Moving to Card & Auto , revenue was down 6% year -on-year reflecting higher acquisition c osts on strong new card account originations and
lower auto lease income largely offset by higher card NII. Card outstandings were up 16%, and revolving balances were up 9%. And in auto, originations were $7 billion down 44% from record levels a year ago due to continued lack of vehicle supply and rising rates while loans were up 2%. Expenses of $7.7 billion were up 9% year -on-year driven by higher investments of structural expenses partially offset by lower volume-
and revenue- related expenses.
In terms of actual credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $761 million reflecting net charge- offs of $611 million, dow n $121 million
year-on-year driven by C ard and a reserve build of $150 million in C ard driven by loan growth.
Next, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $3.7 billion on revenue of $11.9 billion. There were a number of notable items this
quarter, including net markdowns on certain equity investments of approximately $370 million, with about $345 million reflected in pay ments
and m arkdowns on the bridge book of approximately $250 million in IB revenue.
Investment Banking revenue of $1.4 billion was  down 61% year -on-year or down 53% excluding the bridge book markdowns. IB fees were
down 54% versus an all -time record quarter last year. We maintained our number -one rank with a year -to-date wallet share of 8.1%. In
Advisory, fees were down 28% reflecting a decline in announced activity which started in the first quarter. The volatile market resulted in
muted issuance in our underwriting businesses.
Underwriting fees were down 53% for debt and down 77% for equity. In terms of outlook, while our existing pipeline remains healthy,
conversion of the deal backlog may be challenging if the current headwinds continue. Lending revenue of $410 m illion was up 79% versus the
prior year driven by gains on mark -to-market hedges as  well as higher loan balances.
Moving to Markets , total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 15% year -on-year in both Fixed Income and E quities against a strong quarter last year.
In Fixed Income, elevated volatility drove both increased client flows and robust t rading results in the macro franchise, most notably in
currencies and emerging markets. This was partially offset by credit and securitized products in a challenging spread environment. In E quity
Markets, we had a strong second quarter and again increased volatility produced a strong performance in derivatives. Credit Adjustments &
Other was a loss of $218 million largely driven by funding spread widening.
Payments revenue w as $1.5 billion, up 1% year -on-year or up 25% excluding the markdowns on equity inv estments. The year -on-year growth
was primarily driven by higher rates. Security Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year -on-year with growth in fees and higher rates
more than offsetting the impact of lower market levels. Expenses of $6.7 billion w ere up 3% year -on-year predominantly driven by higher
structural expenses and investments, largely offset by lower revenue- related compensation.
Moving to Commercial Banking on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1 billion. Revenue of $2.7 billion was up 8% year -on-
year driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower I nvestment Banking revenue. Gross I nvestment Banking revenue of $788
million was d own 32% driven by lower debt and equity underwriting activity. Expenses of $1.2 bil lion were up 18% year -on-year predominantly
driven by higher structural and volume-  and revenue- related expenses. Deposits were down 5% quarter -on-quarter driven by migration of non-
operating deposits in to higher yielding alternatives which we expect to continue given the current rate environment.
Loans were up 4% sequentially. C&I loans were up 6% reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across middle mar ket and
corporate client banking. CRE loans were up 3% driven by strong loan originations and funding in commercial term lending and real estate
banking. Finally, credit costs of $209 million were largely driven by loan growth while net charge- offs remain hist orically low.
Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion with pre- tax margin of
31%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.3 billion was up 5% year -on-year driven by growth in deposits and l oans as well as higher margins,
partially offset by investment valuation losses ver sus gains in the prior year. In addition, reductions in management fees linked to this year's
market declines have been almost entirely offset by the removal of most money m arket fund fee waivers. Expenses of $2.9 billion were up
13% year -on-year, largely driven by investments in our private banking advisory teams, technology and asset management, as well as higher
volume-  and revenue- related expenses.
For the quarter, net l ong-term inflows of $6 billion were driven by equities. AUM of $2.7 trillion and ov erall client assets of $3.8 trillion down 8%

were up 1% quarter -on-quarter while deposits were down 7% sequentially driven by seasonal client tax payments.
Turning to C orporate on page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $174 million. Revenue was $80 million versus a loss in the prior year. NII
was $324 million, up $1.3 billion predominantly due to the impact of higher rates, and expenses of $206 million were lower by $309 million
year-on-year.
Next, the outlook on page 9. You w ill recall that at Investor Day, we expected NII ex markets for 2022 to be in excess of $56 billion. We now
expect it to be in excess of $58 billion reflecting Fed funds reaching 3.5% by year -end. We still expect adjusted expense to be approximately
$77 billion and the C ard net charge- off rate to be less than 2% for 2022.
So to wrap up, the company's performance was strong again this quart er in what was a complex operating environment. As we look forward,
we are mindful of the elevated uncertainty in the global economy, but we feel confident that we are prepared and well -positioned for a broad
range of outcomes.

2022_Q3,"Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. As always, the presentation is available on our website , and please refer to the disclaimer in
the back.
Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.7 billion, EPS of $3.12 on revenue of $33.5 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 18%.
The only significant item this quarter was discretionary net invest ment securities losses in Corporate of $959 million  as a result of repositioning
the portfolio by selling US Treasuries and mortgages.
Our strong results this quarter reflect the resilience of the franchise in a dynamic environment. Touching on a few high lights, we had record
third quarter revenue in Markets of $6.8 billion. We ranked number 1 in retail deposit share based on FDIC data, and credit i s still healthy with
net charge -offs remaining low.
On page 2, we have more detail. Revenue of $33.5 billion  was up $3.1 billion or 10% year -on-year. Excluding the net investment securities
losses, it was up 13%. NII ex Markets was up $5.7 billion or 51%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex Markets was down $3.2 billio n or 24%, largely
driven by lower IB fees and the  securities losses. And Markets revenue was up $502 million or 8% year -on-year.
Expenses of $19.2 billion were up $2.1 billion or 12% year -on-year, driven by higher structural costs and investments. And credit costs of $1.5
billion included net charge -offs of $727 million. The net reserve build of  $808 million included a $937 million build in Wholesale, reflecting loan
growth and updates to the firm's macroeconomic scenarios, partially offset by $150 million release in Home Lending.
On to balance sheet an d capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 12.5%, up 30 basis points versus the prior quarter,
which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions, partially offset by the impact of AOCI. RWA was d own approximatel y
$23 billion quarter -on-quarter with growth in lending more than offset by continued active balance sheet management and lower market risk
RWA.
Given our results this quarter, we are well positioned to meet our CET1 targets of 12.5% in the fourth quarter  and 13% in the first quarter of
2023. These current targets include a 50 basis point buffer over the growing regulatory requirements, which provides flexibil ity over the coming
quarters.
To conclude on capital, with the future increases in our risk -base d requirements, SLR will no longer be our binding capital constraint. So, we
announced the call of $5.4 billion in preferreds this quarter and issued $3.5 billion in sub debt to rebalance our capital stack.
Now, let's go to our businesses starting on page 4. Before I review CCB's performance, let me provide you with an update on the health of US
consumers and small businesses based on our data. Nominal spend is still strong across both discretionary and non -discretionary categories,
with combined debit  and credit spend up 13% year -on-year.
Cash buffers remain elevated across all income segments . However, with spending growing faster than income, we are seeing a continued
decrease in median deposits year -on-year, particularly in the lower income segment s. And not surprisingly, small business owners are
increasingly focused on the risks in the economic outlook.
Now, moving to financial results. This quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.3 billion on revenue of $14.3 billion, which wa s up 14% year -on-
year. In Consumer & Business Banking, revenue was up 30% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Deposits were up 10% year -
on-year and down 1% quarter -on-quarter.
We ranked number 1 in retail deposit share based on FDIC data, up 60  basis points  year-on-year, making us the fastest -growing among the
top 20 banks. And we are now number 1 in LA in addition to New York and Chicago, making us top -ranked in the three largest markets. Client
investment assets were down 10% year -on-year, driven by market p erformance, partially offset by flows. Home Lending revenue was down
34% year -on-year, on lower production margins and volume.
Moving to Card & Auto, revenue was up 9% year -on-year driven by higher Card NII, partially offset by lower auto lease income. Ca rd
outstandings were up 18% , and while revolving balances were up 15%, driven by strong net new account originations and growth in revolving
balances per account, they still remain slightly below pre -pandemic levels. And in Auto, originations were $7.5 bil lion, down 35% due to the
lack of vehicle supply and rising rates.
Expenses of $8 billion were up 11% year -on-year, driven by the investments we're making in technology, travel, marketing and branches. In
terms of actual credit performance this quarter, c redit costs were $529 million, reflecting net charge -offs of $679 million, which were up $188
million year -on-year, largely driven by loan growth in Card, as well as a reserve release of $150 million in Home Lending. Card delinquencies
remain well below pr e-pandemic levels, though we continue to see gradual normalization.
Next, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $3.5 billion on revenue of $11.9 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $ 1.7 billion was
down 43% year -on-year. IB fees were down 47% v ersus a strong third quarter last year. We maintained our number 1 rank with a year -to-date
wallet share of 8.1%. In Advisory, fees were down 31%, reflecting lower announced activity this year. Underwriting businesses continued to be
affected by market vol atility, resulting in fees down 40% for debt and down 72% for equity.
In terms of the fourth quarter outlook, we expect to be down versus a very strong prior year. And while our existing pipeline  is healthy,
conversion will, of course, depend on market co nditions. Lending revenue of $323 million was up 32% versus the prior year, driven by higher
NII on loan growth.
Moving to Markets, revenue was $6.8 billion, up 8% year -on-year. Fixed Income was up 22%, as elevated volatility drove strong client activity
in the macro franchise, partially offset by a less favorable environment in  securitized products. Equity Markets were down 11% against a
record third quarter last year. This quarter saw relative strength in derivatives, lower balances in prime, and lower cash revenues on lower
block activity.
Payments revenue was $2 billion, up 22% year -on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, it was up 41% and the year -on-year
growth was driven by higher rates and growth in fees. Securities Services  revenue of  $1.1 billion was relatively flat year -on-year. Expenses of
$6.6 billion were up 13% year -on-year, largely driven by compensation. Credit costs were $513 million, driven by a net reserve build of $486
million.
Moving to Commercial Banking on pa ge 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $946 million. Record revenue of $3 billion was up 21%
year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower Investment Banking revenue. Gross Investment Banking revenu e of
$761 million was  down 43% year -on-year, driven by reduced capital markets activity. Expenses of $1.2 billion were up 14% year -on-year.
Deposits were down 6% year -on-year and quarter -on-quarter, primarily driven by attrition of non -operating balances, while our core operat ing
balances have shown stability as payment volumes continue to be robust.
Loans were up 13% year -on-year and 4% sequentially. C&I loans were up 7% sequentially, reflecting continued strength in originations and
revolver utilization. CRE loans were up 2%  sequentially, driven by lower prepayment activity in Commercial Term Lending and Real Estate
Banking. Finally, credit costs were $618 million, predominantly driven by a net reserve build of $587 million, while net charg e-offs remained
low.
And then to co mplete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of
$1.2 billion with pre -tax margin of 36%. For the quarter, revenue of $4.5 billion was up 6% year -on-year, predominantly driven by deposits and
loans on higher mar gins and balances, largely offset by reductions in management fees linked to this year's market declines.
Expenses of $3 billion were up 10% year -on-year, driven by compensation including investments in our Private Banking advisor teams,
technology, and a sset management initiatives. For the quarter, net long -term inflows were  $12 billion across Fixed income, Equities and
Alternatives. AUM of $2.6 trillion and overall client assets of $3.8 trillion were down 13% and 7% year -on-year, respectively, driven by lower
market levels, partially offset by continued net inflows. And finally, loans were flat quarter -on-quarter, while deposits were down 6%
sequentially, driven by migration to investments, partially offset by client flows.
Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported a net loss of $294 million. Revenue was a net loss of $302 million compared to a net loss
of $1.3 billion last year. NII was $792 million, up $1.8 billion year -on-year, driven by the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $1.1  billion,
down $852 million, primarily due to the securities losses I mentioned up front. And expenses of $305 million were higher by $ 145 million year -
on-year.
Next, the outlook on page 9. Going forward, we will also provide guidance for total firm wide NII. For the fourth quarter, we expect it to be
approximately $19 billion, implying full -year 2022 NII of approximately $66 billion. And we expect NII ex Markets for the fourth quarter to also
be about $19 billion, implying that we expect Markets NII to be around zero, which brings the full year to about $61.5 billion.
While we're not giving 2023 NII guidance today, you will recall that at Investor Day, we talked about a fourth quarter 2022 N II ex Markets run
rate of $66 billion with potential upside for the  full-year 2023. Today's guidance for the fourth quarter of this year implies an approximate run
rate of $76 billion, and from this much higher level, we would now expect some modest decline for the full -year 2023.
In addition, there's quite a bit of unc ertainty surrounding the trajectory of key drivers, including rates, deposit reprice, and loan growth. So,
keep both of those things in mind as you update the 2023 estimates in your models.
Moving to expenses, our outlook remains unchanged. And as it rela tes to the Card net charge -off rate, we now expect the full -year rate to be
approximately 1.5%, below our previous expectations. So, to wrap up, we are happy with the strong diversified performance of the quarter, as
we continue to navigate an environment of elevated uncertainty.
With that, I will turn it over to Jamie for some additional remarks .
Yeah, Jeremy, thank you very much. Hello, everybody. Yeah, I just want to give you a little more insight into how we're looking at capital ,
interest rates a little bit. So, capital planning, we're very comfortable with the earnings power of this company , which you could see is
enormous and the margins and the returns . And more importantly than that is that we're growing franchise value, I think, all  around the firm.
And in most areas, we're up in market share; in a few areas we're not , and of course, that disappoints us.
But the earnings power gives us lot of confidence that we'll get over  that 13% in the first quarter, but we always have to keep in mind the
volatility and a bunch of other things. So, we know we have to deal with Basel IV. We don't know when and how this is going t o be and any
change in G-SIB. Such is an uncertainty in  the back of our mind.
AOCI; AOCI was traditionally countercyclical, but in this kind of environment is more pro -cyclical . So think of if rates go up another 100 basis
points, that's $4 billion. Easily can handle it, just in the back of our mind.
CECL; CECL already incorporates a percent  of what we think the adverse consequences might be. But obviously, if the environment gets
worse, we'll have to add to reserves , and/or if we change our outlook, meaning that we think the chance of adverse e vents are higher, we'll
change our reserves. Put in the back of your mind that if unemployment goes to 5% or 6%, you're probably talking about $5 bil lion or $6 billion
over the course of a couple of quarters. Again, easy to handle, not a big deal. It just does affect capital a little bit.
And then RWA management . I mean, I think we're showing that we can easily manage RWA and drive it down in some areas and up in other
areas and stuff like that with w hat I would say a very limited financial effect. And the  way you should look at this is  that we don't tell the
commercial bank or investment bank don't get new business, don't serve your clients . So we're serving clients the way we always do , and you
see the loan book growing in a lot of areas.
But there are s ome discretionary things which barely affect us . So we're not putting conforming mortgage on the balance sheet, whether we
originate them or whether correspondents originate them, for the most part, because it makes very low sense to do that on the balance  sheet ,
and we make other choices. And so, there are a lot of tools to manage it. Obviously, with the capital requirements going up, we're going to find
ways to reduce RWA, and I'm talking about over the years strategically, I think without affecting our b asic franchises.
Interest rates ; I think the way to look at it is, we're fairly neutral at this point to interest rates going up or down. Jeremy said the $19 billion,
please do not annualize that. There are a lot of uncertainties today , and I'm just going to mention a few. We're not worried about them. It's not
going to change things dramatically, but it does change things. What's going to be QT's effect on deposits? How much deposit migration
you're going to have in this new  technologic al environment? And there are pluses and minuses in that. And, of course, there are lags, there
are lags in consumer, there's going to be some lags in Treasury Services, there's going to be some lags in Commercial Banking . So, it's just in
the back of our mind, and we're going to kind of actively manage that.
And the other thing I want to point out is that taking investment securities losses, for the most part, is because we  want to sell  rich securities
and replace them with cheap securities. We don't want to be locked into something we think will get worse and  not take a chance to buy
something that we think will get better. So, you might expect to see that taking place now, that maybe some securities loss es in the future . We
can do that.
We're not doing – we can do this to manage interest rate exposure, but for the most part, we can do that with swaps too or other things . We
just do it the most efficient and effective way. And I want the people managing these portfolios to know that we can sell thi ngs we don't want to
own and buy things that we do want to own. And other than that, we think it was a very good, strong quarter across the board.
And I guess we'll open for questions now.
Yeah. Thanks, Jamie. Let's go ahead and open up for questions.","Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.7 billion, EPS of $3.12 on revenue of $33.5 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 18%.

2022_Q4,"Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer  in the back.
Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $11 billion, EPS of $3.57 on revenue of $35.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 20%. This
quarter, we had two significant items in Corporate, a $914 million gain on the sale of Visa B shares, offset by $874 million of net investment
securities losses.
Touching on a few highlights, combined credit and debit spend is up 9% year -on-year with growth in both discretionary and non -discretionary
spending. We ended the year ranked #1 for Global IB fees, with a wallet share of 8%, and credit continues to normalize but actual
performance remains strong across the company.
On page 2 , we have more on our fourth quarter results. Revenue of $35.6 billion was up $5.2 billion or 17% year -on-year. NII ex Markets was
up $8.4 billion or 72%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex Markets was down $3.5 billion or 26%, predominantly driven by lower IB fees as well as
management and performance fees in AWM, lower Auto lease income and Home Lending production revenue. And Markets revenue was up
$382 million or 7% y ear-on-year.
Expenses of $19 billion were up $1.1 billion or 6% year -on-year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments. And credit
costs of $2.3 billion included net charge -offs of $887 million. The net reserve build of $1.4 billion w as driven by updates to the firm's
macroeconomic outlook, which now reflects a mild recession in the central case, as well as loan growth in Card Services, part ially offset by a
reduction in pandemic -related uncertainty.
Looking at the full year results o n page 3, the firm reported net income of $37.7 billion, EPS of $12.09 and record revenue of $132.3 billion,
and we delivered an ROTCE of 18%.
Onto balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.2%, up 70 basis points, p rimarily driven by the
benefit of net income, including the sale of Visa B shares less distributions, AOCI gains and lower RWA. RWA declined approxi mately $20
billion quarter -on-quarter, reflecting lower RWA in the Markets business which was partially offs et by an increase in lending, primarily in Card
Services. Recall that we had a 13% CET1 target for the first quarter of 2023, which we have now reached one quarter early. So , given that, we
expect to resume share repurchases this quarter.
Now, let's go to  our businesses starting on page 5. Starting with a quick update on the health of US consumers and small businesses based
on our data. They are generally on solid footing, although sentiment for both reflects recessionary concerns not yet fully re flected i n our data.
Combined debit and credit spend is up 9% year -on-year. Both discretionary and non -discretionary spend are up year -on-year, the strongest
growth in discretionary being travel. Retail spend is up 4% on the back of a particularly strong fourth quarter last year.
E-commerce spend was up 7%, while in -person spend was roughly flat. Cash buffers for both consumers and small businesses continue to
slowly normalize with lower income segments and smaller businesses normalizing faster. Consumer cash buffers for the lower income
segments are expected to be back to pre -pandemic levels by the third quarter this year.
Now, moving to financial results. This quarter, CCB reported net income of $4.5 billion on revenue of $15.8 billion, which wa s up 29%  year-on-
year. You'll notice in our presentation that we renamed Consumer & Business Banking to Banking & Wealth Management. Starting there,
revenue was up 56% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Deposits were down 3% quarter -on-quarter as spend remains strong
and the rate cycle plays out, with outflows being partially offset by new relationships.
Client investment assets were down 10% year -on-year, driven by market performance, partially offset by net inflows – where we are seeing
good mom entum, including from our deposit customer. Home Lending revenue was down 46% year -on-year, largely driven by lower
production revenue.
Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 12% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card Services NII on hi gher revolving
balances, partially offset by lower Auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 19%. Total revolving balances were up 20%, a nd we are
now back to pre -pandemic levels. However, revolving balances per account are still below pre -pandemic leve ls, which should be a tailwind in
2023. And in Auto, originations were $7.5 billion, down 12%.
Expenses of $8 billion were up 3% year -on-year, primarily driven by investments as well as higher compensation, largely offset by Auto lease
depreciation from l ower volumes. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.8 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $800
million in Card and $200 million in Home Lending, and net charge -offs of $845 million, up $330 million year -on-year.
Next, the CIB  on page 6. CIB reported net income of $3.3 billion on revenue of $10.5 billion for the fourth quarter. Investment Banking rev enue
of $1.4 billion was down 57% year -on-year. IB fees were down 58%, in line with the market. In Advisory, fees were down 53%, r eflecting lower
announced activity earlier in the year. Our underwriting businesses were affected by market conditions resulting in fees down  58% for debt
and down 69% for equity.
In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same. Pipeline is relative ly robust, but conversion is very sensitive to market conditions and
sentiment about the economic outlook. Also, note that it will be a difficult compare against last year's first quarter.
Moving to Markets, revenue was $5.7 billion, up 7% year -on-year, d riven by the strength in our macro franchise. Fixed Income was up 12%,
as elevated volatility drove strong client activity, particularly in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets, while Securitiz ed Products continue
to be challenged by the market environm ent. Equity Markets was relatively flat against a strong fourth quarter last year.
Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 15% year -on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, it was up 56% and the year -on-year
growth was driven by higher rates . Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher rates,
largely offset by lower deposits and market levels.
Expenses of $6.4 billion were up 10% year -on-year, predominantly driven by the timing of revenu e-related compensation. On a full -year basis,
expenses of $27.1 billion were up 7% year -on-year, primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments, partially offset by lower
revenue -related compensation.
Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 7 . Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.4 billion. Record revenue of $3.4 billion was up
30% year -on-year, driven by higher deposit margins, partially offset by lower Investment Banking revenue and deposit -related fees. Gross
Investment Banking reve nue of $700 million was down 52% year -on-year, driven by reduced capital markets activity. Expenses of $1.3 billion
were up 18% year -on-year.
Deposits were down 14% year -on-year and 1% quarter -on-quarter, primarily reflecting attrition of non -operating de posits. Loans were up 14%
year-on-year and 3% sequentially. C&I loans were up 4% quarter -on-quarter, reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver
utilization. CRE loans were up 2% quarter -on-quarter, reflecting a slower pace of growth from ea rlier in the year due to higher rates, which
impacts both originations and prepayment activity.
Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion with pre -tax margin
of 33%. Revenue of $4. 6 billion was up 3% year -on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances, predominantly offset by
reductions in management, performance and placement fees linked to this year's market declines. Expenses of $3 billion were u p 1% year -on-
year, pr edominantly driven by growth in our private banking advisor teams, largely offset by lower performance -related compensation.
For the quarter, net long -term inflows were $10 billion, positive across Equities and Fixed Income, and $47 billion for the full y ear. And in
liquidity, we saw net inflows of $33 billion for the quarter and net outflows of $55 billion for the full year. AUM of $2.8 t rillion and overall client
assets of $4 trillion were down 11% and 6% year -on-year, respectively, driven by lower marke t levels. Finally, loans were down 1% quarter -
on-quarter, driven by lower securities -based lending; while deposits were down 6% sequentially, driven by the rising rate environment –
resulting in migration to investments and other cash alternatives.
Turning to Corporate on page 9. Corporate reported a net gain of $581 million. Revenue of $1.2 billion was up $1.7 billion ye ar-on-year. NII
was $1.3 billion, up $2 billion year -on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $115 million and  reflects the two significant
items I mentioned earlier. And expenses of $339 million were up $88 million year -on-year.
With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2023, which I will cover over the next few pages, starting with NII on page 10. Oka y. We expe ct total NII
to be approximately $73 billion and NII ex Markets to be approximately $74 billion. On the page, we show how the significant increases in
quarterly NII throughout 2022 culminated in the $81 billion run rate for the fourth quarter and how we ex pect that to evolve for 2023.
Going through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve. The combination of the annualization of t he hike in late
December, the hikes expected early in the year, and the cuts expected later in the y ear should be a net tailwind. Offsetting that tailwind is the
impact of deposit repricing, which includes our best guess of rate paid in both Wholesale and Consumer.
In addition, looking at balance sheet growth and mix, we expect solid overall Card spend growth as well as further normalization of revolving
balances per account and modest loan growth across the rest of the company. We expect that this tailwind will be offset by lo wer deposit
balances, given modest attrition in both Consumer and Wholesale.
But it's very important to note that this NII outlook is particularly uncertain. Specifically, Fed Funds could deviate from f orwards, balance
attrition and migration assumptions could be meaningfully different, and deposit product and pricing decisions wil l be determined by customer
behavior and competitive dynamics as we focus on maintaining and growing primary bank relationships – and may be quite different from what
this outlook assumes. And further, the timing of all these factors could significantly af fect the sequential trajectory of NII throughout the year.
That said, as we continue executing our strategy of investing to acquire new customers as well as deepen relationships with e xisting ones and
as we see the impact of loan growth, we would expect s equential NII growth to return, all else being equal. And just to finish up on NII, as the
guidance indicates, we expect Markets NII for the year to be slightly negative as a result of higher rates, but remember, thi s is offset in
Markets NIR.
Now, turnin g to expenses on page 11. We expect 2023 adjusted expense to be about $81 billion, which includes approximately $500 million
from the higher FDIC assessment. Going through some of the other drivers, we expect increases from labor inflation, which, wh ile it seems to
be abating on a forward -looking basis, is effectively in the run rate for 2023. An additional labor -related driver is the annualization of 2022
headcount growth as well as our plans for more modest headcount increases this year – all of which are  primarily in connection with executing
our investments.
And on investments, while we are continuing to invest consistent with what we told you at Investor Day, it's a more modest in crease than last
year. The themes remain consistent, and we will continue  to give you more detail throughout the year, including at Investor Day in May. Of
course, as is always true, this outlook includes continuing to generate efficiencies across the company. And finally, while v olume - and
revenue -related expense was ultimatel y a tailwind for 2022, we are expecting it to be close to flat in 2023, which will be completely market
dependent, as always.
Moving to credit on page 12. On the page, you can see how exceptionally benign the credit environment was in 2022 for the com pany  across
Wholesale, Card and the rest of Consumer. Turning to the 2023 outlook for Card net charge -off rates specifically, Marianne gave quite a bit of
detail about this at a recent conference and our outlook hasn't really changed. So to recap that story, t he entry to delinquency rate is the
leading indicator of future charge -offs, and it is currently around 80% of pre -pandemic levels. We expect that to normalize around the middle of
the year, with the associated charge -offs following about six months later.  As a result, loss rates in 2023 will still be normalizing. So while we
anticipate exiting the year around normalized levels, we expect the 2023 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 2.6%, up from the
historically low rate of 147 basis points in 202 2 but still well below fully normalized levels.
So let's turn to page 13 for a brief wrap up before going to Q&A. We're very proud of the 2022 results, producing an 18% ROTC E and a record
revenue in what was a quite dynamic environment. Throughout my disc ussion of the outlook, I've emphasized the uncertainty in many of the
key drivers of 2023 results. And while we are ready for a range of scenarios, our expectation is for another strong performan ce. So as we look
forward, we expect to continue to produce s trong returns in the near term and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our through -the-
cycle target of 17% ROTCE.
And with that, operator, let's open up the line for Q&A.","Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $11 billion, EPS of $3.57 on revenue of $35.6 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 20%.

2023_Q1,"Thanks, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website, and please refer to the disclaimer on the b ack.
Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $12.6 billion, EPS o f $4.10 on revenue of $39.3 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 23%.
These results included $868 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate.
Before reviewing our results for the quarter, let's talk about the recent bank failures. Jamie has add ressed a number of the important themes in
his shareholder letter and a recent televised interview so I will go straight to the specific impacts on the firm.
As you would expect, we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and m oney market fund inflows, most
significantly in the Commercial Bank, Business Banking and AWM. Regarding the deposit inflows, at the Firmwide level, average  deposits
were down 3% quarter -on-quarter while end -of-period deposits were up 2% quarter -on-quarter  – implying an intra -quarter reversal of the
recent outflow trend as a consequence of the March events. We estimate that we have retained approximately $50 billion of the se deposit
inflows at quarter -end.
It's important to note that while the sequential p eriod -end deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected, our current full
year NII outlook – which I will address at the end – still assumes modest deposit outflows from here. We expect these outflows to be driven by
the same factors as last quarter, as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarter's inflows.
Now back to the quarter, touching on a few highlights. We grew our IB fee wallet share, consumer spending remains solid with combined debit
and credit card spe nd up 10% year -on-year, and credit continues to normalize, but actual performance remains strong across the company.
On page 2, we have some more detail. Revenue of $39.3 billion was up $7.7 billion or 25% year -on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $9.2 billion
or 78%, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was down $1.1 billion or 10%, dri ven by the
securities losses previously mentioned as well as lower IB fees and lower auto lease income on lower volume, and Market s revenue was
down $371 million or 4% year -on-year.
Expenses of $20.1 billion were up $916 million or 5% year -on-year, driven by compensation -related costs reflecting the annualization of last
year's headcount growth and wage inflation. These results inc lude the impact of the higher FDIC assessment I mentioned last quarter which,
of course, is unrelated to recent events. And credit costs of $2.3 billion included net charge -offs of $1.1 billion, predominantly in Card. The net
reserve build of $1.1 billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weighted -average economic outlook.
On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.8%, up about 60 basis points, which w as primarily
driven by the benefit of net income les s distributions and AOCI gains. And in line with what we previously said, we resumed stock buybacks
this quarter and distributed a total of $1.9 billion in net repurchases back to shareholders.
Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 4. Touching quickly on the health of U.S. consumers and small businesses based
on our data. Both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization, as expected, but we continue to monito r their activity
closely. Spend remains solid and we ha ve not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter.
Moving to financial results, CCB reported net income of $5.2 billion, on revenue of $16.5 billion, which was up 35% year -on-year. In Banking
and Wealth Management, revenue was up 67% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. Average deposits were down 2% quarter -
on-quarter, in line with recent trends. Throughout the quarter, we continued to see customer flows to higher yielding products a s you would
expect, but we're encouraged by what we are capturing in CDs and our wealth management offerings. Client investment assets were down
1% year -on-year, but up 7% quarter -on-quarter, driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was
down 38% year -on-year, l argely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue.
Moving to Card Services and Auto – revenue was up 14% year -on-year, largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving
balances, partially offset  by lower Auto lease income. Credit card spend was up 13% year -on-year. Card outstandings were up 21%, driven by
strong new account growth and revolve normalization. And in Auto, originations were $9.2 billion, up 10% year -on-year. Expenses of $8.1
billion  were up 5% year -on-year reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher headcount. In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit
costs were $1.4 billion, reflecting reserve builds of $300 million in Card and $50 million in Home Lending. Net charg e-offs were $1.1 billion, up
about $500 million year -on-year, in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios.
Next, the CIB on page 5. CIB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment  Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was
down 24% year -on-year. IB fees were down 19%. We ranked number one with first quarter wallet share of 8.7%. In advisory, fees were down
6% compared to a strong first quarter last year. Our underwriting businesses contin ued to be affected by market conditions with fees down
34% for debt and 6% for equity.
In terms of the outlook, the dynamics remain the same: our pipeline is relatively robust, but conversion is sensitive to mark et conditions and
the economic outlook. We expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging.
Moving to Markets, total revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4% year -on-year. Fixed Income was flat. Rates was strong during the rally early in the
quarter, as well as throug h the elevated volatility in March. Credit was up on the back of higher client flows and Currencies & Emerging
Markets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in  the prior year. Equity Markets was down 12%, driven by lower revenues in
derivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity in Cash.
Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, up 26% year -on-year. Excluding the net impact of equity investments, primarily a gain in the prior year, it
was up 55%, with the gro wth driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.1 billion was
up 7% year -on-year, driven by higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels. Expenses of $7.5 billion were up 2%
year-on-year as higher headcount and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenue -related compensation.
Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $3.5 billion was up 46%
year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2 billion was up 98% year -on-year driven by higher rates, and gross
Investment Banking revenue of $881 million was up 21% year -on-year on increased M&A and bond underwriting from large deal act ivity.
Expenses of $1.3 billion were up 16% year -on-year, largely driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and
technology investments, as well as higher volume -related expense. Average deposits were down 16% year -on-year and 5%  quarter -on-
quarter, predominantly driven by continued attrition in non -operating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances.
Loans were up 13% year -on-year and 1% sequentially. C&I loans were up 1% quarter -on-quarter, with somewhat different dynamics based on
client size. In Middle Market Banking, higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization, wh ich is also
leading to weakness in capex spending.
In Corporate Client Banking, utilization rates increased modestly quar ter-on-quarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for
bank debt. CRE loans were also up 1% sequentially, with higher rates creating headwinds from both originations and prepayment s. And given
the recent focus on commercial real estate, le t me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than 10% of our portfolio and is focused
in urban dense markets; and nearly two -thirds of our loans are multifamily, primarily in supply constrained markets. Finally, credit costs of
$417 million incl uded a net reserve build of $379 million predominantly driven by what I mentioned upfront.
Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre -tax margin
of 35%. Revenue of $4.8 bil lion was up 11% year -on-year, driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our
initial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our Asset Management Joint Venture in China, partially offset by the  impact of lower
avera ge market levels on management fees and lower performance fees. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 8% year -on-year, predominantly
driven by compensation, reflecting growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue -related compensation and the run -rate impact
of acquisitions.
For the quarter, net long -term inflows were $47 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $93 billion,
inclusive of our ongoing deposit migration. AUM of $3 trillion was up 2% year -on-year and overall client assets of $4.3 trillion were up 6%
driven by continued net inflows into liquidity and long -term products. And finally, loans were down 1% quarter -on-quarter, driven by lower
securities -based lending, while average deposits were down 5%.
Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $244 million. Revenue was $985 million compared to a net los s of $881
million last year. NII was $1.7 billion, up $2.3 billion year -on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a loss of $755 million compared
with a loss of $345 million in the prior year, and  included the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier. Expenses of $160 million
were down $24 million year -on-year. And credit costs of $370 million were driven by  reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures.
Next, the Outlook on page 9. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $81 billion. This increase in gui dance is
primarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consume r and wholesale in light of the expectation of Fed cuts later in the year, as
well as slightly higher card revolving balances. Note that in line with my comments at the outset, recent deposit balance inc reases are not a
meaningful contributor to the upward  revision in the NII outlook given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later
in the year.
I would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags: we think a more sustainable NII ex. Markets run -rate in t he medium -term
is well below this quarter's $84 billion, as well as below the $80 billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our fu ll year guidance; and
while we don't know exactly when this lower run -rate will be reached, when it happens, we beli eve it will be around the mid -70s.
And, of course, as we mentioned last quarter, this NII outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with th e timing and the
extent of deposit reprice, investment portfolio decisions, the dynamics of QT and RRP, the trajectory of Fed funds, as well as the broader
macroeconomic environment – including its impact on loan growth. Separately, it's worth noting that Markets NII may start to trend slightly
positive towards the end of the year as a function of m ix and rate effects.
Moving to expenses, our outlook for 2023 continues to be about $81 billion. Importantly, this does not currently include the impact of the
pending FDIC special assessment. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 2.6%.
So to wrap up, our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise. We have  benefited from our
fortress principles and commitment to invest, which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment.

Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $14.5 billion, EPS of $4.75 on revenue of $42.4 billion, and delivered an ROTCE of 25%.
These results included the First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, a credit reserve build for the First Republi c lending portfolio of

proceedi ng apace and we are targeting being substantially complete by mid -2024. First Republic employees have formally joined us as of July
2nd and we're pleased to have had very high acceptance rates on our offers. And although it's still early days, as we get th e sales force back in
the market we are happy to see that client retention is strong with about $6 billion of net deposit inflows since the acquisi tion.
Now turning back to this quarter's results on page 3. You'll see that in various parts of the presenta tion, we have specifically called out the
impact of First Republic where relevant. To make things easier, I'm going to start by discussing the overall impact of First Republic on this
quarter's results at the Firmwide level. Then, for the rest of the prese ntation, I will generally exclude the impact of First Republic in order to
improve comparability with prior periods. With that in mind, in this quarter First Republic contributed $4 billion of revenue , $599 million of
expense, and $2.4 billion of net incom e. As noted on the first page, this includes $2.7 billion of bargain purchase gain which is reflected in NIR
in the Corporate segment, as well as $1.2 billion of allowance build. And remember that the deal happened on May 1st, so the First Republic
numbers  only represent two months of results.
You'll see in the line of business results that we are showing First Republic revenue and allowance in CCB, CB and AWM. And f or the
purposes of this quarter's results, all of the deposits are in CCB and substantially  all of the expenses are in Corporate. As the integration
continues, some of those items will get allocated across the segments. Now, turning back to Firmwide results excluding First Republic.
Revenue of $38.4 billion was up $6.7 billion or 21% year -on-year. NII ex. Markets was up $7.8 billion or 57%, driven by higher rates. NIR ex.
Markets was down $293 million , largely driven by the net investment securities losses I mentioned earlier, partially offset by a number of less
notable items primarily in the pr ior year. And Markets revenue was down $772 million or 10% year -on-year. Expenses of $20.2 billion were up
$1.5 billion or 8% year -on-year, primarily driven by higher compensation expense, including wage inflation and higher legal expense. And
credit costs  of $1.7 billion included net charge -offs of $1.4 billion , predominantly in Card.
The net reserve build included a $389 million build in the Commercial Bank, a $200 million build in Card, and a $243 million release in
Corporate, all of which I will cover in more detail later. On to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of
13.8%, flat versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less distributions was offset by the impact of First Republ ic. And as you can
see i n the two charts on the page, we've given you some information about the impact of the transaction on both RWA and CET1 ratio . And as
you know, we completed CCAR a couple of weeks ago. Our new indicative SCB is 2.9% versus our current requirement of 4% and  it goes into
effect in 4Q23. The new SCB also reflects the board's intention to increase the dividend to $1.05 per share in the third quar ter.
On liquidity, our Bank LCR for the second quarter ended at 129%, in line with what we anticipated at Investor D ay. About half of the reduction
is associated with the First Republic transaction. And while we're on the balance sheet, as we previewed in the 10 -K, we will be updating our
Earnings at Risk model to incorporate the impact of deposit repricing lags. So whe n we release this quarter's 10 -Q, you will see the up 100 -
basis point parallel shift scenario will be about positive $2.5 billion whereas in the absence of the change it would have be en about negative
$1.5 billion. Now let's go to our businesses starting w ith CCB on page 5. Both U.S. consumers and small businesses remain resilient and we
haven't observed any meaningful changes to the trends in our data we discussed at Investor Day. Turning now to the financial results which I
will speak to excluding the imp act of First Republic for CCB, CB and AWM. CCB reported net income of $5 billion on revenue of $16.4 billion,
which was up 31% year -on-year.
In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 59% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates. End -of-period deposits were down
4% quarter -on-quarter , as customers continue to spend down their cash buffers, including for seasonal tax payments, and seek higher -yielding
products. Client investment assets were up 18% year -on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows across our advisor and
digital channels. In Home Lending, revenue was down 23% year -on-year, driven by lower NII from tighter loan spreads and lower servicing
and production revenue. Ori ginations were up quarter -on-quarter , driven by seasonality, although still down 54% year -on-year. Moving to Card
Services & Auto, revenue was up 5% , largely driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially offset by lower auto
lease income.
Card outstandings were up 18% year -on-year, which was the result of revolve normalization and strong new account growth. And in Auto,
originations were up $12 billion, up 71% year -on-year as competitors pull back and inventories continue to sl owly recover. Expenses of $8.3
billion were up 8% year -on-year, driven by compensation, predominantly due to wage inflation and headcount growth as we continue to invest
in our front office and technology staffing as well as marketing. In terms of credit p erformance this quarter, our credit costs were $1.5 billion,
reflecting a reserve build of $203 million driven by loan growth in Card Services. Net charge -offs were $1.3 billion, up $640 million year -on-
year, predominantly driven by Card as 30 day -plus del inquencies have returned to pre -pandemic levels, in line with our expectations.
Next, the CIB on page 6. CIB reported net income of $4.1 billion on revenue of $12.5 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $ 1.5 billion was
up 11% year -on-year or down 7% exc luding bridge book markdowns in the prior year. IB fees were down 6% year -on-year and we ranked
number one with year -to-date wallet share of 8.4%. In Advisory, fees were down 19%. Underwriting fees were down 6% for debt and up 30%
for equity with more posi tive momentum in the last month of the quarter. In terms of the second half outlook, we have seen encouraging signs
of activity in Capital Markets and July should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year. However, year -to-date announced M&A is
down significantly, which will be a headwind.
Moving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, down 10% year -on-year. Fixed Income was down 3%. As expected, the macro franchise
substantially normalized from last year's elevated levels of volatility and clien t flows. This was largely offset by improved performance in the
Securitized Products Group and Credit. Equity Markets was down 20% against a very strong prior -year quarter, particularly in derivatives.
Payments revenue was $2.5 billion, up 61% year -on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 32%, predominantly driven by higher rates,
partially offset by lower deposit balances. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 6% year -on-year, driven by higher rates, partially
offset by lower fees. Exp enses of $6.9 billion were up 1% year -on-year, driven by higher non -compensation expense as well as wage inflation
and headcount growth, largely offset by lower revenue -related compensation.
Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 7. Commercial Banking repo rted net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.8 billion was up 42%
year-on-year, driven by higher deposit margins. Payments revenue of $2.2 billion was up 79% year -on-year, driven by higher rates. Gross
Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $767 milli on was down 3% year -on-year, primarily driven by fewer large M&A deals. Expenses of
$1.3 billion were up 12% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation expense, including front office hiring and technology
investments, as well as higher volu me-related expense. Average deposits were up 3% quarter -on-quarter, driven by inflows related to new
client acquisition, partially offset by continued attrition in non -operating deposits. Loans were up 2% quarter -on-quarter. C&I loans were up
2%, reflectin g stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization in the current economic environment, as well as pockets of growth  in
areas where we are investing.
CRE loans were also up 1%, reflecting funding on prior -year originations for construction loans in Real Estate Banking as well as increased
affordable housing activity. Finally, credit costs were $489 million. Net charge -offs were $100 million, including $82 million in the office real
estate portfolio and the net reserve build of $389 million was dri ven by updates to certain assumptions related to the office real estate market
as well as net downgrade activity in Middle Market Banking. Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8. Asset & W ealth
Management reported net income of $1.1 billion  with pre -tax margin of 32%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was up 8% year -on-year, driven by higher
deposit margins on lower balances and higher management fees on strong net inflows. Expenses of $3.2 billion were up 8% year -on-year,
driven by higher compensatio n, including growth in our private banking advisor teams, higher revenue -related compensation, and the impact
of Global Shares and J.P. Morgan Asset Management in China, both of which closed within the last year.
For the quarter, record net long -term infl ows were $61 billion, positive across all channels, regions, and asset classes, led by Fixed Income
and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $60 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 16% year -on-year and overall client assets of $4.6
trillion w ere up 20% year -on-year, driven by continued net inflows, higher market levels, and the impact of the acquisition of Global Shares.
And finally, loans were down 1% quarter -on-quarter, driven by lower securities -based lending and deposits were down 6%. Turn ing to
Corporate on page 9. As I noted upfront, we are reporting the First Republic bargain purchase gain and substantially all of t he expenses in
Corporate. Excluding those items, Corporate reported net income of $339 million. Revenue was $985 million, up  $905 million compared to last
year.
NII was $1.8 billion, up $1.4 billion year -on-year due to the impact of higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $782 million and included the net
investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $590 million were up $384 million year -on-year, largely driven by higher legal
expense. And credit costs were a net benefit of $243 million, reflecting a reserve release as the deposit placed with First R epublic in the first
quarter was eliminated as part of th e transaction. Next, the outlook on page 10. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be
approximately $87 billion, with the increase driven by higher rates coupled with slower deposit reprice than previously assum ed across both
Consumer and Wholesale . And I should take the opportunity to remind you once again that significant sources of uncertainty remain and we
do expect the NII run rate to be substantially below this quarter's run rate at some point in the future as competition for d eposits plays ou t.
Our expense outlook for 2023 remains approximately $84.5 billion. And on credit, we continue to expect the 2023 Card net char ge-off rate to
be approximately 2.6%. So to wrap up, we are proud of the exceptionally strong operating results this quarter. A s we look forward, we remain
focused on the significant uncertainties relating to the economic outlook, competition for deposits, and the impact on capita l from the pending
finalization of the Basel III rules. Nonetheless, despite the likely headwinds ahea d, we remain optimistic about the company's ability to
continue delivering excellent performance through a range of scenarios.

2023_Q3,"Good morning, everybody. Before we start the actual call, I want to repeat something we just said on the press call, so before  we get into the
discussions about third quarter earnings, I just w ant to say how deeply saddened we all are about the recent horrific attacks on Israel and the
resulting bloodshed and more. Terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all the hearts at JPMorgan Chase go out to all
who are suffering.
Thanks, Jamie. And of course, I very much echo the sentiment. Now let's turn to our third quarter earnings results. The prese ntation is
available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in  the back.
Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $13.2 billion, EPS of $4.33 on revenue of $40.7 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 22%.
These results included $669 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate and $665 million of Firmwide legal expense. On page 2,
we have some more detail.
Similar to last quarter, we have called out the impact of First Republic where relevant. For this quarter, First Republic con tributed $2.2 billion of
revenue, $858 million of expense and $1.1 bi llion of net income. Now, focusing on the Firmwide results, excluding First Republic, revenue of
$38.5 billion was up $5 billion, or 15% year -on-year.
NII ex. Markets was up $4.8 billion, or 28%, driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in Car d, partially offset by lower deposit
balances. NIR ex. Markets was up $374 million, or 4%, which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior ye ar. And Markets
revenue was down $190 million, or 3% year -on-year.
Expenses of $20.9 billion were up $1.7 billion, or 9%, year -on-year, primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing
as well as wage inflation and higher legal expense. And credit costs were $1.4 billion, predominantly driven by net charge -offs in Card an d
included a $102 million net reserve release, driven by changes in the central scenario, primarily offset by Card loan growth.
On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 14.3%, up about 50 basis points versus t he prior
quarter, as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by AOCI. We had $2 billion of net share  repurchases this
quarter, and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the Basel III Endgame proposal. In  line with our capital hierarchy, we will
continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge.
And on the topic of the Basel III endgame, you'll see that we added a couple of pages on it, so let's cover that now sta rting on page 4. Given
the significance of this proposal for us, the broader industry, as well as households and businesses as end -users, we thought it was important
to spend time discussing it. And while we know there's interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular
detail, it's important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by pol icymakers that
banks are well -capitalized and well -positioned to deal with st ress.
Given that context, the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and the re's a lot that does
not make sense to us. Starting with RWA, we've already said we expect the firm's RWA to increase by aro und 30% or $500 billion, which
results in capital requirements increasing by about 25% or $50 billion.
One immediate thing to point out is that at 4.5% GSIB, a $500 billion increase in RWA requires $22.5 billion of additional ca pital with no
change in our  systemic risk footprint. We've been on the record for a long time. The GSIB was conceptually flawed and mis -calibrated
originally; since implementation, the failure to address economic growth, despite the Fed themselves acknowledging this probl em at the o utset
has made matters worse. And now, all of those problems are being applied to an additional $500 billion of RWA.
Our view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with G SIB buffer
constant rather than simply multiplying the RWA increase by the existing surcharges. Another lense on the proposed increases is the
introduction of RWA for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the Stress Cap ital Buffer. Although
there's limited disclosure from the Fed on this point, we have estimated that we have about $15 billion of operational risk c apital embedded in
the SCB based on the information the Fed does disclose. Once we capitalize with this new op risk RWA, our required capital will go up by
around $30 billion without any change to our portfolio.
Now, let's turn to page 5 which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years. Zooming ou t from the details
of this mo st recent proposal, this page reminds us of what's happened since 2017. Since then, SA -CCR and the Stress Capital Buffer have
been adopted, and our GSIB surcharge will increase to 4.5%. So assuming the Basel III Endgame and GSIB proposals are finalize d in their
current form, we would see a 45% increase in our capital requirements relative to that 2017 starting point. This illustrates again how over
calibrated these proposals are, and it's not done yet. We still expect the Fed to incorporate CECL into CCAR, which will likely increase the
SCB. And of course, given the absence of a fix to the GSIB flaws it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite futur e. And aside from
those dynamics, there remains the longstanding issue of procyclicality in the over all capital framework.
We think it's also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here. While it may technically be true  that the proposal is
Basel compliant, Basel compliance does not mandate a 25% increase in capital requirements. Implementing the Basel III Endgame
consistently with how the Europeans have, by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of GS IB and SCB,
would have achieved Basel compliance without creating this unnecessary  increase in capital requirements.
As you would expect, we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond, in a great deal  of technical
detail. For the purposes of this call, we wanted to make the equally important br oader points about both the level of capital increase and the
flaws in the construct of the framework itself, since coherent design is critical to the framework's durability over time. Th e current proposal
exacerbates existing features that discourage bene ficial scale and diversification. If it goes through as written, there will likely be significant
impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers.
In addition, the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market  making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic
changes of the current operation of the U.S. capital markets. We believe that well -regulated market makers that are committed to deploying
capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical b uilding block supporting the breadth, depth and resilience of the American capital markets,
which is vital to the U.S. economy. So, caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude.
With that, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 6. Consumer spend growth has now reverted to pre -pandemic trends, with
nominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat year -on-year. Cash buffers continued to normalize to pre -pandemic levels, with lower
income groups normalizing faster.
Turnin g now to the financial results, excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $5.3 billion on revenue of $17 billion w hich was up
19% year -on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 30% year -on-year, driven by higher NII on higher rates . End -of-period
deposits were down 3% quarter -on-quarter. We ranked number one in Retail deposit share based on FDIC data and continued to solidify our
leadership position in key markets. Client investment assets were up 21% year -on-year, driven by market performance and strong net inflows
as we continue to capture yield -seeking flows from our Consumer Banking customers.
In Home Lending, revenue was down 2% year -on-year, given a smaller market. Originations of $10.3 billion were up slightly quarter -on-
quarter, but they remain down 15% year -on-year.
Moving to Card Services & Auto – revenue was up 7% year -on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially
offset by lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 16% year -on-year, due to strong account acquisition and continued
normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were up $10.2 billion, up 36% year -on-year, as we saw competitors pull back and we gained
market share.
Expenses of $8.5 billion were up 7% year -on-year, largely driven by continued investments in staffing, primarily in front office and technology.
In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.4 billion, driven by net charge -offs, which were up $720 million year -on-year,
predomina ntly due to continued normalization of Card. The net reserve build of $49 million reflected a $301 million build in Card Serv ices,
primarily offset by a $250 million release in Home Lending.
Next, the CIB on page 7. CIB reported net income of $3.1 billion , on revenue of $11.7 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was
down 6% year -on-year. IB fees were down 3% year -on-year, and we ranked number one with a year -to-date wallet share of 8.6%. In Advisory,
fees were down 10%. Underwriting fees wer e up 8% for debt and down 6% for equity.
In terms of the outlook, we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in September, and we have a healthy pipeli ne going into the
fourth quarter. Advisory has also picked up compared to the first half,  but year -to-date announced M&A remains down significantly, which will
continue to be a headwind. Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 3% year -on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was up 12% driven by
higher rates, partially offset by lower deposit b alances.
Moving to Markets – total revenue was $6.6 billion, down 3% year -on-year, against a very strong third quarter last year. Fixed Income was up
1%, driven by an increase in financing and trading activity in Securitized Products, as well as improved performance in Credit. This was
predominantly offset by Currencies and Emerging Markets coming off a very strong quarter last year. Equity Markets was down 1 0%,
reflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prior -year quarter, as activity was challenged by lower volatility. Securities
Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 9% year -on-year, driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances. Expenses of $7.4
billion were up 11% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher leg al expense and wage inflation.
Credit costs were net benefit of $185 million, driven by a net reserve release of $230 million reflecting the impact of net l ending activity and net
charge -offs of $45 million.
Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 8. Comme rcial Banking reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 20%
year-on-year, with Payments revenue of $2 billion, up 30% year -on-year, driven by higher rates. And Gross Investment Banking and Markets
revenue of $821 million was up 8%  year-on-year, reflecting increased M&A volume.
Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 15% year -on-year, largely driven by an increase in headcount, including front office and technology
investments, as well as higher volume -related expense, including the impac t of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 7% year -
on-year, 5% quarter -on-quarter, primarily driven by lower non -operating deposits as clients opt for higher yielding alternatives.
Loans were up 1% quarter -on-quarter. C&I loans were flat, reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization. And
CRE loans were up 1%, reflecting funding of prior year originations in Real Estate Banking, as well as lower payoff activity.
Finally, credit costs were $64 million,  including net charge -offs of $50 million and a net reserve build of $14 million.
Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 9. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.1 billion, with pr e-tax margin
of 31%. Revenue of $4.6 billion was  relatively flat year -on-year, as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market
levels were offset by lower performance fees and lower NII from deposits. Expenses of $3.1 billion were up 3% year -on-year, driven by
continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the J.P. Morgan Asset Management China and Global Shares
acquisitions.
For the quarter, net long -term inflows were $20 billion, positive across all asset classes led by Equities. And in liquid ity, we saw net inflows of
$40 billion. AUM of $3.2 trillion was up 22% year -on-year and client assets of $4.6 trillion were up 21% year -on-year, driven by continued net
inflows of higher market levels. Finally, loans were flat quarter -on-quarter, while de posits were down 5%, driven by migration to investments,
partially offset by client inflows.
Turning to Corporate on page 10. Corporate reported net income of $911 million, revenue was $1.5 billion, up $1.8 billion com pared to last
year. NII was $2 billio n, up $1.2 billion year -on-year, due to the impact of higher rates. And NIR was a net loss of $506 million and included the
net investment securities losses I mentioned upfront. Expenses of $456 million were up $151 million year -on-year.
To finish, we hav e the outlook on page 11. We now expect 2023 NII and NII ex. Markets to be approximately $88.5 billion and $89 billion,
respectively, with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed. Consistent with what we've been saying thro ughout the year,
while we don't know when it will normalize, we do not consider this level of NII to be sustainable.
Our outlook for 2023 adjusted expense is now approximately $84 billion. And as a reminder, this is on an adjusted basis, whic h excludes legal
expense . Also, remember this outlook excludes the pending FDIC special assessment.
And on credit, we now expect the 2023 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 2.5%, mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent
balance growth.
So to wrap up, we're p leased with another quarter of strong operating results. Throughout the year we've been pointing out the various
sources of significant uncertainty in all of those, including the geopolitical situation, economic outlook, rate environment,  deposit reprice a nd
the impact of the Basel III Endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past. But as always, we con tinue to
prepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most.
And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.","Starting on page 1, the firm reported net income of $13.2 billion, EPS of $4.33 on revenue of $40.7 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 22%.

2023_Q4,"Thank you and good morning everyone. The presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the b ack. Starting
on page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.3 billion, EPS of $3.04 on revenue of $39.9 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 15%. These
results included the $2.9 billion FDIC special assessment and $743 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate.
On page 2, we have more on our fourth quarter results. Simi lar to prior quarters, we have called out the impact of First Republic where
relevant. You'll also note that we have now allocated certain deposits, which were previously in CCB, to the appropriate line s of business. For
the quarter, First Republic contrib uted $1.9 billion of revenue, $890 million of expense and $647 million of net income.
Now focusing on the Firmwide fourth quarter results excluding First Republic, revenue of $38.1 billion was up $2.5 billion or  7% year -on-year.
NII ex. Markets was up $2. 2 billion or 11%, predominantly driven by higher rates. NIR ex. Markets was up $139 million or 1%, and Markets
revenue was up $141 million or 2%. Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $4.6 billion or 24% year -on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC
special a ssessment and higher compensation, including wage inflation and growth in front office and technology.
And credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge -offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $474 million. Net charge -offs were up $1.3
billion, predominantly driven by Card and single name exposures in Wholesale, which were largely previously reserved. The net re serve build
was primarily driven by loan growth in Card and a deterioration in the outlook related to commercial real estate valuat ions in the Commercial
Bank.
Looking at the full year results on page 3, the firm reported net income of $50 billion, EPS of $16.23 and revenue of $162 bi llion. And we
delivered an ROTCE of 21%. On to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quar ter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, up 70 basis points
versus the prior quarter, primarily driven by net income, OCI gains and lower RWA, partially offset by a continued modest pac e of capital
distributions as the firm builds towards the proposed Basel III Endga me requirements.
Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5. Total debit and credit card spend was up 7% year -on-year, driven by strong
account growth, and consumer spend remained stable. Turning now to the financial results excluding Fir st Republic, CCB reported net income
of $4.4 billion on revenue of $17 billion, which was up 8% year -on-year.
In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was up 6% year -on-year, reflecting higher NII on higher rates, largely offset by lower deposits with
average balances down 8% year -on-year. Client investment assets were up 25%, driven by market performance and strong net inflows – in
fact, it's been a record year for retail net new money. In Home Lending, revenue was up $230 million, predominantly driven by  the absence of
an MSR loss this quarter versus the prior year, and higher NII.
Moving to Card Services & Auto – revenue was up 8% year -on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially
offset by lower Auto lease income. C ard outstandings were up 14%, due to strong account acquisition and continued normalization of revolve.
And in Auto, originations were $9.9 billion, up 32% as we gained market share, while retaining strong margins.
Expenses of $8.7 billion were up 10% yea r-on-year, largely driven by compensation, including an increase in employees, primarily in bankers,
advisors and technology, and wage inflation, as well as continued investments in marketing and technology. In terms of credit  performance
this quarter, cre dit costs were $2.2 billion, largely driven by net charge -offs, which were up $791 million year -on-year, predominantly due to
continued normalization in Card. The net reserve build of $538 million reflected loan growth in Card.
Next, the CIB on page 6. Th e CIB reported net income of $2.5 billion on revenue of $11 billion. Investment Banking revenue of $1.6 billion was
up 13% year -on-year. IB fees were also up 13% year -on-year and we ended the year ranked number one with a wallet share of 8.8%. In
Advisory,  fees were up 2%. Underwriting fees were up significantly compared to a weak prior -year quarter, with debt up 21% and equity up
30%.
We are starting the year with a healthy pipeline, and we are encouraged by the level of capital markets activity, but anno unced M&A remains a
headwind, and the extent as well as the timing of capital markets normalization remains uncertain. Payments revenue was $2.3 billion, up 10%
year-on-year. Excluding equity investments, it was flat as fee growth was predominantly offset by deposit -related client credits.
Moving to Markets, total revenue was $5.8 billion, up 2% year -on-year. Fixed Income was a record fourth quarter, up 8%. It was another
strong quarter in our Securitized Products business, which was partially offset by lo wer revenue in Rates coming off a strong quarter last year.
Equity Markets was down 8%, driven by lower revenue in Derivatives and Cash. Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year -
on-year. Expenses of $6.8 billion were up 4% year -on-year, p redominantly driven by the timing of revenue -related compensation. Credit costs
were $210 million, reflecting net charge -offs of $121 million and a net reserve build of $89 million.
Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 7. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion. Revenue of $3.7 billion was up 7% year -
on-year, largely driven by higher NII, where the impact of rates was partially offset by lower deposit balances. Payments revenu e of $2 billion,
was up 2% year -on-year, driven by fee growth, la rgely offset by deposit -related client credits. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue
of $924 million, was up 32% year -on-year, primarily reflecting increased capital markets and M&A activity.
Expenses of $1.4 billion were up 9% year-on-year, driven by an increase in employees, including front office and technology investments, as
well as higher volume -related expense, including the impact of new client acquisition. Average deposits were down 6% year -on-year, primarily
driven by l ower non -operating deposits as clients continued to opt for higher yielding alternatives and flat quarter -on-quarter as client balances
are seasonally higher at year -end.
Loans were down 1% quarter -on-quarter. C&I loans were down 2%, reflecting lower revo lver utilization and muted demand for new loans as
clients remain cautious. And CRE loans were flat, as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payoff acti vity. Finally,
credit costs were $269 million, including net charge -offs of $127  million and a net reserve build of $142 million, driven by a deterioration in our
commercial real estate valuation outlook.
And then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 8. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $925 million – with p re-tax
margin of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was up 2% year -on-year, driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average
market levels, predominantly offset by lower NII. The decrease in NII reflects lower deposit margins and balance s, partially offset by wider
spreads on loans.
Expenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year -on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including performance -based incentives;
continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, the impact of closing J .P. Morgan Asset Management China acquisition and the
continued investment in Global Shares.
For the quarter, net long -term inflows were $12 billion – positive across Equities and Fixed Income – and $140 billion for the full year. In
liquidity, we saw net  inflows of $49 billion for the quarter and net inflows of $242 billion for the full year. And we had record client asset net
inflows $489 billion for the year. AUM of $3.4 trillion and client assets of $5 trillion were both up 24% year -on-year, driven by continued net
inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter -on-quarter and deposits were up 7% quarter -on-quarter.
Turning to Corporate on page 9. Corporate reported a net loss of $689 million. Revenue of $1.8 billion was up $597  million year -on-year. NII of
$2.5 billion, was up $1.2 billion year -on-year due to the impact of higher rates and balance sheet mix. NIR was a net loss of $687 million,
compared with a net loss of $115 million and included the net investment securities lo sses I mentioned upfront. And expenses of $3.4 billion
were up $3 billion year -on-year, predominantly driven by the FDIC special assessment.
With that, let's pivot to the outlook for 2024, starting with NII on page 10. We expect 2024 NII ex. Markets to be  approximately $88 billion.
Going through the drivers, the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve, which currently includes six cuts this ye ar. On deposits, we
expect balances to be very modestly down from current levels. While lower rates sho uld decrease repricing pressure, we remain asset
sensitive, and therefore, lower rates will decrease NII, resulting in more normal deposit margins. We expect strong loan grow th in Card to
continue, but not at the same pace as 2023. Still, this should help offset some of the impact of lower rates. Outside of Card, loan growth will
likely remain muted.
It's important to note that we just reported a quarterly NII ex. Markets run rate of $94 billion. Combining that with the ful l year guidance of
approximately $88 billion implies meaningful sequential quarterly declines throughout 2024 consistent with what we've been telling you for
some time. And keep in mind that many of the sources of uncertainty that we've highlighted previously surrounding the NII out look r emain.
And on total NII, we expect it to be approximately $90 billion for the full year, reflecting an increase in Markets NII which , as always, you
should think of as largely offset in NIR.
Now, let's turn to expenses on page 11. We expect 2024 adjusted expense to be about $90 billion. You'll see on the slide, we provided detail
by line of business. Generally, you can see that both in dollar terms and in percentage terms, the expense growth is aligned to where the
greatest opportunities are, both in terms  of share and available returns. And of course you'll hear more at Investor Day and between now and
then.
On the right -hand side of the page, we've highlighted some Firmwide drivers. Thematically, the biggest driver is what I might call busines s
growth wr it large. Within that, narrowly defined volume and revenue -related growth represents about $1 billion of the increase across the
company as a result of an improved NIR outlook compared to about $400 million in 2023. But in addition, the ongoing growth of  the company,
which continues to produce share gains and additional profitability, is coming with increased expense across a range of categ ories.
The quantum of investment increase is comparable to last year's increase and is driven by all the same themes, bankers, branches, advisors,
technology, as well as marketing. Net net, First Republic produces a modest increase in expenses, but with a significantly lo wer 2024 exit run
rate as the result of business integration efforts. Finally, despite significantly l ower inflation outlook and the economy as a whole, we still see
some residual effects of inflation flowing through most of our expense categories.
It's worth noting that both the general business growth and investment growth include decisions that have be en executed both in response to
market conditions during 2023 and to support the future growth and profitability of the company. We've included the fourth qu arter 2023 exit
rate on the page to illustrate that a significant portion of the year -on-year incre ase in expense is already in the run rate.
Now, let's turn to page 12 and cover credit and wrap up. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge -off rate to be below 3.5%,
consistent with Investor Day guidance. So, in closing, we shouldn't le ave 2023 without noting what an outstanding year it was, producing
record revenue and net income despite some notable significant items. We're very proud of what we accomplished this year and want to thank
everyone who made it possible. At the same time, w e emphasized throughout 2023 the extent to which we were over -earning, as indicated by
an ROTCE that is 4% above our through -the-cycle target.
As we turn to 2024, it shouldn't be surprising that our outlook has us beginning to march down the path towards normalization of our returns.
But, despite the expected dissipation of the 2023 tailwinds and the presence of significant economic and geopolitical uncerta inties, we remain
optimistic about this franchise's ability to produce superior returns through a bro ad range of environments, and this management team
remains laser -focused on executing for shareholders, clients and communities.
And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.","on page 1, the firm reported net income of $9.3 billion, EPS of $3.04 on revenue of $39.9 billion and delivered an ROTCE of 15%.

2024_Q1,"Thank you very much, and good morning, everyone. The presentation is available on our website  and please refer to the disclaimer in the
back.
Starting  on page 1  – the firm reported net income of $13.4 billion, EPS of $4.44 on revenue of $4 2.5 billion  and delivered an ROTCE of 21%.
These results included a $725 million increase to the special assessment resulting from the FDIC's updated estimate of expected losses from
the closures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. Touching on a co uple of highlights. Firm wide IB fees were up 18% year -on-year,
reflecting particular strength in underwriting fees, and we've seen strong net inflows across AWM as well as in the CCB Wealt h Management
business.
On page 2, we have some more detail. This i s the last quarter we'll discuss results excluding First Republic given that, going forward, First
Republic results will naturally be included in the prior period, making year -on-year results comparable. For this quarter, First Republic
contributed $1.7 bi llion of revenue, $806 million of expense and $668 million of net income.
Now, focusing on the Firmwide results excluding First Republic  – revenue of $40.9 billion was up $1.5 billion or 4% year -on-year. NII ex .
Markets was up $736 million or 4%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates as well as higher revolving bal ances in Card,
largely offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances in CCB. NIR ex . Markets was up $1.2 billion  or 12%, driven by higher
Firmwide Asset Management and Investment Banking fees as well as lower net investment securities losses. And Markets revenue was down
$400 million or 5% year -on-year.
Expenses of $22 billion were up $1.8 billion or 9% year -on-year, driven by higher compensation, including growth in employees and the
increase to the FDIC's special assessment. And credit costs were $1.9 billion, reflecting net charge -offs of $2 billion and a net reserve release
of $38 million. Net charge -offs were up $ 816 (sic)  million, predominately driven by Card.
On the balance sheet and capital, on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15%, relatively flat versus the prior quarter, reflecting
net income which was predominantly o ffset by higher RWA and capital distribution. This quarter's higher RWA is largely due to seasonal
effects including higher client activity in Markets and higher risk weights on deferred tax assets, partially offset by lower  Card loans.
Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4. Consumers remain  financially healthy supported by a resilient labor market.
While cash buffers have largely normalized, balances are still above pre -pandemic levels and wages are keeping pace with inflation. W hen
looking at a stable cohort of customers, overall spend is in line with the prior year.
Turning now to the financial results , excluding First Republic. CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $16.6 billion, which was
up 1% year -on-year. I n Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 4% year -on-year, reflecting lower NII on lower deposits with
average balances down 7%, as our CD mix increased. Client investment assets were up 25% year -on-year, driven by market p erformance
and strong net inflows. In Home Lending, revenue was up 10% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII and production revenue.
Originations, while still modest, were up 10%.
Moving to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 8% year -on-year, driven by higher Card Services NII on higher revolving balances, partially
offset by higher Card acquisition costs from new account growth and lower auto lease income. Card outstandings were up 13% du e to strong
account acquisition and the continued normal ization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were $8.9 billion, down 3%, while we maintained
healthy margins and market share.
Expenses of $8.8 billion were up 9% year -on-year, largely driven by field compensation and continued growth in technology and m arketing. In
terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $1.9 billion, driven by net charge -offs which were up $825 million year -on-year,
predominately due to continued normalization in Card. The net reserve build was $45 million, reflectin g the build in Card, largely offset by a
release in Home Lending .
Next, the Corporate & Investment Bank on page 5. Before reporting CIB's results, I want to note that this will also be the la st quarter we will
report earnings for the CIB and CB as standal one segments. Between now and Investor Day, we will furnish an 8 K with historical results
including five quarters and two full years of history consistent with the structure of the new Commercial and Investment Bank segment, in line
with the re -organization that was announced in January.
Turning back to this quarter, CIB reported net income of $4.8 billion on revenue of $13.6 billion. Investment Banking revenue  of $2 billion was
up 27% year -on-year. IB fees were up 21% year -on-year and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In Advisory, fees
were down 21%, driven by fewer large completed deals. Underwriting fees were up significantly, benefiting from improved marke t conditions ,
with debt up 58% and equity up 51 %.
In terms of the outlook, while we're encouraged by the level of capital markets activity we saw this quarter, we need to be m indful that some
meaningful portion of that is likely pulling forward from later in the year. Similarly, while it was encouragi ng to see some positive momentum in
announced M&A in the quarter, it remains to be seen whether that will continue and the Advisory business still faces structural headwinds from
the regulatory environment. Payments revenue was $2.4 billion, down 1% year-on-year, as deposit margin normalization and deposit -related
client credits were largely offset by higher fee -based revenue and deposit balances.
Moving to Markets, total revenue was $8 billion, down 5% year -on-year. Fixed income was down 7%, driven by lower activity in Rates and
Commodities compared to a strong prior -year quarter, partially offset by strong results in Securitized Products. Equity Markets was flat.
Securities Services revenue of $1.2 billion was up 3% year -on-year. Expenses of $7.2 bi llion were down 4% year -on-year, predominantly
driven by lower legal expense.
Moving to the Commercial Bank on page 6. Commercial Banking reported net income of $1.6 billion. Revenue of $3.6 billion was up 3% year -
on-year, drive n by higher non -interest revenue. Gross Investment Banking and Markets revenue of $913 million was up 4% year -on-year, with
increased IB fees largely offset by lower markets revenue compared to a strong prior  year quarter.
Payments revenue of $1.9 billio n was down 2% year -on-year, driven by lower deposit margins and balances, largely offset by fee growth net
of higher deposit -related client credits. Expenses of $1.5 billion were up 13% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation,
reflecting an increase in employees including front office and technology investments, as well as higher volume -related expense.
Average deposits were down 3% year -on-year, primarily driven by lower non -operating deposits and down 1% quarter -on-quarter, reflecting
seasonally lower balances. Loans were flat quarter -on-quarter. C&I loans were down 1 %, reflecting muted demand for new loans as clients
remain cautious. And CRE loans were flat as higher rates continued to have an impact on originations and payof f activity.
Finally, credit costs were a net benefit of $35 million, including a net reserve release of $101 million and net charge -offs of $66 million.
Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 7. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1 billion, with pre -tax margin
of 28%. Revenue of $4.7 billion was down 1% year -on-year. Excluding net investment valuation gains in the prior year, revenue was up 5%,
driven by higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels, partially offset by lower NII due to deposit margin
compression.
Expenses of $3.4 billion were up 11% year -on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue -related compensation,
continued growth in our private banking adv isor teams and the impact of the J .P. Morgan Asset Management China acquisition as well as
higher distribution  fees.
For the quarter, long -term net inflows were $34 billion, led by Equities and Fixed Income. AUM of $3.6 trillion was up 19% year -on-year and
client assets of $5.2 trillion were up 20% year -on-year, driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were down
1% quarter -on-quarter and deposits were flat.
Turning to Corporate on page 8, Corporate reported net income of $918 million. Revenue was $2.3 billion, up $1.3 billion year -on-year. NII
was $2.5 billion, up $737 million year -on-year driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates. NIR was a net loss of $188 million.
The current  quarter included net investment securities losses of $366 million compared with net securities losses of $868 million in the prior
year quarter. Expenses of $1 billion were up $889 million year -on-year, predominately driven by the increase to the FDIC special assessment.
To finish up, we have the outlook on page 9. We now expect NII ex . Markets to be approximately $89 billion based on a forward curve that
contained three rate cuts at quarter  end. Our total NII guidance remains approximately $ 90 billion, which implies a decrease in our Market s NII
guidance from around $2 billion to around $1 billion. The primary driver of that reduction is balance sheet growth and mix sh ift in the Markets
business, and as a reminder, changes in Markets NII a re generally revenue neutral.
Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91 billion, reflecting the increase to the FDIC special assessment I mentioned  upfront. And on
credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge -off rate to be below 3.5%.
Finally, you may have noticed that our effective tax rate has increased this quarter and it will likely stay around 23% this year absent discrete
items, which can vary quite a bit. The driver of this change is the firm's adoption of the proportional amort ization method for certain tax equity
investments. Our managed rate is unchanged and it should average about 3.5% above the effective tax rate. This is a smaller g ap than we
previously observed and we expect this approximate relationship to persist going f orward although the difference will continue to fluctuate as it
has in the past.
For the avoidance of doubt, these changes have no meaningful impact on expected annual net income ; we're just mentioning this to help with
your models.
So, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating results even as the journey towards NII normalization begins. While we
remain confident in our ability to produce strong returns and manage risk across a range of scenarios, the economic, geopolit ical and
regulatory uncertainties that we have been talking about for some time remain prominent and we are focused on being prepared to navigate
those challenges as well as any others that may come our way.
And with that, let's open up the line for Q&A.","Starting  on page 1  – the firm reported net income of $13.4 billion, EPS of $4.44 on revenue of $4 2.5 billion  and delivered an ROTCE of 21%.

2024_Q2,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $18.1 billion, EPS of $6.12 on rev enue of $51
billion, with an ROTCE of 28%. These results included the $ 7.9 billion net gain related to Visa shares and the $1 billion Foundation
contribution of the appreciated Visa stock. Also included is $546 million of net investment securities losses in Corporate. E xcluding these
items, the Firm had net income of $13.1 bi llion, EPS of $4.40, and an ROTCE of 20%.
Touching on a couple of highlights. In the CIB, IB fees were up 50% year -on-year and 17% quarter -on-quarter, and Markets revenue was up
10% year -on-year. In CCB, we had a record number of first -time investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and
Card, and we've continued to see strong net inflows across AWM.
Now, before I give more detail on the results, I just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer explicitly calling o ut the First
Republic contribution in the presentation. Going forward, we'll only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in  the year -on-year
comparison. As a reminder, we acquired First Republic in May of last year, so the prior -year quarter  only has two months of First Republic
results compared to the full three months this quarter. Also, in the prior -year quarter, most of the expenses were in Corporate, whereas now
they are primarily in the relevant line of business.
Now, turning to page 2  for the Firmwide results. The Firm reported revenue of $51 billion, up $8.6 billion or 20% year -on-year. Excluding both
the Visa gain that I mentioned earlier, as well as last year's First Republic bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion, revenue of $43.1 b illion was
up $3.4 billion or 9%. NII ex. Markets was up $568 million or 3%, driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates,  higher revolving
balances in Card, and the additional month of First Republic -related NII, partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit
balances.
NIR ex. Markets was up $7.3 billion or 56%. Excluding the items I just mentioned, it was up $2.1 billion or 21%, largely driv en by higher
Investment Banking revenue and Asset Management fees. Both periods inc luded net investment securities losses. And Markets revenue was
up $731 million or 10% year -on-year. Expenses of $23.7 billion were up $2.9 billion or 14% year -on-year. Excluding the Foundation
contribution I previously mentioned, expenses were up 9%, prim arily driven by compensation, including revenue -related compensation and
growth in employees. And credit costs were $3.1 billion, reflecting net charge -offs of $2.2 billion and a net reserve build of $821 million. Net
charge -offs were up $820 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by Card. The net reserve build included $609 million in Consumer and
$189 million in Wholesale.
On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3%, up 30 basis points versus the pri or quarter,
primarily driven by net income, largely offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. As you know, we completed CCAR a coup le of weeks
ago and have already disclosed a number of the key points. Let me summarize them again here. Our preliminary SC B is 3.3%, although the
final SCB could be higher. The preliminary SCB, which is up from the current requirement of 2.9%, results in a 12.3% standard ized CET1 ratio
requirement, which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of 2024. And finally, the Firm an nounced that the board intends to increase the
quarterly common stock dividend from $1.15 to $1.25 per share in the third quarter of 2024.
Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4. CCB reported net income of $4.2 billion on revenue of $17.7 billion, which was
up 3% year -on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 5% year -on-year, reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin
compression, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter -on-
quarter. Client investment assets were up 14% year -on-year, predominantly driven by market performance. In Home Lending, revenue of $1.3
billion was up 31% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher NII, including one addit ional month of the First Republic portfolio.
Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 14% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances.
Card outstandings were up 12% due to strong account acquisition and the co ntinued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originations were
$10.8 billion, down 10% coming off strong originations from a year ago, while continuing to maintain healthy margins. Expense s of $9.4 billion
were up 13% year -on-year, predominantly driven b y First Republic expenses now reflected in the lines of business, as I mentioned earlier, as
well as field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing.
In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecti ng net charge -offs of $2.1 billion, up $813 million year -on-year,
predominantly driven by Card, as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues. The net reserve build was $579 mil lion, also
driven by Card due to loan growth and updates to certa in macroeconomic variables.
Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5. Our new Commercial & Investment Bank reported net income of $5.9 billion on  revenue
of $17.9 billion. You'll note that we are disclosing revenue by business as well as breaking down the Banking & Payments revenue by client
coverage segment in order to best highlight the relevant trends in both important dimensions of the Wholesale franchise. This  quarter, IB fees
were up 50% year -on-year, and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 9.5%. In Advisory, fees were up 45%, primarily driven
by the closing of a few large deals and a weak prior -year quarter. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully, with Equity up 56% and Debt up
51%, benefiting from favorable market conditio ns.
In terms of the outlook, we're pleased with both the year -on-year and sequential improvement in the quarter. We remain cautiously optimistic
about the pipeline, although many of the same headwinds are still in effect. It's also worth noting that pull -forward refinancing activity was a
meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year.
Payments revenue was $4.5 billion, down 4% year -on-year, as deposit margin compression and higher deposit -related client credits were
largel y offset by fee growth. Moving to Markets, total revenue was $7.8 billion, up 10% year -on-year. Fixed Income was up 5%, with continued
strength in Securitized Products. And Equity Markets was up 21%, with equity derivatives up on improved client activity, and we saw record
revenue in Prime and growth in client balances amid supportive equity market levels. Security Services revenue of $1.3 billio n was up 3%
year-on-year, driven by higher volumes and market levels, largely offset by deposit margin compressio n. Expenses of $9.2 billion were up
12% year -on-year, largely driven by higher revenue -related compensation, legal expense, and volume -related non -compensation expense.
In Banking & Payments, average loans were up 2% year -on-year due to the impact of the First Republic acquisition and flat sequentially.
Demand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic
environment, and revolver utilization continues to be below pre -pandemic levels. Also, capital markets are open and are providing an
alternative to traditional bank lending for these clients. In CRE, higher rates continue to suppress both loan origination an d pay -off activity.
Average client deposits were up 2% year -on-year and relativ ely flat sequentially. Finally, credit costs were $384 million. The net reserve build
of $220 million was primarily driven by incorporating the First Republic portfolio in the Firm's modeled approach. Net charge -offs were $164
million, of which about half was in Office.
Then, to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.3 billion, with p re-tax
margin of 32%. Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 6% year -on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and
strong net inflows, as well as higher brokerage activity, largely offset by deposit margin compression. Expenses of $3.5 bill ion were up 12%
year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, primarily revenue -related compensation and continue d growth in our private banking
advisor teams. For the quarter, long -term net inflows were $52 billion, led by Equities and Fixed Income. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of
$16 billion. AUM of $3.7 trillion was up 15% year -on-year, and client assets o f $5.4 trillion were up 18% year -on-year, driven by higher market
levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans and deposits were both flat quarter -on-quarter.
Turning to Corporate on page 7, Corporate reported net income of $6.8 billion on revenue  of $10.1 billion. Excluding this quarter's Visa -related
gain and the First Republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year, NIR was up approximately $450 million year -on-year. NII was up $626
million year -on-year, driven by the impact of balance sheet mi x and higher rates. Expenses of $1.6 billion were up $427 million year -on-year.
Excluding Foundation contribution, expenses were down $573 million year -on-year, largely as a result of moving First Republic -related
expense out of Corporate into the relevant  segments.
To finish up, we have the outlook on page 8. Our 2024 guidance including the drivers remains unchanged from what we said at In vestor Day.
We continue to expect NII and NII ex. Markets of approximately $91 billion, adjusted expense of about $92 billion, and on credit, Card net
charge -off rate of approximately 3.4%.
So, to wrap up, the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net incom e, or more
importantly, after excluding the significant it ems, the underlying performance continues to be quite strong. And, as always, we remain focused
on continuing to execute with discipline.

2024_Q3,"Thank you and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $12.9 billion, EPS of $4.37 on revenue of $43.3
billion with an ROTCE of 19%. Touching on a couple of highlights. In CCB, we ranked number one in retail deposit share for th e fourth straight
year, in CIB, both IB fees and Markets rev enue were notably up year -on-year reflecting strength across the franchise. In AWM, we had record
quarterly revenues and record long -term flows.
Now, turning to page 2 for the Firmwide results. The Firm reported revenue of $43.3 billion, up $2.6 billion or 6% year -on-year. NII ex. Markets
was up $274 million or 1% driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment, higher revolvi ng balances in Card and
higher wholesale deposit balances, predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in Banking & Wealth Management and deposit margin
compression.
NIR ex. Markets was up $1.8 billion or 17%, but excluding the prior year’s net investment securities losses, it was up 10% on  higher asset
management and investment banking fees. And Markets revenue was up $535 million or 8% year -on-year.
Expenses of $22.6 billion were up $808 million or 4% year -on-year, driven by compensation, including revenue -related compensation and
growth in employees, partially offset by lower legal expense. And credit costs were $3.1 billion reflecting net charge -offs of $2.1 billion and a
net reserve build of $1 billion, which included a $182 million in Consumer, primarily in Card, and $144 million in Wholesale.  Net charge -offs
were up $590 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by Card.
On to balance sheet and capital on page 3. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.3%, flat versus the prior quarter, as  net income and
OCI gains were offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter's RWA reflects higher lending activity,  as well as higher client
activity and market moves on the trading side.
We had $6.0 billion of net common share repurchases this quarter, which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the sale of Visa
shares, as we have previously mentioned.
Now, let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 4. CCB reported net income of $4.0 billion on revenue of $17.8 bil lion, which was
down 3% year -on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue was down 11% year -on-year, reflecting deposit margin compression and
lower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenue. Average deposits were down 8% year -on-year and 2% sequentially.
We're seeing a slowdown in customer yield -seeking activity including in CD volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder
of the year.
Client investment assets were up 21% year -on-year driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth
management clients from our branch network. In Home Lending, revenue was up 3% year -on-year, driven by higher NII, partial ly offset by
lower servicing and production revenue.
Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 11% year -on-year, driven by higher Card NII on higher revolving balances. Card
outstandings were up 11% due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve. And in Auto, originati ons were $10
billion, down 2%, while maintaining strong margins and high -quality credit. Expenses of $9.6 billion were up 5% year -on-year, predominantly
driven by higher field and technology compensation as well as growth in marketing.
In terms of credit performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.8 billion driven by Card, and reflected net charge -offs of $1.9 billion, up $520
million year -on-year, and a net reserve build of $876 million predominantly from higher revolving balances.
Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 5. The CIB reported net income of $5.7 billion on revenue of $17 billion. IB f ees were up
31% year -on-year and we ranked number one with year -to-date wallet share of 9.1%. In Advisory, fees were up 10% benefit ing from the
closing of few large deals. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 26%, primarily driven by fa vorable market
conditions.
In light of the positive momentum throughout the year, we're optimistic about our pipeline, but the M&A regulatory environmen t and
geopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty. Payments revenue was $4.4 billion, up 4% year -on-year, driven by  fee growth and
higher deposit balances, largely offset by margin compression.
Moving to Markets. Total revenue was $7.2 billion, up 8% year -on-year. Fixed Income was flat reflecting outperformance in Currencies &
Emerging Markets and lower revenue in Rates. Equities was up 27% reflecting strong performance across regions, largely driven by a
supportive trading environment in the U.S. and increased late -quarter activity in Asia.
Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 9% year -on-year, largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes.
Expenses of $8.8 billion were down 1% year -on-year, with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenue -related compensation
and growth in employees, as well as higher technology spend.
Average Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year -on-year and down 1% sequentially. In the middle market and large corporate client
segments we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients’ access to rec eptive capital
markets. In multi -family, while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as long -term rates fall, we expect overall growth to remain
muted in the near term as originations are offset by payoff activity.
Average client deposits were up 7% year -on-year and 3% sequentially, primarily driven by growth from large corporates in Payments and
Securities Services. Finally, credit costs were $316 million, driven by higher net lending activity, including in Markets,  and downgrades,
partially offset by improved macroeconomic variables.
Then to complete our lines of business, AWM on page 6. Asset & Wealth Management reported net income of $1.4 billion with pre -tax margin
of 33%. For the quarter, revenue of $5.4 billion was up 9% year -on-year, driven by growth in management fees on higher average market
levels and strong net inflows, investment valuation gains compared to losses in the prior -year, and higher brokerage activity, partially offset by
deposit margin compression.
Expenses of $3.6 billion were up 16% year -on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue -related compensation
and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense. For the quarter, long -term net
inflows were $72 billion, led by Fixed Income and Equities. And in liquidity, we saw net inflows of $34 billion. AUM of $3.9 trillion and client
assets of $5.7 trillion were both up 23%, [year -on-year] driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows. And finally, loans were up
2% quarter -on-quarter, and deposits were up 4% quarter -on-quarter.
Turning to Corporate on page 7. Corporate reported net income of $1.8 billion. Revenue was $3.1 billion, up $1.5 billion year -on-year. NII was
$2.9 billion, up $932 million year -on-year, predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securitie s reinvestment, including from
prior quarters.
NIR was a net gain of $155 million compared with a net loss of $425 million in the prior year, predominantly driven by lower net investment
securities losses this quarter. Expenses of $589 million were down $107 million year -on-year.
To finish up, let's turn to the outlook on page 8. We now expect 2024 NII ex. Markets to be approximately $91.5 billion and t otal NII to be
approximately $92.5 billion. Our outlook for adjusted expense is now about $91.5 billion. And given where we are in the year, we included on
the page, the implied fourth quarter guidance for NII and adjusted expense, and note, that the NII numbers imply about $800 m illion of Markets
NII in the fourth quarter. On credit, we continue to expect the 2024 Card net charge -off rate to be approximately 3.4%.
So, to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance. As we look ahead to the next few quarters , we expect
results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues, but we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue
delivering excellent returns through the cycle.
And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.","Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $12.9 billion, EPS of $4.37 on revenue of $43.3

2024_Q4,"Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14 billion, EPS of $4.81 on revenue of $43.7
billion, with an ROTCE of 21%. On page 2, we have more on our fourth-quarter results. The Firm reported revenue of $43.7 billion, up $3.8 billion
or 10% year-on-year. NII ex. Markets was down $548 million or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and the associated deposit margin
compression, as well as lower deposit balances in CCB, largely offset by the impact of securities reinvestment, higher revolving balances in
Card and higher wholesale deposit balances. NIR ex. Markets was up $3.1 billion or 30%. Excluding the prior year's net investment securities
losses, it was up 21%, largely on higher asset management fees and investment banking fees. And Markets revenue was up $1.2 billion or 21%.
Expenses of $22.8 billion were down $1.7 billion or 7% year-on-year. Excluding the prior year's FDIC special assessment, expenses were up $1.2
billion or 5%, predominantly driven by compensation as well as higher brokerage and distribution fees. And credit costs were $2.6 billion,
reflecting net charge-offs of $2.4 billion and a net reserve of $267 million. On page 3, you can see the reported results for the full year. I'll
remind you that there were a number of significant items in 2024. Excluding those items, the Firm reported net income of $54 billion, EPS of
$18.22, revenue of $173 billion, and we delivered an ROTCE of 20%. Touching on a couple of highlights for the year. In CCB, we had a record
number of first-time investors and acquired nearly 10 million new card accounts. In CIB, we had record revenue in Markets, Payments and
Securities Services. And in AWM, we had record long-term net inflows of $234 billion, positive across all channels, regions and asset classes.
On to balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.7%, up 40 basis points versus the prior quarter, as net
income and lower RWA were largely offset by both OCI losses and capital distributions, which included $4 billion of net common share
repurchases this quarter. The $24 billion decrease in RWA reflects a seasonal decline in Markets activity and lower wholesale lending, which
was predominantly offset by a seasonal increase in Card. Now, let's go to our businesses starting with CCB on page 5.
CCB reported net income of $4.5 billion on revenue of $18.4 billion, which was up 1% year-on-year. In Banking & Wealth Management, revenue
was down 7% year-on-year on deposit margin compression and lower deposits, partially offset by growth in Wealth Management revenues.
Average deposits were down 4% year-on-year and flat sequentially as consumer balances have stabilized. Client investment assets were up
14% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see healthy flows across branch and digital channels. In
Home Lending, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher production revenue. Turning to Card Services & Auto,
revenue was up 14% year-on-year, largely driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances. Card outstandings were up 11% due to strong
account acquisition and revolve growth. And in Auto, originations were $10.6 billion, up 7%, reflecting higher lease volume on robust new
vehicle inventory.
Expenses of $9.7 billion were up 4% year-on-year, predominantly driven by field compensation and growth in technology. In terms of credit
performance this quarter, credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.1 billion, up $428 million year-on-year, driven by Card.
The net reserve build was $557 million, predominantly driven by higher Card revolving balances.
Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $6.6 billion on revenue of $17.6 billion. IB fees were up 49%
year-on-year, and we ranked number 1 with wallet share of 9.3% for 2024. Advisory fees were up 41%, benefiting from large deals and share
growth in a number of key sectors. Underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up 56% and equity up 54%, primarily driven by favorable
market conditions. In terms of the outlook for the overall investment banking wallet, in light of the positive momentum, we remain optimistic
about our pipeline. Payments revenue was $4.7 billion, up 3% year-on-year, excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances
and fee growth and largely offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was $1.9 billion, up 9% year-on-year, predominantly driven
by lower losses on hedges.
Moving to Markets, total revenue was $7 billion, up 21% year-on-year. Fixed Income was up 20% with better performance in Credit as well as
continued outperformance in Currencies & Emerging Markets. Equities was up 22% on elevated client activity and Derivatives amid increased
volatility and higher trading volumes in Cash. Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 10% year-on-year, driven by fee growth on higher
client activity and market levels, as well as higher deposit balances. Expenses of $8.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by
higher brokerage, technology and legal expense. Average Banking & Payments loans were down 2% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially.
Global Corporate & Investment Banking loans were down 2% quarter-on-quarter, driven by paydowns and lower short-term financing,
primarily offset by new originations.
In Commercial Banking, Middle Market loans were also down 2% driven by paydowns, predominantly offset by new originations. And
Commercial Real Estate loans were flat as new originations were offset by paydowns. Average client deposits were up 9% year-on-year and 5%
sequentially, driven by underlying client growth. Finally, credit costs were $61 million driven by net downgrade activity and the net impact of
charge-offs, largely offset by a reserve release due to an update to certain loss assumptions. Then, to complete our lines of business, Asset &
Wealth Management on page 7.
AWM reported net income of $1.5 billion with pre-tax margin of 35%. Revenue of $5.8 billion was up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by
growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows, as well as higher performance fees. Expenses of $3.8
billion were up 11% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and continued
growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $76 billion for the quarter, positive
across all asset classes. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $94 billion for the quarter and $140 billion for the full year. And we had client asset
net inflows of $468 billion for the year. AUM of $4 trillion and client assets of $5.9 trillion were both up 18% year-on-year driven by continued
net inflows and higher market levels. And finally, loans were up 2% quarter-on-quarter and deposits were up 5% quarter-on-quarter. Turning to
Corporate on page 8.
Corporate reported net income of $1.3 billion. Revenue of $2 billion was up $223 million year-on-year. NII of $2 billion was down $415 million
year-on-year, driven by the impact of lower rates, largely offset by balance sheet actions, primarily securities reinvestment activity. NIR was a
net loss of $30 million, compared with a net loss of $668 million in the prior year, driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter.
And expenses of $550 million were down $3 billion year-on-year, predominantly driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment of $2.9
billion in the prior year. With that, let's pivot to the outlook, starting with NII on page 9.
We expect 2025 NII ex. Markets to be approximately $90 billion. Going through the drivers, as usual, the outlook assumes that rates follow the
forward curve. It's worth noting that the NII decrease is driven by both the cut expected in 2025 and the impact of the 100 basis points of cuts
in the back half of 2024. You can see on the page that we've illustrated the historical trajectory of Card loan growth. We expect healthy Card
loan growth again this year, but below the 12% pace we saw in 2024 as tailwinds from revolve normalization are largely behind us. Turning to
deposits, Firmwide deposits have stabilized and we expect to see a more visible growth trend assert itself in the second half of 2025. It's
notable that we can already see that trend in consumer checking deposits. On deposit margin, we expect modest compression due to lower
rates. When you put all that together, we expect the NII trough could be sometime in the middle of the year, followed by growth as we
illustrated at the bottom of the bar. And for completeness, we expect Firmwide NII to be approximately $94 billion as a function of Markets NII
increasing to about $4 billion, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR.
Finally, I want to point out that starting this quarter, we are including an estimate of earnings-at-risk in the earnings supplement so you no
longer have to wait for the K or the Q to get that number. Now, let's turn to expenses on page 10. We expect 2025 (sic) [adjusted] expense to be
about $95 billion. Looking at the chart in the middle of the page, I'll touch on the drivers of the year-on-year change, which you'll note are very
consistent with what you've been hearing from us recently. The largest increase is volume-and revenue-related expense, which is primarily
driven by expected growth in Auto leasing, as well as capital markets. As a reminder, this comes with higher revenues. We continue to hire
bankers and advisors to support business growth as well as expand our branch network. The increase in tech spend is primarily business
driven as we continue to invest in new products, features and customer platforms, as well as modernization. Marketing remains a driver of
spend as we continue to see attractive opportunities, resulting in strong demand and engagement in our Card business. And finally, while we
haven't explicitly called it out in each bar, inflation remains a source of some upward pressure. And as always, we are generating efficiencies to
help offset it. Now let's turn to page 11 to cover credit and wrap up.
On credit, we expect the 2025 Card net charge-off rate to be in line with our previous guidance of approximately 3.6%. So in closing, 2024 was
another year of record revenue and net income, and we're proud of what we accomplished. As we look ahead to 2025, we still expect NII
normalization, although to a lesser extent than we previously thought. And taking a step back, we think it's important to acknowledge the
tension between the risks and uncertainties in the environment and the degree of optimism embedded in asset prices and expectations. In that
context, we remain upbeat about the strength of the franchise, but we are focused on being prepared for a wide range of scenarios.
Finally, let me say a few words about the wildfires in Los Angeles. While we don't expect much of a financial impact from it, we have a presence
in the area across all three lines of business, so we're keeping in close contact with our customers, clients and employees. We are offering
support in a variety of ways, including waiving consumer and business banking fees as well as making a contribution to local relief
organizations, offering employee donation matching and supporting employee volunteer efforts.
With that, I'll turn it over to Jamie before we open up the line for Q&A.
Good morning, everybody. I just want to point out that Daniel Pinto is not leaving the company yet, so it's a bit premature what I'm about to do. I
just wanted to say and I'd be remiss not to say, he was a young man who joined the company at 20 years old in Argentina. He ran trading in
Argentina, then he ran trading for Latin America, then he ran global emerging markets trading, then he ran fixed income trading and then
became co-head of the Investment Bank and then sole head of the Investment Bank for 10 years. Over that whole time, helped me build one of
the great investment banks in the world. And then, obviously, was President for five years or more; a great partner of mine, trusted by everyone
at the company. So we're thrilled to have his skills and talents going forward, but I just wanted to recognize the contributions he made.

2025_Q1,"Thank you and good morning, everyone. Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14.6 billion, EPS of $5.07 on revenue of $46
billion, with an ROTCE of 21%. These results included a First Republic-related gain of $588 million, which was previously disclosed in the 10-K.
On page 2, we have more on our first-quarter results. The Firm reported revenue of $46 billion, up $3.5 billion, or 8% year-on-year. NII ex.
Markets was down $430 million, or 2%, driven by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, as well as lower deposit balances
in CCB. This was predominantly offset by higher Card revolving balances, the impact of securities activity, including from prior quarters, as well
as higher wholesale deposits. NIR ex. Markets was up $2.2 billion, or 20%, and excluding the significant item I just mentioned, was up 14%,
largely on higher asset management fees, lower net investment securities losses and higher investment banking fees. And Markets revenue
was up $1.7 billion, or 21%.
Expenses of $23.6 billion were up $840 million, or 4%, largely driven by compensation, including growth in employees across the front office
and technology, higher brokerage and distribution fees, as well as marketing and legal expense.
The quarter also reflected a $323 million release of the FDIC special assessment accrual compared with a $725 million increase in the prior
quarter. Credit costs were $3.3 billion, with net charge-offs of $2.3 billion and a net reserve build of $973 million. We have more details on the
reserve build on page 3. With this quarter's reserve build, the Firm’s total allowance for credit losses is $27.6 billion.
Let's take a second to add a little bit of context to our thinking surrounding this number in light of the unique environment of the last several
weeks. Our first quarter allowance is anchored on the relatively benign central case economic outlook, which was in effect at the end of the
quarter. But, in light of the significantly elevated risks and uncertainties at the time, we increased the probability weightings associated with
the downside scenarios in our CECL framework. As a result, the weighted-average unemployment rate embedded in our allowance is 5.8%, up
from 5.5% last quarter, driving the $973 million increase in the allowance.
So with that in mind, the consumer build of $441 million was driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook. The
wholesale build of $549 million was predominantly driven by credit quality changes on certain exposures and net lending activity, as well as
changes in the outlook. In addition, it's important to note that the increase in the allowance is not, to any meaningful degree, driven by
deterioration in the actual credit performance in the portfolio, which remains largely in line with expectations.
With that, let's go to the balance sheet and capital on page 4. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 15.4%, down 30 basis points versus the
prior quarter as net income and OCI gains were more than offset by capital distributions and higher RWA. This quarter, the Firm distributed $11
billion of capital to shareholders, which reflects $7.1 billion of net common share repurchases and the payment of our common dividend, which
has been increased to $1.40 per share. This quarter's higher RWA is primarily driven by overall business growth in Markets and some seasonal
effects.
Now let's go to our businesses, starting with CCB on page 5. Consumers and small businesses remain financially healthy. Despite the recent
downtrends in consumer and small business sentiment, based on our data, spend, cash buffers, payment to income ratios, and credit
utilization are all in line with our expectations.
Moving to the financial results, CCB reported net income of $4.4 billion on revenue of $18.3 billion, which was up 4% year-on-year. In Banking &
Wealth Management, revenue was down 1% year-on-year, driven by lower deposit NII, predominantly offset by growth in Wealth Management
revenue. Average deposits were down 2% year-on-year and flat sequentially, while end of period deposits were up 2% quarter-on-quarter.
Client investment assets were up 7% year-on-year, predominantly driven by market performance, and we continue to see strong flows into
managed products.
In Home Lending, revenue was up 2% year-on-year and originations were up 42% year-on-year, off a small base in a slowly growing market.
Turning to Card Services & Auto, revenue was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by Card NII on higher revolving balances as well as
higher operating lease income in Auto. Card outstandings were up 10%, due to strong account acquisition. And in Auto, originations were $10.7
billion, up 20%, driven by higher lease volume.
Expenses of $9.9 billion were up 6% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in marketing and technology, higher field compensation, as
well as higher auto lease depreciation. Credit costs were $2.6 billion, reflecting net charge-offs of $2.2 billion, up $275 million year-on-year,
predominantly driven by the seasoning of recent vintages in Card with delinquencies and losses in line with expectations. The net reserve build
was $475 million, of which $400 million was in Card.
Next, the Commercial & Investment Bank on page 6. CIB reported net income of $6.9 billion on revenue of $19.7 billion, which was up 12% year-
on-year. IB fees were up 12% year-on-year, and we ranked number one with wallet share of 9%. In Advisory, fees were up 16%, benefiting from
the closing of deals announced in 2024. Net underwriting fees were up 16%, primarily driven by elevated refinancing activity, particularly in
Leveraged Finance. In Equity underwriting, fees were down 9% year-on-year, reflecting challenging market conditions.
In light of market conditions, we are adopting a cautious stance on the Investment Banking outlook. While client engagement and dialog is
quite elevated, both the conversion of the existing pipeline and origination of new activity will require a reduction in the current levels of
uncertainty.
Payments revenue was up 3% year-on-year excluding equity investments, driven by higher deposit balances and fee growth, predominantly
offset by deposit margin compression. Lending revenue was up 11% year-on-year, driven by lower losses on hedges, partially offset by lower
balances.
Moving to Markets, total revenue was up 21% year-on-year, reflecting record performance in Equities. Fixed Income was up 8% with better
performance in Rates and Commodities against a relatively weak prior-year quarter. Equities was up 48% as the business performed well
during a period of elevated volatility, supported by higher client activity and strong monetization of flows, particularly in Derivatives.
Securities Services revenue was up 7% year-on-year, driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances, partially offset by deposit margin
compression.
Expenses of $9.8 billion were up 13% year-on-year, predominantly driven by higher compensation, legal and brokerage expense. Average
Banking & Payments loans were down 3% year-on-year and down 1% sequentially as we continued to observe payoff activity and limited
demand for new loans across client segments. Average client deposits were up 11% year-on-year and up 2% sequentially, reflecting increased
activity across Payments and Securities Services. Finally, credit costs were $705 million, largely driven by the net reserve build.
Then to complete our lines of business, Asset & Wealth Management on page 7. AWM reported net income of $1.6 billion with pre-tax margin
of 35%. Revenue of $5.7 billion was up 12% year-on-year, predominantly driven by growth in management fees on strong net inflows and higher
average market levels, as well as higher brokerage activity and higher deposit balances.
Expenses of $3.7 billion were up 7% year-on-year, largely driven by higher compensation, including revenue-related compensation and
continued growth in our private banking advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees. Long-term net inflows were $54 billion for the
quarter, primarily driven by Equity and Fixed Income. In liquidity, we saw net inflows of $36 billion.
AUM of $4.1 trillion and client assets of $6 trillion were both up 15% year-on-year, driven by continued net inflows and higher market levels. And
finally, loans were up 5% year-on-year and flat quarter-on-quarter, and deposits were up 7% year-on-year and down 2% sequentially.
Turning to Corporate on page 8. Corporate reported net income of $1.7 billion. Revenue of $2.3 billion was up $102 million year-on-year. NII of
$1.7 billion was down $826 million year-on-year. NIR was a net gain of $653 million compared with a net loss of $275 million in the prior year.
The current quarter included the significant item I mentioned upfront, while the prior-year quarter included net securities losses of $336 (sic)
[$366] million.
Expenses of $185 million were down $1.1 billion year-on-year, driven by the changes to the FDIC special assessment accruals I mentioned
upfront.
To finish up, let's turn to the full year outlook on page 9. We continue to expect NII ex. Markets to be approximately $90 billion. The Firmwide
NII outlook has increased to about $94.5 billion, reflecting an increase in Markets NII, which you should think of as being primarily offset in NIR.
Our adjusted expense outlook continues to be about $95 billion. And on credit, we expect the Card net charge-off rate to be in line with our
previous guidance of approximately 3.6%.
So to wrap up, we're pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance – but of course, the focus right now is on the future, which
is obviously unusually uncertain. But no matter what outcomes eventually materialize, we are eager to do our part to continue to support our
clients, the markets and the broader economy, and we believe the banking system will be a source of strength in this dynamic environment.
And with that, let's open the line for Q&A.","Starting on page 1, the Firm reported net income of $14.6 billion, EPS of $5.07 on revenue of $46
